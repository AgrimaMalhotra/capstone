Balram4, where it is held that the proper approach should be to see whether relevant data and material referred to in the report of the Commission justify its conclusions. As far as the individual provisions are concerned, the learned senior counsel has mounted his attack on Section 4 of the impugned Act being violative of Articles 13, 32, 226 and 227. Further, according to the learned senior counsel, the contradictory provisions of the impugned Act are evidenced from plain reading of Sections, 2, 3 and 5 on one hand, for the purpose of providing reservation the legislature seeks to extend the benefits available to SC/ST and OBC vis-a-vis the creamy layer distinction. However, for the purpose of section 5, the legislature seeks to hold SEBC Maratha community as a separate and distinct from OBC. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the State legislature has chosen to approbate and reprobate by framing provisions to only selectively benefits the Maratha community. He would also further assert that Section 2(j) which defines the term 'SEBC' is also violating the essence of Article 14 as the legislature is attempting to create a class of Marathas within the already existing class of 4 1972 (1) scc 660 patil-sachin.

4,"It is not disputed before us that the requisite ceremonies for a valid marriage under the personal law of the parties have been gone into in this case, although the marriage is null and void by reason of the provisions of sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This Act was passed with the object of amending and modifying the law relating to marriages among Hindus. Under the customary law, there was no restriction for a male Hindu to marry more than one women. This right of the Hindu husband under the customary Hindu Law was curtailed for the first time in the then Bombay Province by enacting the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriage Act, 1946, provisions whereof declared bigamy to be illegal. Under the provisions of the said Act and other similar laws enacted by other Provincial Legislatures, a second marriage by a Hindu person during the life time of the spouse was declared illegal and going through such a marriage was made penal. Consistent with the object of codifying the marriage laws amongst Hindus, all these State laws were repealed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for the conditions for solemnisation of marriage between any two Hindus. Section 11 declares that a marriage solemnised after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void if it contravenes any of conditions specified in Clause (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5. One of the conditions for a marriage as required by section 5 is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage, and this is condition No. (i) in section 5. Section 11 also gives a remedy to either party to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration by a decree of nullity of marriage on any one of the said three conditions of section 5 being shown to the have been contravened. Obviously, the second marriage in such circumstances being void, it cannot create a legal status of husband and wife between the parties. It is true that section 11 also gives a right to the parties to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration of nullity by a decree of the Court , but the filing of the petition or passing the decree is not a condition precedent for putting an end to the marriage. What ultimately is declared on such a petition is nothing but the status of the party as on the date of the marriage, and therefore, the marriage does not continue to remain valid until a decree is passed. What is null and void cannot be deemed to be in existence for any purposes whatsoever. Under the circumstances, if a marriage is solemnised in contravention of any of the said three conditions referred to in section 5(i), the woman cannot get the status of the wife nor the male gets the status of a husband qua her. The second marriage does not continue to be valid till the passing of the decree for a nullity. The position is also clear from the fact that bigamy is made penal by section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides that any marriage between two Hindu solemnised after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living and the provisions of sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly. The position is made further clear from the anxiety of the legislature to protect children of such a marriage by providing in section 16 that not withstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. However, the rights of such a child are somewhat curtailed in the matter of inheritance to the property, because sub-section (3) of section 16 says that a child of such a marriage would not be entitled to any rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Having regard to all these provisions, the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent was void ab initio and the respondent could not get the status of a legally wedded wife inspite of the solemnisation of the marriage under the Hindu Law having gone into. Indeed, Mr. Gavnekar did not dispute this legal position. He, however, contended that the provisions of section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act conferred a right of maintenance on the second wife and the word ""wife"" in section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to be given a wider meaning as including a Hindu wife whose marriage may be otherwise void.","['5','11','16','17','3','16','25']"

7,"In the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) it is seen that the Will was dated 16.7.1950 and under the Will the property which was given to the widow was to provide for the maintenance of the widow. In spite of the fact that the Will in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) gave the property towards maintenance yet the Supreme Court held that the property which was given for maintenance by such wording of the Will, however the property given as a life-estate has to be taken as being given towards a pre-existing right of maintenance which existed under the shastric law and/or Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and therefore the property given as life-interest for maintenance would be converted into a full ownership. In para 12 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) reference is made to the judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) and it is observed that judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) proceeded on the basis that the right of a Hindu male to dispose of his property is absolute and therefore there is a right to create a limited/restricted estate/life-estate in favour of a female but however if the right to maintenance can be read as being given in recognition of pre-existing rights as per C. Masilamani Mudaliar's case (supra), then the property given for maintenance would be taken out of Section 14(2) and would be included under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. Para 26 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar's (supra) holds that when interpretations have to be given to the provision of a statute then the same should be in conformity with the constitutional goals to remove any handicap or discrimination against a Hindu female and all that was required for a property which is given as a life-estate to a Hindu female for becoming a full owner thereof was that the Hindu female must be found to have a pre-existing right either under the personal law or any other law of the country and that this personal law or other law would include right to maintenance under the law of the country which is the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. This is so categorically clarified in the very first line of para 29 of the said judgment where it is specified that the widow in C. Masilamani Mudaliar's case (supra) had a pre-existing right to maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act when the property was given to her for maintenance. I would like to note that the provision of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act which is not stated in para 29 is the provision of Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act which gives right to the wife for maintenance from the property of her husband. Second line of para 29 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar's (supra) lays down a specific ratio that once there is a pre-existing right of a Hindu wife to maintenance because of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, then because of this reason the property given to the Hindu female has to be taken in lieu of her pre-existing right to maintenance and therefore the property given under the Will for a limited right of a life- estate, the life-estate will blossom into full ownership because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. Referring to para 28 of the judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) in the later para 29 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra), the Supreme Court has observed in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) that the restrictive interpretation put by the Bench of two Judges in the case of Gumpha (supra) that the life-estate will remain a life-estate is not sound in law and the Division Bench in the case of Gumpha (supra) did not approach the problem from a correct prospective by interpreting right of life-estate given under the Will only as a life-estate and not to have become a full ownership which it should be as per Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. In para 29 by referring to V. Tulasamma and Others Vs. Sesha Reddy (Dead) by Lr's (1977) 3 SCC 99, it is observed that a right acquired under a Will can be because of pre-existing right of maintenance under the shastric law, and once that pre-existing right to maintenance exists, under the shastric law then because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act the restrictive estate given under the shastric law is wiped out and the widow becomes absolute owner of the property. The judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) was therefore set aside by holding that what is required to be seen is not the language of the Will as to whether by the Will a Hindu husband gave the property to the wife as a life-estate or for maintenance but the issue was whether what is given as a life-estate or maintenance to the widow/wife is or is not because of a pre-existing right, and that since a pre-existing right clearly exists either under a shastric law or under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, and once there does exist a pre-existing right for a life-estate to be created or for maintenance to be given, then the limited interest/life-interest/life-estate will get converted into the full ownership because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act which specifically lays down that once there is a pre-existing right then what is given pursuant to a document being a Will would not result in a restrictive estate but the life-estate would become a full ownership","['14','18']"
8,"It is therefore seen that in Gumpha's case (supra) there was a Will executed in favour of the widow which specifically gave only a life-estate. Supreme Court held in Gumpha's case (supra) that the life-interest/life-estate in favour of a widow did not convert the life-interest/life-estate into a full ownership because by a Will a Hindu male had a right to give restricted ownership in his property to his widow. Supreme Court has in para 9 in Gumpha's case (supra) specifically held that legislature was aware of the unrestricted power of the Hindu male to dispose of his property and which is recognized as Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act and therefore such right to give full estate by a Hindu male cannot be curtailed by converting the life-estate into full estate and the Will granting the life-estate has to be taken as a document/instrument which is covered under Section 14(2) and not Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. In para 12 of the judgment in Gumpha's case (supra) Supreme Court has observed that a Hindu can bequeath his interest even in a joint property and the effect on the right of the widow of the testator given as life-estate for maintenance is for maintenance and not in lieu of maintenance i.e life-estate is given for maintenance and not in lieu of maintenance, and consequently the life-estate granted to the widow falls under Section 14(2) and not under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act.

9,"With great respect, we are afraid this may not be the proper construction of Section 29 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act Section 29 (2) did not operate to incorporate into the Hindu Marriage Act any provision of the Nair Act or any right recognised thereunder. That section only limited the operation of the provisions of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for that matter other provisions too) to cases other than those contemplated by Section 29 (2) of the Act, cases in which, as we have said earlier, provisions had been made ia the special enactments. The provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to such cases by reason of Section 29 (2). That provision cannot be read as incorporating any provision of or right under the special enactment into the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Judge further finds-",['29']
10,"The express provision in the sub-section would save the rights recognised by custom conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of Hindu marriage. Therefore if there was a special enactment in force which conferred a right to obtain dissolution, the provision with regard to dissolution of marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act would not affect such right. The field of operation of the right to dissolution conferred under the Hindu Marriage Act was restricted in its scope by reason of Section 29 (2) of the Act. It was operative in all cases other than those to which Section 29 (2) would apply. In other words the right to obtain dissolution under the Hindu Marriage Act did not extend to cases where provision has been made for that purpose in special enactments. In such cases the special enactment would continue to operate. The words ""nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect any right"" in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Act clearly indicate the limited scope of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, limited in the sense that it will not override the provisions in special enactments conferring right to obtain dissolution of Hindu marriage. In that view the provisions of the Nair Act which conferred a right to obtain dissolution of marriage on certain specific grounds and by resort to a specific procedure would remain in force not because such right was conferred by Section 29 (2) but Section 29 (2) limits the operation of Section 13 to cases other than those covered, among other laws by Nair Act 1100. In that view Section 4 (b) will not be applicable, for, that renders any law inoperative only in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision contained in the Act. Nair Act is not inconsistent with any provision contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, for, Section 13 limited in its operation to cases other than those covered by Section 29 (2) would not be inconsistent with cases covered by Section 29 (2). In other words the provisions of Nair Act concerning the right to obtain dissolution of marriage are not inconsistent with Section 13 of the Act.","['29','2','4','13']"
11,"After the passing of the Hindu Succession Act, by virtue of Section 14 of that Act, a widow gets an absolute interest in her deceased husband's property possessed by her. If Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act was to apply to cases where a Hindu widow has got an absolute interest in her deceased husband's property, that will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act and, therefore, invalid to the extent of inconsistency by virtue of the provisions of Section 4 (l) (b) of the Hindu Succession Act. Learned Counsel for the appellant placed reliance on Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, according to which, in absence of the heirs expressly mentioned in Clause (a) of Sub-section (11. the property inherited by a female Hindu from her father or mother was on her dying intestate to devolve on the heirs of her father while the property inherited by a female Hindu from her husband was to devolve upon the heirs of the husband. According to him, this showed that the intention of the makers of the Hindu Succession Act was that the property in the hands of a Hindu female should not go out of the hands of the branch to which it originally belonged. Section 15 applies only to cases where a female Hindu dies intestate","['2','4','11','14','15']"
12,"I am in entire agreement with my learned Brother Mukharji, J. that Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act is inconsistent with Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, and, therefore, in cases, where a Hindu widow gets absolute right by inrcritanee in her husband's property, she cannot be divested of that right by virtue of Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act. In my opinion, Section 2 aforesaid merely divests a Hindu widow on re-marriage of limited interest held by her. It has been expressly so stated with regard to her husband's property coming to her by virtue of any Will or testamentary disposition. If the interest conferred upon her in her husband's property by virtue of will or testamentary disposition is not limited but absolute, the section has got no application. It appears that the section has also got no application where she gets her deceased husband's property by virtue of a non-testamentary disposition. Rights and interest acquired by her in her husband's property by inheritance, to her husband or to his lineal successors were limited interest before the passing of the Hindu Succession Act.","['2','14']"

16,"The difficulty arises because the word ""fraud"" is not defined in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. But in my opinion, the provisions of Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act cannot apply to fraud as understood in Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is necessary to bear in mind that there is a difference between the marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 and the marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Special marriage Act, 1954 provides a special form of marriage in certain cases. It is permissible to a Hindu, by virtue of this Act, to have his marriage with another Hindu or a person belonging to any other community solemnized in accordance with the requirements of the Act: The rights, obligations and status of the parties to such civil marriage in matters relating to restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, nullity of marriage and divorce are regulated by the provisions contained in that Act. The succession to property of two Hindus married under that Act as also to the property of the issues of such marriage is governed by the relevant provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and not by the Hindu Law of succession. It is significant to notice that no ceremonies are necessary for the marriage being valid under that Act. Obviously, therefore, the marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, is a contract. The position under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, however, is different. It is needless to say that marriage under the Hindu Law is treated as a samskara or a sacrament. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, contemplates a ceremonial marriage which must be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of one of the two parties. Non-observance of the essential customary rites and ceremonies of at least one of the parties would amount to failure to solemnize the marriage. In other words, a marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act which is not solemnized by performance of the essential ceremonies is, under the Act, no marriage at all: It is true that the conditions laid down in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act must also be fulfilled before a marriage under that Act is gone through. But the non-fulfilment of every one of the conditions and requirements enacted in Section 5 does not ipso facto render the marriage null and void or even voidable: It seems to me, therefore, that under the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage which is a ceremonial marriage which is a ceremonial marriage is essentially a sacrament (Samskara).","['5','12','17']"
17,"The learned Judge of the original Court referring to Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act held that the conditions of that section for invoking the jurisdiction of his Court were not satisfied inasmuch as neither was the marriage solemnised within the jurisdiction of his Court, nor was it the case that the husband and wife resided or last resided together within the jurisdiction of his Court. It was claimed before the learned Judge that even if conditions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not complied with, in the instant case the Court would have jurisdiction under Section 20, Civil Procedure Code, which was expressly made applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act by Section 21.","['19','20','21']"
18,"The applicant has new come up to this Court and has reiterated the same contentions. It is undoubtedly a somewhat peculiar case. The Hindu Marriage Act was passed by Parliament in 1955 and became the law on 18th May 1955. Under the Act certain rights have been for the first time created in favour of Hindu spouses who are citizens of this country. One of those rights is for husband or wife to obtain a decree for divorce in respect of marriage solemnised even before the commencement of this Act if one or the other of the conditions in Section 13 of the Act are satisfied. The question is whether the enforcement of this right which has been created by the Hindu Marriage Act, can be defeated or denied to a Hindu, who is otherwise entitled to it, by an interpretation put on Section 19 of the Act which makes the remedies available under the Act nugatory so far as Hindus whose marriages were solemnised in a territory which was previously a part of India but is now a part of Pakistan and who have separated before the partition, are concerned. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act are to be interpreted in such a manner, then the only result would be that any person in the position of the applicant and the opponent in the instant case would not he entitled to avail of any of the rights or remedies created in respect of spouses, husbands or wives, under the Act, whether the marriages were solemnised before cr even after the Act. In my opinion, that could not be the intention of the law, and in particular, of the provision regarding jurisdiction of the Court created under Section 19 of the Act. It is in this context that the provisions of Section 21, which make applicable the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, have to be interpreted. It is undoubtedly true that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code have been made applicable subject to the provisions of the Act contained therein. Therefore, the proper way of reconciling the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act with the provision as to the right of suing to be found in the relevant provisions of the Cods of Civil Procedure, and in particular, Section 20 of the Code, would be first to see whether the jurisdiction can be invoked by satisfaction of any of the conditions of Section 19 of the Act. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Act had been called into play, then in that case it is those provisions which must be satisfied if they are capable of being satisfied in a particular case. ","['13','19','20','21']"
19,"Under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, appeal can be preferred against any decision of the Family Court not being an interlocutory order. Under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act the period of limitation is prescribed for orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the stipulation of Section 19(3) are more general in nature inasmuch as they cover not 12 of 23 13 cam.448.14.doc only orders passed by the Family Court under the Hindu Marriage Act but cover all appealable orders passed in proceedings before the Family Court. The stipulations of Section 19(3) of the Family Courts Act being general in nature and Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act as amended being special in nature (in that they refer to one class of cases which fall under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act.)","['19','28']"
20,"Section 14 of the Divorce Act also, in my view, goes a long way to indicate that court cannot, and at any rate, should not decree dissolution solely on the statements made in the petition, event though Section 47 makes them referable as evidence. Section 14 provides that a Court in order to decree dissolution must not only be ""satisfied on the evidence that the case of the petitioner has been proved"", but must also be satisfied that the petition is not presented or prosecuted in collusion with the respondent and that the petitioner has not in any manner been accessory to or conniving at or condoned the adultery complained of. I have no doubt that no court can reasonably come to these findings merely on the statements in the petition without examining the petitioner, more particularly in an undefended case and I would like to refer to the single Judge decision of the Allahabad High Court in Anjula v. Milan , where the learned Judge has taken similar view while considering Section 20(2) and Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, analogous to Section 47 and Section 14, respectively, of the Divorce Act I am, therefore, of the view that I cannot, and, at any rate, could not confirm the decree on the basis of the statements made in the petition, even assuming that these statements, if believed, would have reasonably proved the alleged adultery. I must, however, note that my Lord Mookherjee, J., has indicated during our discussion that the view that no decree can ever be founded on the statements in the petition may be too broad a proposition and that there may be appropriate cases where such statement may form part of the basis for a decree.","['14','20','23']"
21,"The first contention that has been made on behalf of the appellant is that by virtue of the provisions of Section 21 of the HinduMarriage Act the Code of Civil Procedure is made applicable toproceedings under the said Act and so, even if the petition wasnot maintainable under Section 19 of the Act it should have been heldthat the District Court in Delhi had jurisdiction to entertain the petitionby virtue of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil ProcedureThe contention is since the cause of action or a part of the cause ofaction, viz. the failure of the wife to discharge her marital obligationsto the husband at the place where the husband resides, arises at Delhi,the appellant being a permanent resident of Delhi, it should havebeen held that the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction to entertain THE petition. Of this contention there were two facets. First, that byvirtue of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act Section 20 of theCode of Civil Procedure stands incorporated in the said Act, andsecondly, the petition under Section 9 of the Act was a compositepetition or suit and could be treated cither as a petition under theHindu Marriage Act simplicitor or a suit under Section 9 of the Codeof Civil Procedure.","['19','20','21','9']"
22,"To come to this conclusion, we have perused Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as well as Sections 20 and 21 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. It is true that Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 deals with reference to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children. However, in our view, at least prima facie, the said Section cannot be read in isolation. Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, Pg 9 of 20 reserved.cam.25.2017 (Colabawalla).april.18.doc 1956 clearly stipulates that, subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu is bound, during his or her lifetime, to maintain his or her legitimate or illegitimate children and his or her aged or infirm parents. It is further stipulated in the said section that the obligation of a person to maintain his unmarried daughter extends so far as she is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings or other properties. Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 reads thus-","['26','20','21']"
23,"The learned Judge of the original Court referring to Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act held that the conditions of that section for invoking the jurisdiction of his Court were not satisfied inasmuch as neither was the marriage solemnised within the jurisdiction of his Court, nor was it the case that the husband and wife resided or last resided together within the jurisdiction of his Court. It was claimed before the learned Judge that even if conditions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not complied with, in the instant case the Court would have jurisdiction under Section 20, Civil Procedure Code, which was expressly made applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act by Section 21.","['19','20','21']"
24,"If conditions as existing between the parties are such as not to bring Into play the provisions of Section 19 of the Act, then it cannot be said that the action has been commenced at a place and in a Court other than the Court in which it ought to be commenced. Primarily by applicalion of the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act if there is a competition between two juristictions, it is undoubtedly true that that Court will have jurisdiction which satisfies conditions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act. But in the case of a spouse like the petitioner, who cannot satisfy the condition of Section 19, the residuary remedy that is made available to the petitioner by application of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in general, and in particular, of Section 20 regarding the place of suing, must be made available to a litigant for relief under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this aspect of the case, In my opinion, the view taken by the Courts below is not sustainable and the denial of jurisdiction by the first Court will not be justified.","['19','20']"
25,"In our view, on proper construction of the relevant provisions it is not possible to uphold the preliminary objection. In the first place it is difficult to accept the contention that the substantive provision contained in s. 25 C.P.C. is excluded by reason of s. 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely provides: ""Subject to other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in that behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908"". In terms s. 21 does not make any distinction between procedural and substantive provisions of C.P.C. and all that it provides is that the Code as far as may be shall apply to all proceedings under the Act and the phrase ""as far as may be"" means and is intended to exclude only such provisions of the Code as are or may be inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act. It is impossible to say that such provisions of the Code as partake of the character of substantive law are excluded by implication as no such implication can be read into s. 21 and a particular provision of the Code irrespective of whether it is procedural or substantive will not apply only if it is inconsistent with any provision of the Act. For instance, it is difficult to countenance the suggestion that the doctrine of res judicata contained in s. 11 of the Code which partakes of the character of substantive law is not applicable to proceedings under the Act. Res judicata, after all, is a branch or specie of the Rule of Estoppel called Estoppel by Record and though Estoppel is often described as a rule of evidence, the whole concept is more correctly viewed as a substantive rule of law (See: Canada and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships Ltd.",['21']
26,"Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not as such provide for any discretion to be exercised by the Court in the matter of transfer. However, by the introduction of Section 21A, specific provision has been made to deal with a situation where one party has filed a petition before one Court and the other party has filed a petition for a similar relief in the other Court. However, the application of Section 21A is restricted to a petition under Section 10 or a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. But Section 21A is not exhaustive in the matter of transfer of cases. Section 21A does not cover the several situations warranting transfer of one case to the other Court either for simultaneous disposal or for joint trial. These situations are covered by Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The special provision, namely, Section 21A of the Hindu Marriage Act, would not curtail the general power of the Court contained in Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, in cases where a transfer is sought for and it is not covered by Section 21A, still the Court can exercise the power for transfer under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure.","['10','13','21','24']"
27,"The learned counsel Smt. Mira Sarma, on behalf of the petitioner submitted that only appeal lies against all the decrees including ex parte decree, and has referred Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act (Amended in 1976). She further submitted that a petition under Order 9, Rule 13 C.P.C. is not maintainable in view of the clear mandatory provision of Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. On the other hand, the learned counsel Shri B. M. Goswami for the opposite party submitted that a petition under O. 9 Rule 13 will also be maintainable in spite of the provisions under Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, because all proceedings under Hindu Marriage Act are regulated by the Civil P.C. He has referred Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Now the point for decision is, whether a petition under Order 9 Rule 13 is maintainable for setting aside an ex parte decree passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. ","['28-A','21']"
28,"We do not propose to determine that question as we are of opinion that we can record the compromise and decree divorce on that basis under the general procedure provided in Order 23, Rule 3 of the Civil P.C. which applies to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act in view of Section 21 thereof. All that we have said hereinbefore is that we can not decree divorce solely on the basis of compromise unless we are also satisfied that a ground for divorce specified in the Statute can be traced on the record In the case at hand it is on record that the parties have fought with severest bellicosity in the Courts below for about two years, the charge of the husband being mental disorder of the wife and that of the wife being cruelty and physical tenure by the husband. Having lost at the first bout in the trial Court, the husband has filed this appeal and the parties were contesting the same with all severity for about two years in this Court. They are living separately during all these years and both of them have sworn in their joint-affidavit that they have not been nor would be able to live together. To the same effect is their statement before us when we directed them to appear before us in the Chamber to ascertain the truth of their averments made in the joint-application. If the spouses could not live together, do not live together and they swear that they would no longer live or able to live together, then we have no doubt that ""desertion"" by the one of the other is complete whoever might have given the initial cause because all the three elements that generally go to constitute ""desertion"" namely, the factum of separation, the animus deserendi, i.e., the intention to live apart and the animus non-revertendi, i.e., the intention not to revert to the matrimonial home stare at the face. Being thus satisfied as to the existence of a ground justifying divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, we should not and do not have any hesitation to direct recording of the compromise and to decree divorce in accordance with such compromise and we direct accordingly. We have noted that a learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court (Punjab and Haryana High Court) in Davinder v. Loveleen, (1982) 2 DMC 5 and also a learned single Judge of the Bombay High Court in Sudhakarv. Sulabha, (1986) 1 DMC 336 also adopted such a course; but while the learned Delhi (Punj and Har High Court) Judge has not given any reasons therefor the learned Bombay Judge, while spelling out some reasons, has not adverted to the various aspects which we have considered here.",['21']

She further contended that petitioner did not make out any prima facie case, that he did not have balance of convenience for grant of relief in the nature of injunction and no irreparable injury would be caused to him.

When a Family Court deals with the matrimonial disputes of Hindu, it has to only enforce the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 22 of the said Act in this regard is mandatory. The section confers a discretion on the Judge and also grants a right to the parties to have the proceedings held in camera.

Those suits and proceedings are recognised under different statues, one of them being the Hindu Marriage Act. Therefore, sub-Section (2) of Section 23 has not been abrogated or repealed by Section 9. It follows that Section 9 has brought about no change in the legal position that the provisions as contained in sub' Section (2) of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act do not control the proceedings under Section 24 of that Act. Again, the draftman, in Section 9, has taken care to emphasise that an endeavour to bring about a settlement between the parties should be made where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case. It is not intended in Section 9 that even though an indigent spouse can not either maintain himself or herself or prosecute or defend the litigation in which she or he is involved yet the Court should persuade him or her to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceedings.","['7','9','24','23']"

39,"There is no provision in the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act for granting maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings as provided for in Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. Hence, I do not find anything in the scheme of the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act so as to attract the bar of clause (b) of Section 4 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Undoubtedly, if there were to be any other law in force immediately before the commencement of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956, it would cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. However, I do not find any inconsistency between the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and the provisions of Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. In my view, therefore, the argument based on the provisions clause (b) of Section 4 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act has no force. The learned trial Judge has rightly held that having regard to the wild and baseless allegations made by the husband in his Petition for divorce filed in the Mathura Court, the wife could be justified in entertaining an apprehension that it would be dangerous for her to live with the husband.

The very fact that an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is contemplated only as an interlocutory application in a main proceeding and the very fact that an order made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act automatically comes to an end with the disposal of the main proceedings, makes it impossible to accept the submission that the order is not an interlocutory order.",['24']

The petitioner should have filed two separate applications for these two reliefs; but that being a matter of mere form and procedure, if she can make out her case for both the reliefs, the same or any of them should not be denied to her on the ground that she has failed to file two separate sets of paper.",['24']
43,"In view of the above provision, it was contended that when under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. a Hindu wife is disqualified from claiming maintenance from her husband if she is unchaste, the legislature could not have intended by Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act to benefit such a person. The argument is no doubt, attractive, but if examined closely it is devoid of substance. What is contemplated in Section 18 (3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act is the right of a Hindu wife to separate residence and maintenance from her husband. Section 23 of the said Act deals with the quantum of maintenance which a Hindu wife can claim. The residence and maintenance envisaged in Sections 18 and 23 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act are quite different from the maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. We can conceive of cases where an order for judicial separation was the result of single act of infidelity on the part of the wife. Thereafter there was nothing against her conduct. Is it possible for us to assume that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not intended to benefit such a person? We do not think so. That the obiect of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to provide for the payment of maintenance even after the dissolution of a marriage is clear. In those circumstances, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is wider in its scope and ambit than Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Further it is not obligatory under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act to grant maintenance as is required by Section 23 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. It may be that under Section 18 (3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act an unchaste wife will forfeit her separate residence and maintenance granted under that enactment. But that does not mean that the interpretation of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act has to be restricted so as to applv it only to those cases where the wife is not guilty of adultery.",['25']

He would submit that despite passing of decree of annulment of marriage that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act still preserves the right of a woman to claim maintenance and the statute also retained the jurisdiction of the Court passing the said decree for the purpose of granting maintenance either at the time of passing the said decree or even subsequent thereto and as such, the same benefit conferred on such woman of annulled marriage under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to be extended to her to enable her to claim maintenance even under Section 125 Cr.P.C. by bringing her within the sweep of the inclusive definition of ""wife"" on par with a divorcee under clause (b) of explanation to Section 125 Cr.P.C. In other words, it is his contention that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to be read into Section 125 Cr.P.C. and also into clause (b) of explanation to Section 125 Cr.P.C.

The learned Judge also held that since no order was passed under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act for pemanent alimony and maintenance, the appellant cannot seek for enhancement of maintenance under Section 25 (2) of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 Hindu Marriage Act. The reason given by the Appellate Court is erroneous.",['25']
48,"The appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act for enhancement of maintenance on the ground that already, a sum of Rs.1,000/- is granted to her under provisions of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. On misconception, the appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, claiming enhancement of maintenance. A party can claim maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act as well as under Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. In the present case, under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court can consider the claim of party, namely wife herein, for claim of maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, even after disposal of H.M.O.P. for divorce. While granting maintenance under provisions of one Act, the Court has to take into consideration the maintenance already granted under the provisions of other Act and grant proper maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act. The appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, on misconception in view of maintenance already granted under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The Court has discretionary power to convert H.M.O.P filed under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act to Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. A Division Bench of this Court, in the judgment dated 19.03.2021 made in C.M.A.No.1167 of 2017, relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, in the facts and circumstances of the case, converted the proceedings filed under Section 25 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 (1) to 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act and modified the compensation awarded by the Trial Court. In an appropriate cases, in the interest of justice, the Court can convert the wrong provision to correct provision and pass orders. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the respondent is working as a P.G. Assistant Teacher and was earning a sum of Rs.30,000/- per month at the time of filing of H.M.O.P. Due to passage of time and increase of salary granted by the authorities, the respondent will be getting more than Rs.30,000/- per month now. The respondent has not alleged and proved that appellant is having any independent income to maintain herself without support of t",['25']
49,"The first submission of Mr. Pendse learned counsel for the appellant, was that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely confers a remedy but does not confer any right and hence to obtain an order for permanent alimony respondent No. 1 must establish her right under some other provision of law. It was pointed out by Mr. Pendse that neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 can it be said that respondent No. 1 has any right, as the marriage between her and the appellant was null and void and hence she cannot take advantage of the remedy granted by Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In my view, this submission of Mr. Pendse must be rejected. In the first place, on a plain construction of the language used in sub-section (1) of the Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act it is clear that a description is granted to the Court exercising jurisdiction under the Act at the time of passing any decree or thereafter, on application made to t either by the wife or the husband, to order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such sum for her or his maintenance as set out therein. This power conferred upon the Court clearly creates a corresponding right in the wife or the husband to get maintenance provided the conditions laid down for the grant of the same are satisfied. It cannot, therefore, be said that Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act does not create any right at all. Secondly, it must be appreciated that a plain reading of this provision shows that it clearly contemplates that not only the wife but even the husband would in certain circumstance be entitled to get maintenance. Neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 is any right of maintenance given to the husband at all. Hence. if the submission of Mr. Pendse is accepted, it would mean that the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in so far as they deal with the claim of the husband for maintenance, would be redundant; and such a construction should not normally be resorted to. Thirdly, it must be remembered that the Hindu Marriage Act is a codifying Act. It is well settled that the object of codification of a particular branch of law is that on any matter specifically dealt with by it, the law should be sought for in the codifying enactment itself. In view of this, the better construction of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act seems to be that not only does it provide for a remedy but it also confers a right Finally, it must be remembered that the Act of 1956 came into force after the Hindu Marriage Act and hence it could not have been the object of Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act of create a remedy for the enforcement of a right subsequently created by the Act of 1956.",['25']
50,"The next submission of Mr. Pendse was that if the provisions of sub-section (1) of S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are so construed as to entitle persons, who do not enjoy the status of a husband or wife, to get maintenance, such a construction would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of 1956 and in particular Section 18 thereof. It was pointed out by him that the Act of 1956 is a subsequent piece of legislation and under the provisions of Section 4(b) thereof any other law in force immediately before the commencement of that Act ceased to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in that Act. It was urged by Mr. Pendse that under Section 18 of the Act of 1956 the right to claim maintenance was given only to a lawfully wedded Hindu wife, and hence if a wider right is given by sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the provisions thereof would be inconsistent with the provisions of Section 18 of the Act of 1956. In my view, there is no inconsistency between the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and those of Section 18 of the Act of 1956. Assuming that on a true construction of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 a right is conferred only on a lawfully married Hindu wife to claim maintenance, it does not follow that the provisions of another statute where by parties to a Hindu marriage even other than a lawfully wedded Hindu wife are granted rights of maintenance would be inconsistent therewith. Moreover, it is not as if a wider construction of Section 25(1) of the said Act of 1955 would render the provisions of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 redundant. Under sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 of Hindu wife is entitled to claim maintenance from her husband even without filing any petition for nullity or divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights. Whereas there is nothing either in the provisions of Section 24 or Section 25 of the said Act of 1955 which confers any such right. This submission of Mr. Pendse must also be rejected.","['25','4','18']"
51,"In support of his contention Mr. Pendse relied on the decision of a Division Bench of the Madras High court in Narayanaswami v. Padmanabhan, . The question there related directly to the provision of Section 4(1) of the Madras Hindu (Bigamy Prevention and divorce) Act, 1949, with which I am not concerned here. There are, however observation in this decision to the effect that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be construed in such a manner as to hold that notwithstanding the nullity of the marriage the wire reliant her status for purposes of applying for alimony and maintenance. In the first place, these observations are admittedly obiter. The provisions of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not before the Madras High Court for consideration nor were they considered in any detail. This appears clear from the observations to the effect that the proper construction; of Section 25 would be that were a marriage was admittedly a nulity, that section would have no application; but where the question of nullity is in issue and is contentious, the Court has to proceed on the assumption until the contrary is proved that the applicant was the wife. With respect, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with the stage at which a decree has been passed by a Court exercising jurisdiction under that Act or subsequent there to. Assuming that the question whether the marriage was a nulity or not might have been contentious before the decree was passed, once the decree was passed, it would no longer the contentious question. Hence, with great respect , one fails to see the relevance of the above mentioned observation in construing the provisions of Section 25(1) of the said Act. This is only to show that the provision of this subsection never came up directly for construction before the Madras High Court in this case, I may make it clear that with respect, I am unable to agree with the observation of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court which I have referred to above. ON the other hand. I find that the view, which I have taken has also been taken by a Single Judge of the Punjab High Court in Dayal Singh v. Bhajan Kaur, , where it has been observed that the Hindu Marriage Act has not been very carefully drafted and that the language of Section 25 has to be liberally construed.",['25']
52,"While incorporating these provisions in the Act, the Legislature always wanted to secure the interest of female spouse by liberally using the word ""husband"" or ""wife"". Otherwise, the very purpose of providing shelter to a woman will be defeated. The Legislature in its wisdom, if wanted to defeat the rights of a woman who has secured a decree under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, could conveniently say that ""any decree other than the decree obtained under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act"". The moment the proceedings are launched under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, by a husband or by a wife in order to get the maintenance even after the passing of the decree, Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act will come into play as I will presently try to show.",['25']
53,"In fact, their Lordships never said that in such a -circumstance the petition under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not legally maintainable or that she cannot file the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The judgment of this Court reported as AIR 1999 Punjab and Haryana 229, has taken note of a Division Bench decision of Bombay High Court in which the similar proposition of law has been laid down, which was laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.","['24','25']"
54,"In this view of the matter, I am not in a position to endorse the arguments and submissions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Therefore, I hold that respondent has locus standi to file a petition under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act irrespective of the fact that she obtained a decree under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. With that decree, still, she has the right to file an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In this case the maintenance and litigation expenses, which have been granted to the respondent, cannot be held to be on the excessive side. Therefore, I find this revision without any merit and dismiss the same with costs, which are assessed at Rs. 500/-.","['11','24','25']"
55,This appeal would be dismissed in the light of findings recorded in the judgment rendered in relations to the Appeal No. 29 of 2016 and Appeal no. 30 of 2016 vis-Ã - vis the guardianship and custody of the minor child under Section 7 read with Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act and Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act.,"['21','20','26']"
56,It is an appeal where wife has challenged the decree of divorce. Since the wife is agreed for an alimony under Section 25 in appeal No. 27 of 2016 and the same has been enhanced from Rs. 14.00 lakh which was settled in the agreement dated 15.03.2015 and the same has been enhanced to Rs. 18.00 lakh. The acceptance of the permanent alimony would amount to the dissolution as settled by agreement dated 15.03.2015 hence this appeal challenging the decree is dismissed.,['17-A']
57,"We will take up for consideration the point pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Family Court to entertain these petitions. Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, under which orders were passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, giving custody of minor Varun to Usha reads as hereunder : In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree upon aplication by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending, and the Court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made.",['26']
58,"It may be noticed that Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act makes provision for obtaining orders from the Court in which any proceeding under the said Act had been initiated, even after the decree with respect to the custody, maintenance, etc. of the children and the Court is bound to inquire into the said matter as if the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending. It may be noticed that it is not the case of any of the parties that the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay, had made any provision for custody of the child even after the death of Usha. If that has not been done and if still during the minority of Varun, Usha has died, the said Court could make appropriate orders regarding custody of the child even after the death of Usha, as if the proceedings for obtaining the decree were still pending. The later portion of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act enables the said Court before whom the proceeding was pending earlier, to make such orders and provision with respect to the custody of the child even subsequently and therefore, it cannot be said that the said Court cannot give the relief to the parties subsequent to the death of Usha. If the Court before which the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of the marriage were initiated has the jurisdiction even after the decree, to give appropriate directions regarding the custody of the minor child whether it is before or after the death of Usha, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court as also S. 4 of Hindu Marriage Act it has to be held that the appropriate provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act are inconsistent with Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act in such a situation and therefore, the remedy under the Guardians and Wards Act is unavailable to the parties in such a context.",['26']
59,"It was urged on behalf of the father respondent that before the Family Court no plea regarding lack of jurisdiction had been taken by the grand-parents and on the other hand, they had in fact moved the Family Court for appointing them as guardians and it has been raised for the first time before this Court and in view of the Decision of the Supreme Court in PATHUMMA AND ORS. v. KUNTALAN KUTTY AND ORS., AIR 1982 SC 1683 it is not open to the grand- parents to take such a contention and the same deserves to be repelled. It may be noticed that the Supreme Court in this Decision was concerned with the aspect relating to Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure which in turn refers to the objection as to the place of suing and the said Section appears immediately after Section 20 wherein there is a choice for the plaintiff to institute the suit in more than one Court coming within the purview of Sub-clauses (a) (b) and (c). It is in that connection that when objection was taken to the territorial jurisdiction of the Court for the first time in appeal, it was pointed out that all the three conditions mentioned under Section 21 CPC, must co-exist and only in such a case the objection as to the place of suing could be entertained by the Court of appeal or revision. This is not a case where the objection relating to Family Court is being taken on the ground of place of suing. The objection is on account of the fact that there was already an order passed by the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay, in the proceeding initiated before him under the Hindu Marriage. Act by the parents of the minor child and in that proceeding an order had been passed as provided under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and therefore, for any further alteration in that regard the parties and to approach only the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay and that the remedy under the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act is unavailable to the parties in such a context. If that be so, then neither Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Decision pressed into service by the learned Advocate for the father could be of any assistance to hold that the Family.

60,"In her written statement in the main lis, the wife-respondent made a prayer for return of certain articles specified in the schedule thereto, but the trial Judge having decreed the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights, did not make any order in respect of that prayer. The Division Bench on appeal, after allowing the appeal and decreeing divorce, remanded the case of the wife for return of the articles to the trial Court for fresh adjudication under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the evidence on record and on further evidence to be adduced by the parties, but made it clear that it was expressing ""no opinion whether or not the claim of the appellant in respect of the items of property or ornaments mentioned in the Schedule to her written statement can be entertained under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act.""",['27']
61,"In this case, however, even if we hold that the articles directed to be returned by the impugned order are not properties belonging jointly to the husband and the wife and accordingly are not properties covered by Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, nothing would prevent us from recording a compromise to the effect that the wife-respondent has agreed to receive and has in fact received Rs. 15,000/- in lieu of those articles belonging to her in full and final settlement of her claim for return of those articles. For, even if those articles do not come within the ambit of Section 27 or any other provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and are not, therefore, matters which can relate to matrimonial proceedings under the Act, a compromise can still be struck in respect thereof between the parties under the provisions of Rule 5 of Order 23 of the Civil P.C. as they now stand after the Amendment of 1976. Rule 3, as it stood before the Amendment of 1976, provided that the Court on recording an agreement, satisfaction or compromise ""shall pass a decree in accordance therewith so far as it relates to the suit"". The words ""as it relates to the suit"" have now been substituted by the words ""so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same, as the subject matter of the suit."" Therefore, under Rule 3, as it now stands, a Court can pass a decree in accordance with the agreement, satisfaction or compromise between the parties even though the same relates to or covers matters which may not form the subject matter of the suit provided they relate to the parties to the suit and the terms of such a decree would now be executable and are not to be enforced by a separate suit, as was the position prior to the Amendment of 1976. Therefore, even if the articles in question were or could not stricto sensu be the subject matter of a matrimonial proceeding Under the Hindu Marriage Act, as they nevertheless relate to the parties to the proceeding, we would direct recording of the compromise as prayed for. The appeal, therefore, which, as noted hereinbefore, has already ended in a decree for divorce in favour of the respondent-wife against the appellant-husband, shall now stand fully disposed of in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, compromise and satisfaction as recorded in the joint petition filed by the parties, which shall thus form part of the decree. No costs as agreed by and between the parties.",['27']
62,"All the High Courts are unanimous in regard to the scope of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Law says that court is entitled to invoke its powers only if the property belongs jointly to husband and wife. The High Courts of Allahabad, Madhya Pradesh and Bombay, and in the earlier decision the High Court of Delhi, in Anju Bhargava v. Rajesh Bhargava (1986) 2 Hindu L.R. 393, have also taken the view that even if the property belongs to one of the spouses, even though Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act may not apply, invoking Section 151 read with Order 7, Rule 7, C.P.C., relief could be granted and the spouse retaining the property as such can be directed to return the same.",['27']
63,"In Shukla v. Brij Bhushan A.I.R. 1982 Del. 223, the learned Judge did not follow the Allahabad decision referred to. It was held in paragraph 2 of the judgment that Section 27, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a substantive provision empowering the court in any proceeding under the said Act to make a just and proper order regarding property presented at or about the time of the marriage of the parties and belonging to both of them jointly. It was further held that the remedy lay before the Civil Courts. The scope of Section 151, C.P.C. was not considered in that case.",['27']
64,"On going by the various decisions, I agree with the conclusion arrived by the Allahabad, Bombay and Madhya Pradesh High Courts wherein their Lordships have held that under Section 151, C.P.C. the court can give necessary direction regarding the disposal of the property belonging to individual spouses and the same is within the jurisdiction of the Matrimonial Court. Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not a bar, nor does it restrict the power of the Matrimonial court in regard to disposal of the individual properties of the spouses. Merely because a specific provision has been made under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act regarding joint properties of the spouses, it should not be construed that the court has no power or the Court's power is excluded from giving necessary directions with regard to the individual properties.",['27']
65,"It would appear from the above that though there is a conflict of authority on the point as to whether an appeal is competent under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act against orders made under Sections 24, 25 and other similar sections of the Hindu Marriage Act, the preponderance of view as expressed by the Punjab, Calcutta, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Madras High Courts is that such an appeal is competent. After giving the matter my earnest consideration I agree with the above view because the effect of taking an opposite view would be that no appeal would be maintainable even against the decrees granted in proceedings under Sections 9 to 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Those decrees would not answer to the definition of the term ""decree"" as given in the Code of Civil Procedure. Decrees under that Code are granted in regular suits, instituted by the filing of plaints and not by the filing of petitions. The language of Section 28 also makes it clear that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act are not decrees under the Code of Civil Procedure, for it is stated therein that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act shall be enforced in like manner as decrees of a Court on its original civil jurisdiction. This necessarily implies that though the decrees under the Act are by a statutory fiction treated for the purpose of enforcement as decrees under the Code, they in fact are not such decrees. It was also not the intention of the Legislature in my view while giving a right of appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, to make that right indefinite and more or less illusory by providing that the appeal under that section would be competent only if a provision for that purpose exists in some other law in force for the time being and not otherwise. Section 28 should be regarded as self-contained so far as appeals against decrees and orders under the different provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act are concerned and for this purpose it should not be necessary to look to other laws. The words in Section 28 ""and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"", as I read that section, have reference only to the forum of appeal and the procedure to govern such appeals.",['28']
66,"I, therefore, agree with the view that the orders under Sections 24, 25 and other similar sections of the Hindu Marriage Act are appealable under Section 28 of the Act. This would not, however, solve our difficulty in the present case because the question with which we are concerned is whether an order made on an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act is appealable under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In this connection I am of the view that the appeals contemplated by Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act are against the decrees and orders made under the specified provisions of that Act. Where, however an order is made on an application under the Code of Civil Procedure and not on an application under some provision of the Hindu Marriage Act even though it be in the course of proceedings under that Act, the question as to whether the order is appealable or not would have to be answered by reference to the provisions of the Code. The reason for that is that Section 21 of the Act makes the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act and if an application is made during the course of those proceedings under the Code it is to that Code that we shall have to look to determine as to whether the order made under the Code is appealable or not. It is not the effect of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act that even though an order on an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure be not appealable, an appeal against it would be competent if it is made in the course of proceedings under that Act The only effect of Section 28, in my view, is to give a right of appeal to an aggrieved party against decrees and orders for which an express provision is made under the Hindu Marriage Act, and it would not be a correct construction of the section to hold that it enlarges the right of appeal and makes appeals competent even against those orders under the Code of Civil Procedure which are otherwise not appealable. No authority has been cited at the bar in support of the view that an order, not made under some express provision of the Hindu Marriage Act but on an application made under the Code of Civil Procedure in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, would be appealable even though the Code gives no right of appeal against such an order. On the contrary I find that there are authorities which fortify me in the view I am taking of the matter.",['28']
67,"There are a number of authorities in support of the view we are taking, but we have so long been considering the question on principles as, in our view, and this we say with due respect, none of the aforesaid authorities has considered the question in such depth or details as we have had to do here in this case, and, in particular, the question does not appear to have been considered in any of those decisions with proper advertence to the Long Tide and in the context of the various other provisions of the Limitation Act To start with, the Full Bench decision of this Court in Debi Bhaduri v. Kumarjib Bhaduri, cannot be taken to have decided the question because the question which concerned and was decided by the Full Bench was whether the shorter period of limitation prescribed by Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as amended by the Amendment Act, 1976, would apply to any appeal arising out of a proceeding pending on the date of the commencement of the aforesaid amendment Act The Full Bench answered the question in the affirmative and as a result the appeal in that case was to be taken to have been filed beyond the period of Limitation. It was in that context that the Full Bench, while returning the case back to the Division Bench which made the reference, observed (at paragraphs 17 and 22) that the appeal being thus barred by limitation, an application for extension under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was to be dealt with and disposed of by the Division Bench and that the decision of the Full Bench on the question of limitation ""would not affect or prejudice the rights, if any, of the appellant to make an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act"". This is, therefore, obviously no decision or declaration of law on the question as to whether the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to matrimonial appeals under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act in view of Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act.","['5','28']"
68,"Mr. Sawant, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner husband raised only one contention. He submitted that the marriage of the respondent with the petitioner is null and void in view of the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and such a marriage, therefore, cannot confer the status of wife on the respondent which would entitle her to make an application for maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submitted that in order that a woman may be entitled to claim maintenance under the said provisions, she must satisfy the conditions laid down in that section, one of the conditions being that she is the wife of the person against whom maintenance is claimed. According to him, the word ""wife"" in section 125 must mean, and has all along been construed to mean under section 488 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure, ""a legally wedded wife"", and as such a woman whose marriage contravenes the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act being void cannot claim the status of a wife. The mere fact that the necessary ceremonies of a marriage under the customary Hindu Law have been gone into cannot confer on her the status of ""a legally wedded wife' which is a condition precedent for claiming maintenance under section 125 of the Code.","['11','5']"
69,"As per Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, any marriage solemnized in violation of Clause (i) (iv) and (v) of section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act is void and the same may be declared by a decree of nullity, whereas under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a voidable marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity. The different expressions used in these two provisions cannot go unnoticed. So far as Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act is concerned, the marriage is not annulled and is only declared as void by a decree of nullity. Thus, what is done by the court is only a declaration and not annulment of marriage. But, under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, since the marriage is not void ab initio, the same requires to be annulled by a decree of nullity. Here, it is not declaration but a positive act of annulment of the marriage by a decree of nullity. Similarly, under Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act also, the court annuls the marriage by a decree of nullity. Thus, Section 12 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 3(1) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act are in pari materia. Therefore, unless there is a positive decree passed by the competent court annulling the child marriage, the marriage shall be subsisting.","['11','12']"
70,"Crl.R.C.No.806 of 2019 not allow him to touch her. Thus, both the parties are throwing blame against each other for non-consummation of their marriage. Therefore, without entering into any controversy to find out as to who is at fault for non- consummation of their marriage, it is suffice to hold that the fact that remains established in this case is that their marriage is not consummated. It is a matter of record that the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act against the respondent to annul their marriage by a decree of nullity on the ground that the respondent is impotent was allowed and a decree of nullity of the said marriage to that effect was passed. The said decree also became final as the respondent did not question the same in the Higher Forum. Therefore, the fact that remains established in this case is that the said marriage was annulled by a decree of nullity passed by a competent court of law under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that the respondent is impotent.",['12']
71,"In this connection, I may refer to Boodapati Ankamma v. Boodapati Bamanappa AIR 1927 Mad 332, in which Vardachariar, J. has observed at page 334 that a Hindu Marriage is a sacrament and not a civil contract and that it will not be permissible to apply to a Hindu marriage all the principles of the Law of Contract. Similarly, in Harbhajan Singh v. Smt. Brij Balab Kaur, Air 1964 Punj 359, which is a case after the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, came into force, the Punjab High Court has said that the word ""fraud"" is not used in Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act in a general way and on every misrepresentation or concealment, the marriage cannot be dissolved. If the term ""fraud"" is to be interpreted according to the definition given in the Indian Contract Act, then it would become impossible to maintain the sanctity of the marriage. All sorts of misrepresentations will be alleged by the petitioners in order to break the marriage tie. This obviously could not be the intention of the legislature. In Anath Nath De v. Lajjabati Devi, also, the case was under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and S. Datta, J., who delivered the judgment, has observed at page 779 that the marriage according to Hindu law not being a contract, the consent at the stage of negotiations though obtained by fraud cannot affect the validity of the marriage. It is true that in that case no fraud was alleged at the time of the solemnization of the marriage and, therefore, the petitioner could not be granted any relief. But at the same time, the case was decided on the footing that even under the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage is a sacrament and not a civil contract. My attention is also drawn to the provisions of Section 19 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869.",['12']
72,"In the instant case, the appellant husband was married to the respondent wife on 22nd June, 1985, according to Hindu rites. On account of differences between them, they took a decision to obtain a decree of mutual divorce, which resulted in the filing of a joint petition for divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') on 4th September, 2004, in the District Court at Chhindwara. The same was registered as Civil Suit No.167-A of 2004. As required under the provisions of Section 13-B of the aforesaid Act, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, fixed the date for consideration of the petition after six months so as to give the parties time to reconsider their decision. On 7th March, 2005, after the expiry of six months, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, took up the matter in the presence of both the parties who were present in the Court. While the appellant husband reiterated his earlier stand that a decree of mutual divorce should be passed on account of the fact that it was not possible for the parties to live together, on behalf of the respondent wife it was submitted that despite serious differences which had arisen between them, she did not want the marriage ties to be dissolved. On account of withdrawal of consent by the respondent wife, the learned Judge dismissed the joint petition under Section 13-B of the Act.",['13-B']
73,"In Prabir Chandra Chatterjee case (supra), a matrimonial proceeding was initiated by the wife by a petition of divorce of her marriage with her husband on various grounds like cruelty, adultery, etc. The petition for divorce was labelled as one both under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and the reason for the same appeared to be that the marriage between the parties were first solemnized according to Hindu rites under the Hindu Marriage Act and was thereafter registered as well under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. Their Lordships of the Calcutta High Court held that if the marriage of the wife with the husband, though celebrated and solemnized according to Hindu rites, was thereafter duly registered under Chapter III of the Special Marriage Act, the ongoing matrimonial proceeding should be governed by Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and not by Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. And in that case, labelling the petition under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act as one ""under Section 13, Hindu Marriage Act"" also was useless surplusage, which, at any rate, could not affect the maintainability or merit of the petition for divorce, nor the jurisdiction of the Court to grant divorce, if any case, therefore, was eventually made out at the trial.",['13']
74,"We have already pointed out that the respondent husband had presented his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act within a period of little more than six months from the date of marriage. On 3rd March, 1976 their marriage took place and the following day the petitioner and the respondent wife had come to the former's residence at 47, Rajani Mukherjee Lane, Behala. The petitioner had pleaded that on 5th March, 1976 when the Boubhat ceremony was performed it appeared that Smritikatna had mental infirmity. According to the petitioner, she was found completely of unsound mind and became extremely aggressive and violent in nature. As already staled, that the alleged particulars of such mental disorder of the respondent were sought to be given by amending the petition under Section 13 of the Act. The petitioner husband claimed that on 11th March, 1976. Dr. A. Chakraborty, a psychiatrist, had examined her and had prescribed medicines. But she had continued to suffer from mental disorder. On 14th April, 1977 the husband got his wife Smritikana examined by Dr. D. N. Nandi, who was described as an eminent psychologist. According to the petitioner, as his relations were left with no peace by us wife, he had hired a flat at Tollygunge Circular Road and took her there on 19th of April, 1976. On 27th May, 1976, the petitioner's father-in-law had visited him and she had abused him and he had fainted and had to be removed to a hospital. Being unable to bear, the husband claimed to have sent his wife to his father-in-law's house, on 11th July, 1976 on return from his office, the petitioner found the respondent in the house. She continued to abuse and misbehave. With the help of Sri Madan Mondal, the petitioner got her admitted in the Hospital for Mental Diseases at Gobra on 14th of July, 1976. While she was still an indoor patient in the said hospital, on 21st Sept., 1976 the present husband had filed the petition under Section 12 and in the alternative under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. As already stated, he did not either plead or prove his exceptional hardship or depravity on the part of his wife. His original petition did not give particulars of the alleged mental illness of his wife, Smritikana. No doubt, he had filed his petition for amendment after expiry of more than one year from the date of the marriage. But he did not thereby plead or thereafter prove by evidence that even after expiry of the period of one year, the respondent wife had continued to be either incurably of unsound mind or that she was still suffering from mental disorder of such a kind and such an extent that the petitioner could not be reasonably expected to live with the respondent. The petitioner had amended his petition by only giving particulars of her alleged mental disorder between 4th of March, 1976 and 14th of July, 1976. He did not even wait for completion of his wife's treatment in the Hospital for Mental Diseases, Gobra.",['13']
75,"From the abovequoted order dated 30.11.1991 it does not appear that while disposing of the application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court had regard to the question whether there was a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage. However, it appears from the records that lateron attempts were made for reconciliation but proved futile. Admittedly the husband filed a petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground that the wife has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the husband with cruelty.",['14']

Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh also found that the Apex Court decision in the case of Smt. Sureshta Devi (Supra) was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge during the course of hearing in Pooja Gupta's case (Supra) and therefore, the said judgment ignoring the decision of the Apex Court would have no binding effect.","['14','13-B']"
77,"Mr. Basu's more formidable contention is that Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in view of its Section 29(4), has no application to a marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Elaborating his arguments. Mr. Basu contended that the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act are complete codes in themselves, containing elaborate provisions regarding conditions of marriage, respective rights of parties as also judicial processes in connection therewith. It would not be permissible to import provisions of one statute to the other and in fact by Section 29(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act it is provided that nothing in the said Act shall affect the provisions in the Special Marriage Act with respect to marriages between Hindus solemnised under that Act If Section 15 of Hindu Marriage Act had thus no application, the marriage could not be impugned in law. Mr. Mitra has disputed the above contentions as, according to him, the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act shall, under its Section 29(4). affect only the provisions of marriage under the Special Marriage Act and nothing beyond,",['15']
78,"However, Mr.Pramod Swarup, the learned counsel for the appellant-husband, vehemently submitted that having regard to the fact that both the parties have drifted from married life the marriage must be taken as irretrievably broken, more so because the husband has remarried and has a child through the second marriage and, therefore, this Court should grant a divorce. We do not think that in the facts and circumstances of the case such a view can be taken. From the very beginning the wife has been saying that she is ready and willing to live with the husband. It is the husband who is denying her access. If the husband remarried in hot haste after the institution of the second appeal which was delayed by only three days, we cannot see how that fact can come to his rescue. That is clearly opposed to Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act which in terms states that when a marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce and there is no right of appeal against the decree or where there is such a right, the time for filing an appeal has expired or an appeal has been presented and has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to remarry. In the instant case no doubt the second appeal was delayed by three days but the fact is that it was instituted and was pending on the date of the second marriage. Therefore, the husband acted in disregard of Section 15 and cannot get the benefit of his own wrong""",['15']
79,"Hanmanta v. Dhondavvabai, is a single judge decision of the Bombay High Court. The facts of that decision are very peculiar. There, the legitimate son filed a suit for partition against the father and the father claimed that his illegitimate son born to the second wife, with whom his marriage is void, is also entitled to a share. In such a context, the court held that in spite of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a child of a void marriage is riot entitled to a share in property of which father is a coparcener. This decision does not discuss either the textual Hindu law or the decisions which dealt with the rights of the illegitimate son of Sudra. The court did not also indicate whether by virtue of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act (unamended Section 16), the illegitimate son got any rights to the property. With utmost respect to the learned judge, we are unable to follow this decision for two reasons: (1) the court did not consider the effect of Section 16 on the rights of an illegitimate son. It did not go into the question whether the status of legitimate son conferred by Section 16 has enlarged his rights; (2) the decision makes observations which are contrary to the principles laid down in Gur Narain v. Gur Tahal Das, (supra) and Ajit Kumar v. Ujayar Singh, (supra).",['16']
80,"Sri Krishna Bhat, learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that even though the marriage of the 1st defendant with the 2nd defendant had taken place in 1967 after the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act and as per the amendment effected to Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'), by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Central Act 68 of 1976), even if the marriage of the 2nd defendant with the 1st defendant is held to be null and void, the issues born out of such wed-lock are legitimate issues and are entitled to a share in the property of the joint family of which the 1st defendant is a member. In support of this submission, learned Counsel has placed reliance on a decision of the High Court of Madras in MARGABANDHU AND ANR. v. KOTHANDARAMA MANDHIRI AND ORS 1983(2) Madras Law Journal 445. On the contrary, it is submitted by Sri T.S. Ramachandra, learned Counsel for the respondents 1 to 4 and 6 that the decision in Margabandhu's case has not noticed the specific words contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Act which are to the effect that no rights are conferred upon any child born out of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled under Section 12 of the Act in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Therefore, it is contended that no right is conferred upon such child, in the coparcenary property in as much as coparcenary property cannot be held to be the exclusive property of the parents until the partition takes place between them and the legitimate sons and a particular specific property of the joint family is allotted to their share. Learned Counsel, however, submitted that they are entitled to a share only in the separate and self-acquired property of their parents and not in the coparcenary property. In support of this submission, learned Counsel has placed reliance on a Division Bench decision of the High Court of Bombay in SHANTARAM TUKARAM PATIL AND ANR. v. SMT.

81,"It would thus be seen that the Court would take cognizance of an offence punishable under Chapter XX of the Code only upon a complaint made by any of the persons specified in this Section . According to Clause (c) of the Proviso to Sub-section (1), a complaint for the offence under Section 494 or 495 can be made by the wife or on her behalf by her father, mother, brother, sister, son or daughter or by her father's or mother's brother or sister. Such complaint may also be filed, with the leave of the Court, by any other person related to the wife by blood, marriage or adoption. If a Hindu wife files a complaint for the offence under Section 494 on the ground that during the subsistence of the marriage, her husband had married a second wife under some other religion after converting to that religion, the offence of bigamy pleaded by her would have to be investigated and tried in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is under this Act that it has to be seen whether the husband, who was married a second wife, has committed the offence of bigamy or not. Since under the Hindu Marriage Act, a bigamous marriage is prohibited and has been constituted as an offence under Section 17 of the Act, any marriage solemnized by the husband during the subsistence of that marriage, in spite of his conversion to another religion, would be an offence triable under Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 494 IPC. Since taking of cognizance of the offence under Section 494 is limited to the complaints made by the persons specified in Section 198 of the CrPC, it is obvious that the person making the complaint would have to be decided in terms of the personal law applicable to the complainant and the respondent (accused) as mere conversion does not dissolve the marriage automatically and they continue to be ""husband and wife"".",['17']
82,"It was thus pointed out by this Court that Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act requires that the marriage must be properly solemnized in the sense that the necessary ceremonies required by law or by custom must be duly performed. Once these ceremonies are proved to have been performed the marriage become properly solemnized and if contracted while the first marriage is still subsisting the provisions of Section 494 will apply automatically. In a decision of this Court in Kanwal Ram & Ors. v. The Himachal Pradesh Administration the earlier case was noticed by the Court and relied upon. The matter has also been fully discussed in Priya Bala Ghosh v. Suresh Chandra Ghosh. In view of the authorities of this Court, therefore, the following position emerges: where a spouse contracts a second marriage while the first marriage is still subsisting the spouse would be guilty of bigamy under Section 494 if it is proved that the second marriage was a valid one in the sense that the necessary ceremonies required by law or by custom have been actually performed. The voidness of the marriage under Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act is in fact one of the essential ingredients of Section 494 because the second marriage will become void only because of the provisions of Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In these circumstances, therefore, we are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Mulla that the second marriage being void Section 494 will have no application. It was next contended by Mr. Mulla that there is no legal evidence to show that the second marriage which is said to be a nata marriage was actually performed. We are afraid, we are unable to go into this question because three courts have concurrently found as a fact that the parties were governed by custom of nata marriage and the two essential ceremonies of this marriage are:",['17']

"" It then noted that the appellant was unable to cite any authority to justify the claim of second wife and answered the question without any further discussion stating that ""the legal position is almost settled that since the second marriage during subsistence of first one is void, the second wife does not get any rights as regards the maintenance. As a result, I hold that the respondent being the second wife of the petitioner is not *5* FCA-117/2006 entitled to any maintenance allowance.""

Though we shall take note of these questions at a later and more appropriate stage, we would like to point out at the outset that the issues raised can be put in two compartments, viz., (i) what is the status of marriage under Hindu Law when one of the parties to the marriage is below the age of 18 years prescribed under Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Section 2 (a) of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred as the âPCM Actâ) and (ii) when the girl is minor (but the boy has attained the age of marriage as prescribed) whether the husband he can be regarded as the lawful guardian of the minor wife and claim her custody in spite of contest and claim by the parents of the girl.

85,"The amplitude of the term 'mental cruelty' in connection with the Section 13(1)(ia)~HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955~^ of the Hindu Marriage Act has been very exhaustively considered in the celebrated decision of the Supreme Court in V. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat, . Before 1976 amendment cruelty was not a ground of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. It was however at that time only a ground for judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. But there also the ground was not simple cruelty but it was such cruelty 'as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party'. By the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 cruelty has been made aground of divorce under Section 13(1)(ia)~HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955~^ of the Hindu Marriage Act wherein the language used is that the other party 'has after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty' and that is also now a ground of judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The concept that the conduct amounting to mental cruelty must be of such nature as will or is likely to cause injury to life, limb or health of the other spouse is however not the law in India at present as will appear from the said decision of V. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat . There in paragraph 13/14 the Supreme Court referred to certain English Decisions and observed that the reference to 'injury to life, limb or health' in the concerned passages must be understood in the context of the requirements of the divorce law then obtaining in the United Kingdom. In paragraph 14/15 of the said decision in V. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat AIR 1994 SC 710 (supra) the Supreme Court took note of the change of law brought about in the Hindu Marriage Act by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 and observed thus in the context of cruelty :--","['13-A','10']"
86,"Now that we have found that mental cruelty has been established against the wife by reason of her making baseless allegation in the written statement and during evidence that there is illicit connection of the husband with another woman, the question arises as to what relief should be granted to the petitioner for that reason. In this connection we are also to record that there is nothing which would debar the grant of relief in this case under Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act. But even then the question remains as to whay relief should be granted ?",['23']
87,"Cruelty is a ground under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, both for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia)~HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955~^ and for judicial separation under Section 10(1). Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides that in any proceeding under the said Act on a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce, except in certain cases mentioned therein, the Court may if it considers it just so to do having regard to the circumstances of the case, pass instead a decree for judicial separation.","['13','10']"
88,"It may be mentioned here that the exceptions mentioned in that section are not attracted in this case and as such in a case like this where mental cruelty has been established the Court can yet consider under Section 13A of the Hindu Marriage Act whether instead of granting divorce on the ground of cruelty a decree for judicial separation should be passed, having regard to the circumstances of the case. Having regard to the fact that the grounds of desertion and cruelty as originally pleaded in the petition filed by the husband could not be established, as discussed in this judgment, and having regard to the fact that earlier the parties could settle their bickerings by effecting a compromise leading to burial of earlier litigations and to the fact that the parties have a daughter of adolescent age we think that it would be just to pass a decree of judicial separation instead of a decree for dissolution of marriage so that the door for reconciliation between the parties in the changed circumstances may remain open for sometime more, as it does not appear to us to be a case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.",['13-A']
89,"Therefore with a hope that the parties may even hereafter effect amicable reconciliation we would grant a decree of judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act instead of a decree of dissolution of marriage under Section 13(1)(ia)~HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955~^ of the Hindu Marriage Act. Accordingly we set aside the impugned judgment and order of the learned trial Court and dispose of the suit filed by the petitioner-husband by granting a decree of judicial separation under Section 10(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act instead of a decree of divorce.

One of the grounds for challenging the maintenance order was that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent/wife was solemnized and duly registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 and the learned District Judge had no inherent jurisdiction to entertain and proceed with the divorce petition filed by the respondent under Section 13 (1) (i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and therefore, the application under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act which was for permanent alimony which is to be granted at the time of divorce was itself not maintainable.","['20','13-A','25']"

It was in this background that the Hon'ble High Court had observed that the order with regard to grant of maintenance by the learned District Judge, Shillong had not committed any illegality or impropriety in passing the order of maintenance.

The words which have been incorporated are ""as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party"".

107,"In this connection, we find that Christian spouses alone are not entitled to get dissolution of their marriage on the ground of cruelty and desertion even if perpetrated continuously for any length of time. They are entitled to get only a decree for judicial separation under Section 22 of the Act.",['22']
108,"Then again. Section 27(2) of the Special Marriage Act and Section 13(1A) of the Hindu Marriage Act providing for divorce on the ground of non-resumption of cohabitation for a period of one year or more after the passing of a decree for judicial separation or for restitution of conjugal rights have, in a sense recognised the concept of breakdown of marriage, the rationale behind those provisions being the presumption that non-resumption of cohabitation for the requisite period demonstrates breakdown of the marriage beyond repair.","['27','13-A']"
109,"It is true that both Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act and Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act provide for divorce by mutual consent where the parties have been living separately for at least one year and that they have not been able to live together. This again without doubt has brought in the concept of breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce. But there again, the breakdown, by itself, has not been made a ground of dissolution, but what would warrant such a dissolution are the parties failing to live together and living separately for one year and their mutual consent to dissolve the marriage.","['28','13-B']"
110,"Section 23(1)(e) of the Hindu Marriage Act, does not specifically provide that decrees can be granted on those grounds only ""but not otherwise"", and if in spite of the absence of such negative prohibition, the ratio in Reynold Rajamani (supra) is that no divorce can be granted except on grounds expressly specified, the ratio will a fortiori apply to divorces under the Special Marriage Act or the Hindu Marriage Act where such negative provisions stare at the face.",['23']
111,"Section 10(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it stood before the amendment of 1976, permitted a party to a marriage to present a petition praying for a decree for judicial separation on that ground that the other party ""has treated the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party.""",['10']
112,"The difference in the language relating to the ground cruelty as it was in section 10 prior to the amendment of 1976 and now in section 13 after the amendment is too striking to be missed even by casual observer. The difference in the language of the provision prior the amendment of 1976 and the provision after the amendment of 1976 has led to considerable debate before me in this appeal. At this stage I may mention that after the Hindu Marriage Act was amended in 1976, the appellant amended his petition by substituting the prayer for divorce in place of an original prayer for judicial separation. This was the only amendment which was made by the appellant in his petition before the trial Court after the amendment of the Hindu Marriage Act in 1976.","['10','13']"
113,"his decision survey's the relevant authorities of the Supreme Court upto that date and also refers to the provisions of section 25(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act. In that case a question had arisen as to the standard of proof required for substantiating the charge of unchastity. It was held that in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dr. N.G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane, , the burden of proving matrimonal offences was no higher than in civil proceedings, that is, a fact can be established if it is proved by preponderance of probability. The learned trial Judge was in error in making a distinction between a case for judicial separation and a case for divorce, because the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Dastane v. Dastane does not make any such distinction and secondly section 25(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act itself does not make any such distinction. On the question of the burden of proof, therefore, one must proceed on the basis that the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Dastane v. Dastane is the last word.",['25']
114,"The petition for divorce was filed primarily on the ground of cruelty. It may be pertinent to note that, prior to 1976 amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 cruelly was not a ground for claiming divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. It was only a ground for claiming judicial separation under Section 10 of the Act. By the 1976 amendment, cruelty was made a ground for divorce and the words which have been omitted from Section 10 are ""as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party"". Therefore, it is not necessary for a party claiming divorce to prove that the cruel treatment is of such a nature as to cause an apprehension-reasonable apprehension - that it will be harmful or injurious for him or her to live with the other party.""",['10']

116,"If the mandatory minimum period of separate residence of one year is sufficient for those to whom the secular law of divorce by mutual consent under Sec.28 of the Special Marriage Act, and Hindus to whom Sec.13B of the Hindu Marriage Act and Parsis to whom Sec.32B of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, there is no justification constitutionally acceptable for insisting on a different longer period of mandatory minimum separate residence so far as the Christians to whom Sec.10A of the Divorce Act applies, contend counsel. The learned counsel urge that the stipulation is unconstitutional as it offends the mandate of equality under Art.14 of the Constitution.",['28']
117,"In this context it will be apposite to look at the rationale behind the stipulation of a period of mandatory minimum separate residence. The law and the system values and cherishes the institution of matrimony. The concept of marriage being sublime is accepted by the refined polity. Though the polity and State does not look at marriage as purely a divine sacrament it accepts marriage to be the most fundamental and sublime of all human institutions. Marriage is an arrangement/institution between the adult partners which has social and societal implications. Even when the concept of divorce by mutual consent is accepted, the system wants to ensure that a decision to dissolve marriage by mutual consent is taken by the partners only after sufficient forethought. The spouses must decide mutually that the marriage can be dissolved by their mutual consent. They must be satisfied that they are not able to live together. They must actually have been unable to live together and such period of separate residence must be a  prescribed mandatory minimum. All this is made only to ensure that a decision to dissolve marriage is not taken hastily and without sufficient forethought or contemplation. This anxiety of law is reflected in Sec.28(2) of the Special Marriage Act, Sec.13B (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Sec.10A(2) of the Divorce Act.","['28','13-B','10']"
118,"The brief facts leading to this litigation are that the petitioner was married to the respondent on 22nd February 1961 in Nagpur according to Hindu Vedic rites. On 26th June 1964 the respondent filed in the Court of the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division Nagpur, a petition for judicial separation inter alia under Section 10(1)(a) and (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the grounds of desertion and cruelty. On 12th January 1965 a decree for judicial separation was passed in favour of the respondent. There are fortunately no children of the marriage.",['10']

Thus, we find that in regard to the grounds allowed by law for dissolution of marriage, there is a discriminatory treatment meted out to Christan spouses.",['22']
121,"The English Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, by Section 7 conferred jurisdiction for the first time on the Courts to give judicial separation but not the divorce a mensa et thoro: but a decree of judicial separation had the same effect and same consequences as a decree by way of divorce mensa et thoro. Thus the term 'judicial separation' came to be used for denoting a limited kind of divorce i.e. separation from bed and board thereby putting and end to notice that in India also the remedy of judicial separation was made available to the Christians by the Indian Divorce Act No. IV of 1369.",['7']
122,The Letters Patent Appeal in this cases raises a question of divorce law of considerable importance. The matter concerns the interpretation of Section 13(1A) as well as of Section 23 of the Act and the question raised are such that they are likely to affect a fairly substantial segment of modern Hindu Society.,"['13-A','23']"
123,"""Under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court may grant divorce either on account of a specified matrimonial offence a disease or a party to the marriage not being heard of for a period of seven years, which may be due to no fault of his as where he might be a prisoner of war. The matrimonial offence for which divorce may be granted are habitual living in adultery, conversion to another religion or renunciation of the word, such as entering into Sanyasa. The last three would be acts of volition of a party to the marriage and may conveniently be called matrimonial offences.",['13']
124,"Proceeding on this basis that this was the state of the law governing Hindus prior to the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, and on the basis that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, more or less follows Section 37 of me Indian Divorce Act 1869, the learned Judge finally comes to the conclusion that on the basis of the English authorities referred to by him, the wife though unchaste, is entitled to a bare subsistence allowance or starving allowance. No doubt the learned Judge also states that if such a wife is earning a living and is not in a helpless position, her right to maintenance even of the bare subsistence disappears, because the learned Judge emphasises that the allowance is meant to prevent 'starvation'. On this basis, the learned Judge ultimately directed payment of alimony at the sum mentioned in his order.",['25']
125,"Section 4 categorically states that the Act, except as otherwise provided for overrides any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act. Therefore it will be seen that so far as claims are made under the Act, rights of parties will have to be adjudicated upon the basis of the provisions contained in the statute itself.",['4']
126,"The Court accepted the allegations made against the wife and ultimately granted divorce. The wife made an application for the grant of maintenance under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. That claim was opposed by the husband on the ground that inasmuch as the wife was bound by the Court, to be leading an adulterous life, she is not entitled to any maintenance at all.",['25']
127,"After referring to Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the learned Judges express the view that Sub-section (2) of Section 25 no doubt prima facie does not place any such limitation as urged on behalf of the husband. But the learned Judges emphasise that Sub-section (3) of Section 25 clearly gives an indication supporting the contention of the husband.",['25']
128,"The learned Judges, after reference to the provisions contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, Act 78/56, ultimately observed that unchastiy on the part of a woman, as well as sexual intercourse of a man with a woman outside wedlock arc sins against the ethics of matrimonial morality in this country.",['18']
129,Then the only question remained was that whether the husband was taking advantage of his own wrong as contemplated by S. 23(1)(a). This was also negatived by observing as mentioned above. Again in this case facts and circumstances show that there was no conduct amounting to 'wrong' committed by the husband to disentitle him to decree of divorce.,['23']
130,Accordingly we hold that the marriage between the parties were held and solemnised in Brahmo form on 28.5.1970 as alleged by the appellant. Such a marriage could be registered under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act. But Ext. C purports to suggest that the marriage was solemnised and registered under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. There cannot be two valid marriages between the same parties. It is clear from the evidence on record that the marriage between the parties was solemnised for the first time under Brahmo form. In that view of the matter the marriage certificate given under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act is redundant and should be ignored. If at all it is to be relied upon it should be treated as registration of the Brahmo marriage under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act.,['15']
131,"The said Prasad Roy has not however, been examined by the husband/ respondent, Ext. C is the certificate of marriage issued under Section 13 of the Special Marriage Act dated 28.5.1970 and there are three witnesses. But none of them has been examined by the respondent to show that the marriage registered under Ext. C was solemnised under the provisions of the said Act and not under Brahmo rites. The learned trial Judge has disbelieved the story of Brahmo ceremonial marriage between the parties on the ground that the petitioner has not been corroborated by any other witness. But it appears that the appellant has examined one Prasanta Kumar Bhattacharjee P.W. 3 who is a co-tenant in the premises where the father and other family members of the petitioner resided at Baranagar.",['13']
132,Divorce under Hindu Marriage Act can only be given on any of the ground under Section 13. Allowing divorce on any other ground not mentioned in Section 13 would be an act without any sanction of law. Such power is only with the apex Court under Article 142. We are afraid we can not go beyond the law. So long the ground of irretrievable break down of marriage is not made a ground under Section 13 such ground by itself can not be a ground for divorce. With deepest respect to Their Lordships we are constrained to hold that two Division Bench decisions in the case of Sukhomoy Bag in our view do not lay down the correct law. However same Division Bench has modified its stand in the later decision that Sukhendu v. Anjali (supra).,['13']
133,The decree for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act is available on proof of any of the ground mentioned in Section 13 of the said Act or by a mutual decree under Section 13B thereof. Since there is no such ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage under Section 13 the appellant is not entitled to pray for decree of divorce on the said ground.,"['13','13-B']"
134,"Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act only declares that it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again under certain circumstances. From this it does not follow that a right to remarry enures automatically after the expiry of 30 days from the date of the decree of divorce. If an appeal is presented, one will have to wait till it is dismissed. If there is a right of appeal, the time for filing the appeal should have expired without the appeal being filed, taking into consideration the time required for obtaining the certified copy.",['15']

All that we have said hereinbefore is that we can not decree divorce solely on the basis of compromise unless we are also satisfied that a ground for divorce specified in the Statute can be traced on the record In the case at hand it is on record that the parties have fought with severest bellicosity in the Courts below for about two years, the charge of the husband being mental disorder of the wife and that of the wife being cruelty and physical tenure by the husband. Having lost at the first bout in the trial Court, the husband has filed this appeal and the parties were contesting the same with all severity for about two years in this Court.",['21']
137,"If we read Section 19 of the Divorce Act in comparison with Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, we find that under the Hindu Marriage Act even lesser mental disorders and mental illnesses are made a ground for divorce, while the Indian Divorce Act insists upon a much stricter standard of a party being a lunatic or idiot at the time of the marriage. This difference in the language of the two statutes contemplates a much more stricter proof and proof of a greater mental disorder than the one which would suffice for obtaining a decree for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. Abraham Jacob v, Usha K. Mamrnan, 1984 Ker LJ 593 : (AIR 1985 NOC 217) is a decision by one of us, P. C. Bala-krishna Menon, J. dealing with Section 19(3) of the Indian Divorce Act. His Lordship observed that lunatic or idiot is not defined in the Act, but the definition given to the term 'lunatic' in Section 3(5) of the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 is adopted by the Indian Divorce Act.",['19']
138,"With regard to a marriage performed according to Arya Samaj Rites the position was not altogether clear. In Dr. Niranjan Das Mohan v. Mrs. Ena Mohan and others Air 1943 Calcutta 145(9), a decree of dissolution was granted under the Indian Divorce Act in respect of such a marriage because it was found as a fact on the evidence produced in the case 'that an Arya Samaj marriage is monogamous' Therefore, it was held that section 7 did not bar relief.",['7']
139,"Neither of the other two judges forming the Full Bench said anything in support of that view, and it seems untenable having reward to the proviso to section 7 and the fact that section 2 requires onlv one party to be a Christian. Nor have I been shown any other authority expressing a like opinion.","['7','2']"
140,"However, the whole position has been radically alrered by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, which, by scction 2(a), applies to Arya Samajists. A Hindu marriage has now been rendered monogamous by that Act, as section 5 makes it a condition that 'neither party his a spouse living at the time of the marriage'.","['2','5']"
141,"The bar to relief emanat ing from English law by virtue of section 7 of the Indian Divorce Act no longer operates. Relief can now be had under that Act in respect of a Hindu marriage provided, of course, one of the parties professes the Christian religion when the petititn is filed. That condition,-as I have already said, is fulfillled in this case.",['7']
142,"On the other hand, the plea that has been raised by the petitioner is that the respondent insisted him to get separated from the joint family and to have separate mess. Both the pleas are inconsistent to each other. The attitude of the petitioner in raising inconsistent pleas and not caring to maintain her since 1966 and not even filing an application under S. 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act clearly demonstrates that what has been pleaded by him is not correct and his contention that the respondent is living in adultery has to be rejected.",['9']

He did not plead any case of exceptional hardship to him or of exceptional depravity on the part of his wife. Therefore, it is patent that on the date of the presentation of the said petition, the Court below was not competent to entertain the respondent husband's petition for dissolution of his marriage with the appellant by a decree of divorce. But the said bar under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not apply to the respondent's petition for annulling the marriage under Section 12(1) of the said Act. It is somewhat strange that none of the parties had drawn the attention of the Court below to the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and overlooking the said provisions, the Court below has dissolved by a decree of divorce the marriage between the appellant and the respondent.",['14']

Jitendra Gandhi), under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Case No.94 of 2011 (Jitendra Gandhi Vs. Smt. Monika Gupta), under Section 9 of the Hindu Marrigate Act. 2. Case No.205 of 2011 was filed by appellant, Smt. Monika Gupta against the defendant/respondent under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for annulling marriage on 15.4.2011 before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jhansi. Case No.94 of 2011 was filed by respondent, Jitendra Gandhi under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights before the Court of Additional Senior Civil Judge at Gandhi Dham (Gujarat). The said case was transferred to the Court of Principal Judge, Family Court at Jhansi by orders of the Supreme Court of India dated, 23.4.2012 passed on Transfer Petition (C) No.166 of 2012. Both the cases were tried together by the Court below and was decided by common order. 3. Plaintiff/appellant filed Case No.205 of 2011 under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for annulling the marriage on the ground that she was married to the defendant/respondent on 12.12.2009 according to Hindu rites and custom at Dabra, District Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh). It was contended that when she was 7 years old, both her parents died, and she was brought up along with her two brothers by her maternal uncle and aunt (Mausa and mausi). It is they who had performed the ceremony of 'Kanyadan' and gave dowry as per their status. It was contended that after marriage, there was constant demand for dowry by the in-laws and appellant was not treated well. For three weeks, she stayed at her in-laws house and, thereafter came to her maternal home along with her brother and after living for 15 days, she again went back to her in-laws house from where her husband took her to Gandhi Dham, Gujarat. 4. In paragraph no.5 of the plaint, it has been specifically stated that at Gandhi Dham (Gujarat), the respondent started pressurising the appellant for sharing bed and having physical relation with his friends, on refusing to do so, she was beaten by her husband. In paragraph 6 of the plaint it is stated that appellant had intimated this to her in laws, but they were not helpful and scolded her saying wife has to obey her husband. It is further stated in paragraph no.8 that she lived at Gandhi Dham till 7.11.2010 and, thereafter, she returned with her brother to her maternal home at Jhansi. 5. The said case was contested by the defendant/respondent by filing his written statement and in the additional pleas, it was stated that the appellant did not want to live at Gandhi Dham and was forcing the respondent to live at Jhansi. It was further averred that appellant and her two brothers are not in control of her maternal uncle and aunt. It is further stated that appellant would quarrel and fight for petty things and she was not interested in doing domestic work and she did not want to live along with family members of the respondent and was always pressurizing him to live separately. It has also been contended that she had been pressurizing the respondent for claiming his share in the family property, consequence of which the parents of the respondent after, giving his share had snapped ties with the respondent and the appellant. It was further stated that the appellant was having extra marital relation with her brother-in-law (Jija).Smt. Monika Gupta vs Jitendra Gandhi on 6 August, 2019 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40706464/ 26. The defendant/respondent filed Case No.94 of 2011 under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, for restitution of conjugal rights before the Additional Senior Civil Judge at Gandhi Dham. In the said case, he made the same allegation that appellant displayed strange behaviour after returning from her parental house. The said case, after being transferred from Gandhi Dham to the Court of Principal Judge, Family Court at Jhansi was contested by the appellant who filed her written statement denying the said facts and reiterated the case set up by her in her case under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the additional pleas. 7. As in both the cases, the parties were same, as such the Principal Judge, Family Court proceeded to decide the same together and following issues were framed :- ""1& D;k ;kph Jherh eksfudk xqIrk dks foi{kh ftrsUnz xa/kh ls vyx jgus dk ;qfDr ;qDr ,oa vkSfpR;iw.kZ vk/kkj gS\ 2& D;k ;kph Jherh eksfudk xqIrk viuh ;kfpdk esa of.kZr rF;ksa ds vk/kkj ij foi{kh ftrsUnz xa/kh ls fookg foPNsn dh vkKfIr izkIr dh vf/kdkfj.kh gS\"" 8. The Court below, thereafter considering the oral and documentary evidence proceeded to hold that appellant has failed to prove her case for cruelty, nor she could prove her case beyond doubt as far as the allegation of sharing bed and making physical relation with other men, the Court below dismissed the case of the appellant under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and allowed the application of the defendant/respondent under Section 9 for the restitution of conjugal rights. Against the order dated 18.1.2016 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jhansi two appeals, First Appeal No.60 2016 filed by the appellant against the order under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act and First Appeal No.61 of 2016 has been preferred against the dismissal of the case under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 9. Both the appeals are being heard and decided together as the same arises out of common order of the Court below. This Court before hearing the case on merits had made an effort for reconciliation between the parties on 25.4.2019, but the effort for reconciliation failed. 10. From the pleadings of the parties and from the perusal of the records of the Court below, the question which emerges for consideration is, (i) whether the appellant is entitled to a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. (ii)Whether there is an irretrievable break down of marriage between the parties. 11. It is contended by the appellant that court below while dealing with the issue failed to record just, cogent and reasonable finding disbelieving the fact of allegation made by the appellant as far as that she was pressurized by defendant/respondent to share bed with friends and colleagues. The Court below should have visualized that lady like appellant whose parents had passed away in her childhood and was brought up by her maternal uncle and aunt and she having no source of livelihood would not make such allegations against her husband which could land her in a dangerous zone unless and until the circumstances compelled her to do so and the Principal Judge, Family Court should not have taken her allegations made in the plaint so lightly and disbelieve forSmt.

The Petitioner and the Respondent No.1 were married to each other according to Hindu rites at Jaipur in the State of Rajasthan on 20th February, 2007. A girl child, Mannat, was born prematurely to the couple on 3rd April, 2008, and had to be kept in incubator for about three weeks. It is the Petitioner's grievance that while they were on their honeymoon in Mauritius, the Respondent No.1, husband, began to treat her with physical and mental cruelty. Even during her pregnancy, she was ill-treated. Ultimately, being unable to withstand the physical and mental cruelty inflicted both on the Petitioner and her minor daughter, the Petitioner was compelled to leave the matrimonial home and return to her parents on 7th October, 2008. 2. On 6th December, 2008, the Respondent No.1, husband, filed an application under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Case No.609 of 2008) against the Petitioner, for restitution of conjugal rights. Unable to bear the shock of the incidents, which had taken place since the Petitioner's marriage with the Respondent No.1, the Petitioner's grandparents suffered heart and paralytic attacks, as a result of which they have become completely bed-ridden. According to the Petitioner, on account of the cruelty meted out to her and the child, the Petitioner filed FIR No.7 of 2009 complaining of offences alleged to have been committed by the Respondent No.1 punishable under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC. 3. It is the Petitioner's further case that in order to settle the matter peacefully, the Petitioner entered into a compromise with the Respondent No.1 on 25th February, 2009, so that she could start her life all over again and to acquire financial independence to provide for herself and for providing proper care to the child on her own. Pursuant to the terms of the compromise, the Petitioner withdrew her complaint under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC, but the Respondent No.1 failed to appear before the Family Court No.2 at Jaipur on 2nd December, 2010, to present a Petition for mutual divorce, as had been agreed upon in the compromise. 4. At this stage, it may be mentioned that on 5th May, 2009, the Petitioner filed a complaint against the Respondent No.1 and his family members under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, hereinafter referred to as `PWD Act') before the Upper Civil Judge (A,B) and Judicial Magistrate Serial No.18 Jaipur City, Jaipur, being Criminal Legal Case No.13 of 2009. Soon, thereafter, on 1st June, 2009, charge-sheet was filed against the Respondent No.1 and his family members in FIR No.7 of 2009 which had been filed by the Petitioner under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC. The next day, on 2nd June, 2009, the Respondent No.1, husband, moved an application under Section 21 of the above Act for visitation rights, which was dismissed by the learned Judge, Family Court.Deepti Bhandari vs Nitin Bhandari & Anr on 14 December, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88924056/ 25. The Respondent No.1 filed Criminal Appeal No.455 of 2009 on 25th August, 2009 against the aforesaid order dated 2nd June, 2009, before the Court of Upper District Judge (Fast Track) No.9, Jaipur City, Jaipur, which dismissed the same. 6. On 18th September, 2009, the Respondent No.1 filed a Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. (S.B. Criminal Misc. Petition No.1977 of 2009) for quashing of the charge-sheet in FIR No.7 of 2009 and further proceedings before the learned Judicial Magistrate-I, No.15, Jaipur City, Jaipur, were stayed therein. On 7th October, 2009, the Respondent No.1 filed another Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. (S.B. Criminal Misc. Petition No.2139 of 2009) for quashing of Criminal Legal Case No.13 of 2009 filed by the Petitioner under Section 12 of the PWD Act, 2005. The High Court also stayed the said proceedings pending before the Upper Civil Judge (A,B) and Judicial Magistrate, Serial No.18, Jaipur City, Jaipur. 7. On 22nd January, 2010, when both the matters came up before the High Court for consideration, the High Court directed the Petitioner and the Respondent No.1 to settle their disputes and to apply for divorce by mutual consent within 15 days. The order was passed in the presence of both the parties. While giving the aforesaid directions, the High Court also passed orders allowing visitation rights to the Respondent No.1, husband, in respect of the minor child. 8. On 17th February, 2010, the Respondent No.1 filed S.B. Criminal Revision Petition No.1 of 2010 before the Jaipur Bench of the Rajasthan High Court against the order dated 25th August, 2009 passed in Criminal Appeal No.455 of 2009 dismissing his application for visitation rights. The Respondent NO.1 also filed Application No.3051 of 2010 in S.B. Criminal Misc. Petition No.1977 of 2009 praying for similar visitation rights. On 8th April, 2010, the said application for visitation rights was allowed and the Petitioner was directed to arrange for the meeting of the Respondent No.1 with the Petitioner and their minor daughter at the office of the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 on every Saturday between 11.00 a.m. and 1.00 p.m. 9. This is the genesis of the problem which is the subject matter of the present Special Leave Petition. 10. According to the Petitioner, on 14th April, 2010, the Petitioner's brother got admission with I.I.P.M. in Delhi, which required him to shift to Delhi for his higher education and the Petitioner also decided to come to Delhi to establish herself professionally to be able to maintain herself and her minor daughter. According to the Petitioner, since then she has been residing in Delhi and the order directing visitation rights to the Respondent No.1 to meet the minor child at Jaipur in the office of the learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 became extremely difficult for her. The Petitioner thereupon moved an application in the High Court on 30th April, 2010, for modification of the order of 8th April, 2010, and instead of Jaipur, to shift the place of visitation to Delhi.

Chandra Manikyamma, vs B. Sudarsana Rao Alias Saleem ... on 9 September, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/686235/ 19. At the time of marriage, two acres of wet land, forty sovereigns of gold and furniture and cooking vessels were presented to P.W. 1. The income from the landed property was enjoyed by her husband A-1 and her father-in-law A-3. Her husband and the father-in-law used to pledge the gold to get loans whenever money was required for agricultural purposes and they did not render accounts of income on her property. 10. On 4-7-1983, A-1 married A-2 by name Attaluri Lakshmi, daughter of A-7 and A-8 at Teluguraopalem, Krishna District, at about 7.30 a.m. in the house of A-7 according to Hindu rites. P.Ws. 2 to 4, 6 and some others witnessed the second marriage. 11. P.W. 1 came to know about the second marriage through PW 2 on 4-9-1983. On coming to know that P.W. 1 may take any action, A-1 and A-2 converted into Islam and again they married in the house of Mirja Mohishin Ali, Moulvi of Alinekkipalem, hamlet of Shoragundi, according to Muslim rites on 21-2-1984 in the presence of P.Ws. 5 and 7. A-3 to A-8 abetted and arranged the marriage between A-1 and A-2, knowing fully well about the subsistence of the first marriage of A-1 with P.W. 1. 12. A-1 and A-2 are residing with the parents of A-1 and they are observing Hindu formalities and they are not observing Muslim faith. A-1 is not attending the Masjid for Namaj, particularly on Fridays and they are called by their Hindu names in the village. A-1 and A-2 are worshipping Hindu deities and performing Hindu festivals. A-2 is wearing a Mangalasuthram, Metlu and Tilakam. 13. P.W. 1 issued a registered notice through her lawyer. A-1 and A-2 styling themselves as Saleem Mohammed and Laila Banu, sent a reply notice Ex. P-2. In Ex.P-2, the factum of conversion of A-1 and A-2 into Islam and the second marriage under the Muslim rites has been admitted. A-1 admitted in Ex. P-2 that P.W. 1 is his wife and the marriage took place not on 21-4-1976, but on 21-4-l977 at Tirupathi. 14. The Magistrate found that the marriage between A-1 and A-2 was performed on 4-7-1983 at Teluguraopalem in the house of A-7 and A-8. The marriage between A-1 and A-2 in the house of P.W. 7 under Muslim rites on 21-2-1984 also has been proved. The marriage between A-1 and P.W. 1 was subsisting as on the dale of the second marriage either under the Hindu or under the Muslim Law. A-3 to A-8 abetted and facilitated the second marriage between A-1 and A-2 and the Magistrate has accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. 15. On appeal, the learned Addl. Sessions Judge found that there is no evidence to show that there is a legal marriage between P.W. 1 and A-l. A-1 has converted himself as a Mohammedan and he can have four wives at a time and it is not an offence under the Muslim Law. He also found that the marriage between A-1 and A-2 was performed on 21-2-1984 as alleged. It is the first marriage between A-1 and A-2 under the Muslim Law and it is not a void marriage and no offence has been made out under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code. 16. Sri Bali Reddy, learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the marriage between the appellant and the 1st respondent (A-1) was not disputed by the 1st respondent. There was not even aB. Chandra Manikyamma, vs B. Sudarsana Rao Alias Saleem ... on 9 September, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/686235/ 2suggestion made to P.W. 1 when she was in the witness box questioning the said marriage and both the parties proceeded under the impression that P.W. 1 and A-1 are the wife and husband and the finding of the lower appellate court is not correct. It is further contended that the marriage between A-1 and A-2 was performed on 4-7-1983 in accordance with the custom as evidenced by P.Ws. 2 to 4, 6 and others and the well considered finding of the Magistrate ought not to have been set aside by the lower appellate court. It is next contended that the statement made by A-1 that he married A-2 according to Muslim Law would go to show that he was anxious to get over the criminal proceedings under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code. 17. Sri Padmanabha Reddy, learned Counsel for respondents-accused contended that under Law, the first and the second marriages must be proved by the complainant and the find ings of the lower appellate court, basing on the rulings referred to therein are correct and the findings do not warrant any interference by this Court. 18. In a case of reversing judgment, it is the duty of the court to consider whether the reasoning given by the lower appellate court in particular is correct, or not. If the reasoning is not correct and if it is not based on appreciation of correct facts and legal position, then this Court can certainly interfere with the findings of the lower appellate court. 19. A-1 and P.W. 1 are Hindus by the date of their marriage i.e. 21-4-1977. The marriage under the Hindu Law is the voluntary union of one man with one woman to the exclusion of all others satisfied by the sole minzation of the marriage. 20. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down the conditions to be fulfilled In a marriage between any two Hindus. One of the conditions is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. Section 7 of the Act says that (1) a Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto; and (2) where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi (that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken. Section 11 of the Act deals with void marriages. One of the conditions, if contravened, which makes a marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Act null and void, is, if any party thereto has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. Section 17 of the Act reiterating the position and providing for punishment of bigamy, runs thus: Any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living; and the provisions of Sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly. Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code deals with the offence of bigamy reads as under; Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.B.

I respectfully agree with the views expressed by my esteemed Brother, Sethi, J., in the erudite judgment prepared by him, by which the Writ Petitions and the Review Petition are being disposed of finally. I, however, wish to add a few words of my own. Smt. Sushmita Ghosh, who is the wife of Shri G.C. Ghosh (Mohd. Karim Ghazi) filed a Writ Petition [W.P.(C) No. 509 of 1992] in this Court stating that she was married to Shri G.C. Ghosh in accordance with the Hindu rites on 10th May, 1984 and since then both of them were happily living at Delhi. The following paragraphs of the Writ Petition, which are relevant for this case, are quoted below: ""15. That around the 1st of April, 1992, the Respondent No. 3 told the petitioner that she should in her own interest agree to her divorce by mutual consent as he had any way taken to Islam so that he may remarry and in fact he had already fixed to marry one Miss Vanita Gupta resident of D-152 Preet Vihar, Delhi, a divorcee with two children in the second week of July 1992. The Respondent No. 3 also showed a Certificate issued by office of the Maulana Qari Mohammad Idris, Shahi Qazi dated 17th June, 1992 certifying that the Respondent No. 3 had embraced Islam. True copy of the Certificate is annexed to the present petition and marked as Anneuxre-II. 16. That the petitioner contacted her father and aunt and told them about her husband's conversion and intention to remarry. They all tried to convince the Respondent No. 3 and talk him out of the marriage but of no avail and he insisted that Sushmita must agree to her divorce otherwise she will have to put up with second wife. 17. That it may be stated that the Respondent No. 3 has converted to Islam solely for the purpose of re-marrying and has no real faith in Islam. He does not practice the Muslim rites as prescribed nor has he changed his name or religion and other official documents. 18. That the petitioner asserts her fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 15(1) not to be discriminated against on the ground of religion and sex alone. She avers that she has beenLily Thomas, Etc. Etc vs Union Of India & Ors on 5 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1762508/ 1discriminated against by that part of Muslim Personal Law which is enforced by the State Action by virtue of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act, 1937. It is submitted that such action is contrary to Article 15 (1) and is unconstitutional. 19. That the truth of the matter is that Respondent No. 3 has adopted the Muslim religion and became a convert to that religion for the sole purpose of having a second wife which is forbidden strictly under the Hindu Law. It need hardly be said that the said conversion was not a matter of Respondent No. 3 having faith in the Muslim religion. 20. The petitioner is undergoing great mental trauma. She is 34 years of age and is not employed anywhere. 21. That in the past several years, it has become very common amongst the Hindu males who cannot get a divorce from their first wife, they convert to Muslim religion solely for the purpose of marriage. This practice is invariably adopted by those erring husband who embrace Islam for the purpose of second marraige but again become reconvert so as to retain their rights in the properties etc. and continue their service and all other business in their old name and religion. 22. That a Woman's Organisation ""Kalyani"" terribly perturbed over this growing menace and increase in number of desertions of the lawfully married wives under the Hindu Law and splitting up and ruining of the families even where there are childrn and when no grounds of obtaining a divorce successfully on any of the grounds enumerated in Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is available to resort to conversion as a method to get rid of such lawful marriages, has filed a petition in this Hon'ble Court being Civil Writ Petition No. 1079 of 1989 in which this Hon'ble Court has been pleased to admit the same. True copy of the order dated 23.4.90 and the order admitting the petition is annexed to the present petition and marked as Annexure-III (Collectively)."" She ultimately prayed for the following reliefs : ""(a) by an appropriate writ, order or direction, declare polygamy marriages by Hindus and non-Hindus after conversion to Islam religion are illegal and void; (b) Issue appropriate directions to Respondent Nos.1 and 2 to carry out suitable amendments in the Hindu Marriage Act so as to curtail and forbid the practice of polygamy; (c) Issue appropriate direction to declare that where a non Muslim male gets converted to the ""Muslim"" faith without any real change of belief and merely with a view to avoid an earlier marriage or enter into a second marriage, any marriage entered into by him after conversion would be void; (d) Issue appropriate direction to Respondent No. 3 restraining him from entering into any marriage with Miss Vanita Gupta or any other woman during the subsistence of his marriage with the petitioner; and (e) pass such other and further order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case."" This Petition was filed during the summer vacation in 1992. Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah (as he then was), sitting as Vacation Judge, passed the following order on 9th July, 1992 : ""The Writ Petition is taken on board. Heard Mr. Mahajan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner. Issue notice. Learned counsel says that the respondent who was a Hindu by religion and who has been duly and legally married to the petitioner purports to have changed his religion and embraced Islam and that he has done only with a view to take another wife, which would otherwise be an illegal bigamy. Petitioner prays that there should be interdiction of the proposed second marriage which is scheduled to take place tomorrow, i.e. 10th July, 1992. It is urged that the respondent, whose marriage with the petitioner is legal and subsisting cannot take advantage of the feigned conversion so as to be able to take a second wife. All that needs to be said at this stage is that if during the pendency of this writ petition, the respondent proceeds to contract a second marriage and if it is ultimatley held that respondent did not have the legal capacity for the second marriage, the purported marriage would be void."" On 17th July, 1992, when this case was taken up, the following order was passed : ""Counter affidavit shall be filed in four weeks. Place this matter before a Bench ofLily Thomas, Etc. Etc vs Union Of India & Ors on 5 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1762508/ 2which Hon'ble Pandian, J. is a member. Shri Mahajan submitted that since the apprehended second marriage has not yet taken place, it is appropriate that we stop the happening of that event till disposal of this petition. Learned counsel for the respondent-husband says that he would file a counter affidavit within four weeks. He assures that his client would not enter into a marriage in hurry before the counter-affidavit is filed."" On 30th November, 1992, this Writ Petition was directed to be tagged with Writ Petition (C) No. 1079/89 (Smt. Sarla Mudgal, President, ""Kalyani"" & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors.) and W.P. (Civil) No. 347/90 (Sunita @ Fatima vs. Union of India & Ors.). It may be stated that on 23rd April, 1990 when the Writ Petition (C) No. 1079/89 and Writ Petition (C) No. 347/90 were taken up together, the Court had passed the following order : ""Issue Notice to respondent No. 3 returnable within twelve weeks in both the Writ Petitions. Learned counsel for the petitioners in the Writ Petitions, after taking instructions, states that the prayers in both the writ petitions are limited to a single relief, namely, a declaration that where a non-Muslim male gets converted to the Muslim faith without any real change of belief and merely with a view to avoid any earlier marriage or to enter into a second marriage any marraige entered into by him after conversion would be void."" Thus, in view of the pleadings in Smt. Sushmita Ghosh's case and in view of the order passed by this Court in the Writ Petitions filed separately by Smt. Sarla Mudgal and Ms. Lily Thomas, the principal question which was required to be answered by this Court was that where a non-Muslim gets converted to the `Muslim' faith without any real change or belief and merely with a view to avoid an earlier marriage or to enter into a second marriage, whether the marriage entered into by him after conversion would be void? Smt. Sushmita Ghosh, in her Writ Petition, had clearly spelt out that her husband, Shri G.C. Ghosh, had not really converted to `Muslim' faith, but had only feigned conversion to solemnise a second marriage. She also stated that though freedom of religion is a matter of faith, the said freedom cannot be used as a garb for evading other laws where the spouse becomes a convert to `Islam' for the purpose of avoiding the first marriage. She pleaded in clear terms that IT MAY BE STATED THAT THE RESPONDENT NO. 3 HAS CONVERTED TO ISLAM SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RE-MARRYING AND HAS NO REAL FAITH IN ISLAM. HE DOES NOT PRACTICE THE MUSLIM RITES AS PRESCRIBED NOR HAS HE CHANGED HIS NAME OR RELIGION AND OTHER OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. She further stated that the truth of the matter is that Respondent No. 3 has adopted the `Muslim' religion and become a convert to that religion for the sole purpose of having a second wife, which is forbidden strictly under the Hindu Law. It need hardly be said that the said conversion was not a matter of Respondent No. 3 having faith in the Muslim religion. This statement of fact was supported by the further statement made by her in Para 15 of the Writ Petition in which she stated that her husband, Shri G.C. Ghosh, told her that he had taken to `Islam' ""so that he may remarry and in fact he had already fixed to marry one Miss Vanita Gupta resident of D-152 Preet Vihar, Delhi, a divorcee with two children in the second week of July, 1992."" At the time of hearing of these petitions, counsel appearing for Smt. Sushmita Ghosh filed certain additional documents, namely, the birth certificate issued by the Govt. of the Union Territory of Delhi in respect of a son born to Shri G.C. Ghosh from the second wife on 27th May, 1993. In the birth certificate, the name of the child's father is mentioned as ""G.C. Ghosh"" and his religion is indicated as ""Hindu"". The mother's name is described as ""Vanita Ghosh"" and her religion is also described as ""Hindu"". In 1994, Smt. Sushmita Ghosh obtained the copies of the relevant entries in the electoral list of polling station No. 71 of Assembly Constituency-44 (Shahdara), in which the name of Shri G.C. Ghosh appeared at S.No. 182 while the names of his father and mother appeared and S.Nos. 183 and 184 respectively and the name of his wife at S.No.Lily Thomas, Etc.

Whether the Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see             the judgment?                  Yes          2. To be referred to Reporter or not? Yes          3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes G.S.SISTANI, J. (ORAL) 1. The facts which have led to filing of the present contempt petition are that petitioner was married to respondent no.1 on 02.02.2006. Petitioner made a complaint to P.S. Amar Colony, Delhi on 06.08.2007 and subsequently an FIR under sections 498-A/406 was registered on 11.10.2007. Respondent no.1 is the husband; respondent no.2 is the father-in-law and respondent no.3 is the mother-in-law of the petitioner. After the registration of the FIR, the respondents filed an application before the Delhi High Court for grant of anticipatory bail. During the pendency of the application for grant of bail, parties arrived at an amicable settlement, which was recorded in the order dated 23.10.2007. According to this settlement, respondent no.1 agreed to pay a sum of Rs.8.0 lacs to the petitioner herein towards full and final satisfaction of her claims on account of istridhan, maintenance (past, present and future). It was also agreed that respondent would hand over clothes belonging to the petitioner; petitioner would sign first motion for grant of divorce by mutual consent and thereafter parties would sign the final petition under section 13 (b) (ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act. As per this settlement, respondent was to prepare fixed deposit receipts in the total sum of Rs.4.5 lacs which were to be further bifurcated in three FDRs - 1st FDR of Rs.2.0 lacs, 2nd FDR for Rs.1.50 lacs and 3rd FDR for Rs.1.0 lac. These fixed deposit receipts were to be handed over to the petitioner at different stages as detailed in the order. The petitioner herein was also to cooperate and give her no objection for quashing of the FIR which was registered against respondents herein. Counsel for petitioner submits that respondents have willfully violated the orders and undertaking given to Court which were accepted by the Court on 23.10.2007. 2. Counsel for the petitioner submits that on account of demand of dowry and ill treatment melted out to the petitioner, she was forced to file a complaint and thereafter an FIR was registered. It isShikha Bhatia vs Gaurav Bhatia And Ors on 13 May, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34456399/ 1further submitted that in fact respondents had entered into an agreement with the petitioner as an illegal device to seek anticipatory bail, as it is on the basis of this very settlement the court had granted protection to the respondents herein. Counsel also submits that not only the petitioner has been cheated by the respondents, they have also interfered in the administration of justice, besides respondents are trying to overreach the orders passed by this Court. Mr. Deepak Kumar, Advocate, next submits that terms of the settlement have been incorporated in the order dated 23.10.2007. Counsel for petitioner further submits that after the settlement was recorded and the matter was disposed of respondent no.1 moved an application in the Criminal Miscellaneous Petition, seeking extension of time for making the FDR which was disposed of by order dated 08.01.2008. It is further submitted that court had granted time up to 15.02.2008 to the respondent to comply with the terms of the order dated 23.10.2007. Counsel next submits that another application was filed seeking extension of time which was also disposed of on 15.02.2008 and further eight weeks time was granted as a last opportunity to make the payment. The respondent thereafter moved another application (Crl.M.A.No.4309/2008), this time seeking a direction for referring the matter to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre. The application was dismissed and the court had directed compliance of the orders dated 23.10.2007. 3. Counsel for the petitioner has also drawn attention of the Court to the orders dated 01.05.2008 passed in HMA No.146/2007, a petition filed by respondent no.1 under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. This petition was filed by respondent no.1 prior to the order dated 23.10.2007. It is submitted that on 01.05.2008 the counsel for the petitioner (respondent on.1 herein) had made a statement before the court that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, he would be withdrawing the petition under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 4. Counsel for the petitioner submits that despite settlement having been arrived at before the Court and the undertaking given, respondent no.1 has willfully violated the undertaking with impunity. Counsel for petitioner submits that although petitioner no.2 is a witness to the settlement, at this stage, he does not wish to press this petition against respondents no.2 and 3. It is submitted that the act of respondent no.1 in not complying with the order is willful and deliberate and respondent has at no point of time either approached the Court in which the settlement was arrived at for withdrawal of the same and in fact petitioner has been seeking extension of time to comply with the settlement as is evident from the orders dated 08.01.2008 and 15.02.2008. 5. Per contra, it is submitted by counsel for the respondents that no contempt is made out against the respondents in view of the fact that the respondent no.1 was coerced and forced to arrive at a settlement with the petitioner. It is submitted that the contempt petition is not maintainable as the petitioner has already availed of an alternate remedy by way of filing applications [being Bail Appln.No.2305/2007 and 2306/2007] for cancellation of bail, which was granted to the respondents by an order dated 23.10.2007. Counsel further submits that after hearing counsel for both the parties the Court concerned did not consider it appropriate to cancel the bail. 6. Counsel for the respondents has placed reliance on Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, more particularly, sub-section (bb) in support of his plea that when a divorce is sought on theShikha Bhatia vs Gaurav Bhatia And Ors on 13 May, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34456399/ 2ground of mutual consent, such consent should not have been obtained by force, fraud or undue influence. 7. Counsel for the respondents also submits that at the time when the agreement was entered into between the parties, the parties were not residing separately for a period of one year and further the second motion could not have been made earlier than six months after the date of presentation of the petition for first motion under sub-section (1) of Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. An argument has also been raised by counsel for the respondents while relying upon Anil Kumar Jain Vs. Maya Jain, reported at (2009) 10 SCC 415, that the respondent has a right to withdraw the consent given by him at any time before a final decree of divorce has been passed. 8. Another argument raised by counsel for the respondents is that the respondents had only undertaken to the Court to pay a sum of Rs.8.00 lakhs as well as return clothes of the petitioner herein and respondents had not undertaken to sign the first motion and the second motion for grant of divorce to the petitioner. Counsel for the respondents further submits that the petitioner is disentitled to any relief claimed in this petition in view of the fact that by an order dated 23.3.2009 passed in Crl.M.C.NO.1530/2008 a Single Judge of this Court while deciding the application filed by the petitioner for cancellation of bail had directed respondent No.1 to hand over to the I.O. the FDRs in the sum of Rs.4.50 lakhs, which FDRs were to remain in the custody of the I.O. till further directions by the Trial Court. Counsel submits that the petitioner herein, has on the pretext of getting the FDRs renewed, have encashed the FDRs. Counsel next submits that the settlement entered into between the parties, in any case, is hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act as the settlement was forbidden by law for which he also relies on Anil Kumar Jain (supra) and Sandhya Mukhi (supra). 9. I have heard counsel for the parties. The basic facts are not in dispute that marriage between the parties was solemnized on 2.2.2006. On account of demand of dowry and ill treatment the petitioner made a complaint to Police Station Amar Colony, Delhi, on 6.8.2007 on the basis of which an FIR No.51/2007 under Sections 498-A/406/34 IPC was registered at police station Amar Colony on 11.10.2007. Respondents filed an application for grant of anticipatory bail and by an order dated 23.10.2007 settlement arrived at between the parties was recorded and respondents were granted bail. 10. At the time when the matter was pending before the High Court the parties in order to resolve their disputes and differences arrived at an amicable settlement, which is evident from the order dated 23.10.2007. The identical terms of settlement as recorded in the order dated 23.10.2007 was reduced into writing by an agreement dated 6.11.2007, a copy of which has been placed on record, on a date subsequent to the passing of the order of anticipatory bail. This agreement bears the signatures of the petitioner, respondent no.1 as also the father of respondent no.1 [respondent no.2 herein]. As per this agreement while reiterating the terms of settlement as recorded in the order dated 23.10.2007, it was recorded that the clothes of the petitioner that is the wife have been handed over before signing of the agreement and no claim on this account was left. The agreement dated 6.11.2007 entered into between the parties reads as under:-Shikha Bhatia vs Gaurav Bhatia And Ors on 13 May, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34456399/ 3","['13', '23']"

The impugned order is passed on an application challenging the territorial jurisdiction of the Family Court, Pune to try the petition seeking divorce filed by the Respondent under section 13(1)(ia), 25 & 26 of the Act. While the main petition is filed by the Respondent-wife on 5 th November, 2012, the present application is taken out on 22 nd March, 2013 seeking framing of a preliminary issue of jurisdiction of the Family Court and dismissal of the petition for want of proper jurisdiction and in the alternative for return of the petition for filing before the appropriate Court in New Jersey, USA. 2. The facts in brief leading to the present application are:-Mr. Ravindra Harshad Parmar vs Mrs. Dimple Ravindra Parmar on 11 December, 2014 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123861252/ 2The Appellant (original Respondent) immigrated to U.S.A. in the year 1994 and obtained a green card. The Appellant became a naturalised US citizen. The marriage between him and 3 fca72.14 the Respondent was solemnized on 21 st November, 2002. The marriage was registered on the same day and the Appellant returned to U.S. The Respondent went to U.S.A. in the year 2004. The Respondent immigrated to the U.S. And after her permanent resident card (green card) was processed, she lived with the Appellant in Pennsylvania. In September, 2004, the Respondent took up employment with McCarter Theatre in Princetown, New Jersey. 3. The Respondent started her web and multimedia design business sometime in 2005. In October, 2005, the Appellant and the Respondent jointly purchased another town home in Pennington, New Jersey. In December, 2007, the Respondent acquired US citizenship. In July, 2008, the Appellant and Respondent purchased a new house in Manapalan, NJ, which was the marital home of the parties. On 29th October, 2008 the Respondent gave birth to son Reyansh. The petition discloses that the Respondent came to India along with her son Reyansh to attend marriage of the Respondent's sister in March, 2012. The Appellant also visited India on 13 th April, 2012 and returned to U.S. alone. The Respondent did not return to the U.S. thereafter. 4. On 5th November, 2012 the Respondent filed the 4 fca72.14 petition in the Family Court, Pune. On 21st February, 2013 the Appellant-husband filed the proceedings in the Court of New Jersey. It transpires that on 22 nd March, 2013 and 16th April, 2013, the Court in New Jersey issued certain directions as regards the custody of the child holding that the New Jersey Court had jurisdiction over the issue of custody of the child while enforcing its child jurisdiction. In the meanwhile, the Appellant filed an application on 22nd March, 2013 challenging the jurisdiction of the Indian Court under section 9-A of the Civil Procedure Code. The Respondent filed her say to the application on 16th April, 2013 and by an order dated 14 th June, 2013, the learned Judge of the Family Court, Pune dismissed the application. In the application (Exhibit-23), the Appellant submitted that the Respondent had filed instant proceedings surreptitiously and sought permanent and legal custody of the son Reyansh. That the Appellant was compelled to challenge the territorial jurisdiction of the Family Court on the basis of being U.S. citizen and being domiciled in U.S. prior to the marriage. The Appellant contends that the Respondent went to New Jersey, USA, her matrimonial home since 2004 where she has been gainfully employed as a graphic and web designer. She of her own accord had applied for U.S. citizenship on 8 th December, 2007 and that it was done with the intention to reside 5 fca72.14 permanently in U.S. It is also the contended that the Family Court had no jurisdiction to try the petition as the Respondent and the minor son Reyansh were US citizens. It is further contended that the Appellant and the Respondent last resided in New Jersey, U.S. and, therefore, only the Court in New Jersey, U.S.A. will have jurisdiction to entertain and try the petition. 5. The application was opposed by the Respondent vide her reply dated 16th April, 2013 in which the Respondent contended that a person can be a citizen of any country but may be domiciled in some other country and that the application does not consider 19(iii) of the Act or the concept of domicile. Initially the law was that domicile of a wife is that of domicile of the husband.

At a time when a second marriage was prohibited under the provisions of Hindu Prevention of Bigamous Marriage Act (Madras Act 6 of 1949), which had come into force on 23-3-1949, he having married her, she was not his lawfully wedded wife. She was at best a permanent kept-mistress. Defendants 2 and 3 born to them are illegitimate children, and therefore, none of the defendants have any right to the properties left behind by Raju Mudaliar, who died on 7-2-1979. Plaintiffs 1 to 8 are the nearest heirs under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Defendants 2 and 3 are not entitled to inherit his properties because Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act will not apply to them. Since defendants are in unlawful possession of the plaint schedule properties, plaintiffs have filed the present suit. 4. Defendants took up the stand that the marriage between the first defendant and Raju Mudaliar was performed according to Hindu rites on 7-5-1948 (sic) (1949?) at Tiruvanmiyur Temple, and that the said marriage was not void under Madras Act 6 of 1949. First defendants and the plaintiffs and the children born to them were all living together in the same premises at St. Mary's Road for about 8 years, and that the mother of Raju Mudaliar was also alive, and that the house in Narayana Chetty Street was built by him for the benefit of the first defendant and children were born to her. The suit property was purchased three years after the marriage for her benefit. If really the marriage was void, the plaintiffs would not have kept quiet since 1949. Hence the suit is liable to be dismissed. 5. Trial Court dismissed the suit by holding that Raju Mudaliar married first defendant on 7-5-1949 at Thiruvanmiyur Temple, and the said marriage was not void under Madras Act 6 of 1949, and that the plaintiff, defendants, Raju Mudaliar and his mother were all living together as one family, and that during the life time of Raju Mudaliar, the status of the first defendant was never questioned. On appeal in A.S. No. 184 of 1981, the learned Judge by relying upon the date of marriage furnished by Raju Mudaliar in the will (Exhibit A-3) dated 21-10-1966 held that he married the first defendant only on 1-5-1949, and hence, the said marriage was hit by Madras Act 6 of 1949, which became aValliammal vs Kamalambal And 8 Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1538896/ 1statute on 23-3-1949. Consequently it was held that she would not be entitled to any share, but her two daughters viz. defendants 2 and 3 are equally entitled to a share along with the plaintiffs though they are illegitimate. Reliance was placed on Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act for granting the said relief. Taking note of the fact that parties are co-sharers, except to pass a declaratory decree, the learned Judge directed the parties to obtain appropriate reliefs by filing a suit for partition and separate possession. Aggrieved against this decision, this Letters Patent Appeal is preferred by plaintiffs. Mr. T. Viswanatha Rao learned Counsel for the plaintiffs, submits that, having held that Raju Mudaliar married first defendant on 1-5-1949, and such a marriage is hit by Madras Act 6 of 1949, defendants 2 and 3 could not have been granted any declaratory relief regarding their share; because as illegitimate children, they cannot be treated on a par with plaintiffs 2 to 8, because Section 16(3) of the amended Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case. Any marriage of this character preceding Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 would not come within the folds of the relief extended under Section 16(3) of the Act. It is only prospective in its applicability and hence, the rights of defendants 2 and 3 would be as was obtaining under the Hindu Law before the passing of the Hindu Marriage Act, and the Hindu Succession Act. 6. Mr. T.R. Mani, learned counsel for the defendants, would submit that the purpose of introducing amendment to the Act in 1976 was to extend the benefit of legitimisation available to bastards. When an amendment was made not only to Hindu Marriage Act but also to Special Marriage Act, it was intended to be as far as possible beneficial, and in essence it is retrospective, because as held by Courts, the mischief which is sought to be removed by the amendment, will determine the scope of the amendment, and that if the benefit is confined only to children, of bigamous marriages under Hindu Marriage Act and not to children born out of such marriages which had taken place prior to it, it would offend Article 14 of the Constitution. He would also touch upon the trend of legislations intended to bring about social reforms and how to eschew arbitrariness, and as how the object of an amendment, require to be interpreted to eradicate the mischief which it seeks to avoid, and that clear interpretation, if applied, would remove the concept of bastard was, which no human being would ever like to have. 7. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was amendment by the Marriage Laws of Amendment Act, 1976, with effect from 27-5-1976 to the following effect : ""(1) Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. (2) Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date of the decree it had been dissolved instead of being annulled, shall be deemed to be their legitimate child not withstanding the decree of nullity.Valliammal vs Kamalambal And 8 Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1538896/ 2(3) Nothing contained in Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void or which if annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents."" 8. Section 11 of Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows : ""Any marriage solemnised after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may on a petition presented by either party thereto (against the other party) be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Cls. (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5"" 9. Regarding the finding as to when Raju Muduliar was married to first defendant, as pointed out by the learned Judge except for the first defendant and her brother, none has come forward to speak about the marriage, and therefore, having rightly characterised their evidence as interested, reliance was placed on the unimpeachable contents of Exhibit A-3 will dated 21-10-1967. It was executed by Raju Mudaliar in favour of first defendant, long before disputes arose between the parties. No doubt it was revoked under Ex. A-4 dated 15-11-1974, but even then, as a piece of evidence, its contents were relied upon and in this view, the learned Judge had rightly concluded that this piece of documentary evidence clinchingly proves that the marriage took place only on 1-5-1949. Madras Act 6 of 1949 prohibiting bigamy came into force on 23-3-1949. The marriage which took place on 1-5-1949 being invalid and inoperative in law, the children born out of such relationship are illegitimate. 10. It is contended by Mr. T.R. Mani, learned counsel for the defendants, that this illegitimacy would not disentitle them to get an equal share like that of legitimate children of Raju Mudaliar, in view of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which had been amended with effect from 27-5-1976 by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 68 of 1976). He submits that children born out of such bigamous relationship, by virtue of this amendment, are entitled to be treated on a par with that of the legitimate children. Mr. Viswanatha Rao, learned counsel for the plaintiff, would submit that Section 16, a non-obstanti provision, deals with only a specific class of illegitimate children born out of a marriage which will be null and void under Section 11 and confined to children, who were born before or after the commencement of the Amendment Act i.e. before or after 27-5-1976. As for children born before that date, it is confined to the offsprings of the marriages which had been ""solemnised after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 i.e. after 18-5-1955 and not in respect of marriages which had taken place antecedent to that date. 11. Learned Counsel would first refer to the decision of the Division Bench reported in Shantaram v. Dagubai, which, in dealing with the scope of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, has held that whether a decree of nullity is passed or not, a child born out of a marriage which is void under the provisions of the Act is the legitimate child. It was further held that it does not acquire a right to property by birth which a legitimate child would get; but after legitimacy conferred upon him under Section 16(3) of the Act, it enables him to get an equal share in the property of his parents. Such a right is conferred (? confined) only to separate property and not in respect of coparcenary propertyValliammal vs Kamalambal And 8 Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1538896/ 3","['5', '11', '12', '16']"

The only question that is raised in this second appeal is whether a woman, who has married a man when the earlier marriage has not been dissolved in accordance with law and when the first wife is still living, is a wife, who is entitled to claim maintenance under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. 2. According to the learned counsel for the appellant she is entitled to claim maintenance. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that she is not entitled to claim maintenance and that, a Division Bench of this court is squarely on the point and would bind this decision in this second appeal. 3. Section 18 of the Act reads as follows: ""Maintenance of wife.-- (1)Subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. (2) A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim to maintenance.- (d) if he has any other wife living; 4. The law of maintenance applicable to Hindus is now totally covered by the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. Of course excluding whatever right they have under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapter 3 of the Act is a complete code with regard to law of maintenance. 5. The question is whether the Hindu wife referred to in section (2) includes also a wife whose marriage is void or voidable. 6. In Kopparthi Satyanarayana Vs. Smt. Kopparti Seetharamamma , the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was called upon to consider Section 2, Clause (d) of the Hindu Women's Right to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act (1946), and as per this Act the Hindu Married women shall be entitled to separate residence on one or more of the grounds mentioned in the section which included Clause (d) which is, ""if he marries again"". The Full Bench had to interpret the above expression to solve the question whether a Hindu wife whose husband had married another wife before the commencement of the Act would obtain the benefit of the section and the Full Bench held that, ""This Section has been so drafted as to take in all cases of husbands having their other wives living. So this has undoubtedly a wider scope than the one which we are required to construe. ItJayalakshmi vs Krishna Padayachi on 4 September, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1088640/ 1shows that when the Legislature thought of including all Hindus who were married more than once, it had employed comprehensive language. A comparison of the language of the two clauses leads to the inescapable conclusion that cl.(4) of S. 2 covers only future marriages."" 7. In Subbegowda V. Honnamma and another , it was held that, ""The expression ""any other wife"" in Section 18(2)(d) means any other legally wedded wife. Therefore, even if the husband was living with another woman treating her as his wife, it cannot be said that he ""has any other wife living"" within the meaning of S. 18(2)(d)."" 8. In Dr. Ranjit Kumar Bhattacharyya V. Smt. Sabita Bhattacharyya , marriage was alleged between a Hindu wife and a Christian husband purported to have taken place according to Hindu rites after Hindu Marriage Act came into force. The marriage between husband and his first wife which had been solemnised according to Christian rites was still subsisting. It was held by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court that the second marriage cannot confer status of lawful wife since it was void ipso jure. It was held that a marriage in contravention of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act was null and void and has to be ignored as not existing in law at all. Therefore, while allowing the appeal filed by the husband, directed him to pay to the respondent Rs.30,000/- as damages for his misdeeds. 9. In Saraswathamma Vs. Bhadramma (AIR 1970 Mysore 157), it was held that the first wife's claim of maintenance will accrue only if the second marriage was a valid one. 10. In T.P.K. Natesan Chettiar V. Achiyayee Ammal , a Division Bench of this Court held that ""if a person had contracted a second marriage subsequent to the coming into force of the Madras Hindu (Bigamy Prevention and Divorce) Act, when the first wife was living, that marriage is void by reason of Section 4 of the Act. If however the marriage had taken place prior to the enactment of the statute such marriage is valid. In such a case the first wife is entitled to maintenance from the husband by reason of the provisions contained in Section 18(2)(d) of the Hindus Adoptions and Maintenance Act."" Reference was made in that case to an earlier Division Bench judgment quoted in A.P.K. Narayanaswamy Reddiar V. Padmanabhan (minor) and others (1966 (1) MLJ 529) where it was held that in law, a woman can be given recognition either as the wife of a man or as his concubine and that there cannot be an intermediary clause picturesquely described as an ""illegitimate wife"". But in that case, it was held that the second marriage was celebrated before the coming of the relevant acts and therefore, the right to maintenance was upheld. 11. In Smt. Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav V. Anantrao Shivram Adhav and another , the Supreme Court held that the expression ""wife"" in Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure means a legally wedded wife. In marriage of a woman with a man already having a living spouse as per Hindu rites is a complete nullity. The Supreme Court considered the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of Hindu Marriage Act and held that while the cases covered by Section 12 are not void ab initio and such marriages continue to be effective unless the aggrieved party chooses to avoid it. The marriages covered by Section 11 are void ipso jure, that is, void from the very inception, and have to be ignored as not existing in law at all if and when such a question arises.Jayalakshmi vs Krishna Padayachi on 4 September, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1088640/ 212. In A.P.K. Narayanaswamy Reddiar V. Padmanabhan (minor) and others (1966 (1) MLJ 529), the question arose whether a woman marrying a man bigamously can claim maintenance from the latter. ""It is true that the medieval conservative approach in progressive times should be avoided, with reference to laws which purport to make reforms and introduce innovations in personal laws in order that womenfolk particularly are invested with more rights and better freedom. But while a legislative enactment may be liberally construed, the liberality cannot overstep the legitimate limits of interpretation and put into the legislation something which is not there."" ""We come back, therefore, to the question whether, where the factum of marriage is established and the form of it is in accordance with the personal law, but because it is bigamous, it is void, the woman, who is a contracting party, could still be regarded as a wife or something in between a wife and a concubine, with a right to claim maintenance from the man. Apart from considerations of morals or sympathy, we are unable to say that there is a status of wifehood for such a woman intermediate between the legitimate wife, so to speak, and a concubine. There is no textual authority or statutory authority to be found for such a position, not do we feel justified that we can recognise such a status, especially when the policy of the law is to declare a bigamous marriage as void and, in fact, constitute it as a crime, which is liable to be punished. We are of the view, therefore, that the fourth plaintiff has no right to maintenance, and the Court below was not justified in granting her any maintenance."" 13. In view of the decision of the Division Bench of our Court, by which I am bound it is difficult to hold in favour of the appellant. If the observation of the Full Bench in the extracted above is accepted then necessarily, wives like the appellant must be able to draw benefit. 14. Section 18(1) of the Act deals with a Hindu wife whether married before or after the commencement of this Act. Therefore, regardless of whether the marriage was pre 1956 or post 1956, she can claim maintenance under this Act. Section (2) refers to a Hindu wife who is entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim to maintenance. The Hindu wife mentioned in sub-section (2) cannot be different from the ""Hindu wife"" mentioned in sub-section(1), since there is no such indication. Therefore, in section (2), the words ""Hindu Wife"" should also be understood as a Hindu wife married before or after the commencement of the Act. With regard to a Hindu wife if she is married before the commencement of the Act and if there is a second wife, who was also married before the commencement of the Act, then either of them can claim maintenance under this Act because the Hindu Marriage Act, which laid down the conditions of a valid marriage had not come into force and therefore, those marriages were valid, though the second marriage being bigamous may be illegal. The difficulty arises with regard to a wife, who was married after the Act. The Section does not say that the wife who is entitled to live separately must be the first wife. Indeed, after the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 18(2)(d) can have no meaning because there cannot be two valid marriages and there cannot be two 'wives' living at the same time. But it must be so construed as to make it meaningful or rational. 15. In AIR 1976 A.P. 44, the learned Judge has dealt with this riddle.Jayalakshmi vs Krishna Padayachi on 4 September, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1088640/ 3","[ '4', '18', '2', '12', '11']"

By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the appellant seeks to challenge the impugned judgment and decree dated 12.05.2003 passed by the learned ADJ, Delhi thereby dismissing the divorce petition filed by the appellant under Section 13(1) (ia) & (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. Brief facts of the case relevant for deciding the present appeal are that the marriage between the appellant and the respondent was solemnized on 29.11.1984 at Mathura, U.P according to Hindu rites and ceremonies. From this wedlock, two children were born i.e. on 10.02.1988 and 12.09.1992. Both the parties lived together as husband and wife for 14 years i.e. upto 15.02.1998. The acts of cruelty based on which the appellant-husband has sought decree of divorce under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act mainly are that after the death of the father of the appellant the mother of the respondent started living with them and due to her presence the atmosphere in the house got so surcharged that even the children started avoiding the appellant; the appellant though lived in the same house, but had to cook his own food and do all his personal work himself; he felt neglected and depressed on account of the behaviour of the respondent and her mother and ultimately on 15.02.1998 the appellant started living separately; the appellant made all efforts for rapprochement but the respondent foiled all his attempts; the respondent gave instructions to the school authoritiesSubhash Chander Sharma vs Anjali Sharma on 14 July, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114436184/ 1that the appellant should not be allowed to meet the children; the respondent avoided to come to official telephone so as to talk with the appellant; the appellant was insulted by the respondent and her mother when he went to contact the respondent; the appellant was not even allowed to enter in the house; the respondent shifted her residence from housing society to some other place and she had also given instructions to her office not to disclose her new address to her husband; the appellant also wrote various letters to the respondent, but she did not respond to the same. The appellant has also averred that he has not condoned the acts of cruelty complained of against the respondent. 3. So far the ground of desertion is concerned, the appellant averred that the respondent had deserted him without any reasonable cause and against his wishes. The appellant has also averred that there has not been any willful neglect on his part and for no fault of the appellant the respondent deserted him. 4. The respondent did not choose to appear after having been duly served with the notice. She, however, sent reply by post, making certain allegations against the appellant. Accordingly, the respondent was proceeded ex parte by the Court vide orders dated 28.01.2003. 5. In the evidence, the appellant examined himself as PW-1 and except his own evidence he did not adduce any further evidence. In his evidence, the appellant deposed that he got married to the respondent on 29.11.1984 at Mathura, U.P and since thereafter they were living together as husband and wife. He also deposed that out of the said wedlock, two children i.e. one daughter and one son were born on 10.02.1988 and 12.09.1992 respectively. He further deposed that he was forced to leave the house on 15.02.1998 due to the circumstances created by the respondent and her mother, when she had joined them after the death of the father of the appellant in the year 1996. It would be relevant to reproduce the entire evidence of the appellant as under:- ""PW1 Subhash Chander Sharma, petitioner. On S.A.:- I got married on 22nd of Nov. 1985 with the respondent. Marriage took place at Mathura, U.P. Reception was held in Delhi. Since then we were living together as husband and wife upto 15 th February, 1998. On 15.02.1998 I was forced to leave the house due to the circumstances created by respondent and her mother who joined us on the death of my father in 1996. The relation was unbearable facing lot of depression and continuous failure in life. I faced lot of embarrassment in the relations. I faced mental agony by continuing in the circumstances. Out of the wedlock we had two children, daughter named Anupriya date of birth 10/2/88, son Chinmay Sharma date of birth 12 Sept. 1992. After the separation she issued instructions to the school authorities not to allow me to meet the children. My every effort for reapproachment was foiled by her. She did not attend even the phone calls I made at her official telephone. Even my letters which were of personal natureSubhash Chander Sharma vs Anjali Sharma on 14 July, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114436184/ 2were not responded at all. My friends and relatives whosoever tried for the reapproachment faced humiliation and insult which closed the door at me for reapproachment. The respondent deserted me without any major cause and reasonable cause. I have not condoned the acts of cruelties and the petition has not been filed in collusion with the respondent. My petition is correct. sd/-       RO& AC                                  ADJ/Delhi                                              6/3/2003"" 6. The appellant was not cross-examined by the respondent as she was proceeded ex parte by the Court. Based on the case set up by the appellant in his divorce petition and the said ex parte evidence adduced by him, the learned trial court came to the conclusion that the allegations of cruelty leveled by the appellant do not constitute cruelty as envisaged under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. So far as the ground of desertion is concerned, the learned trial court found that it is the appellant himself who left the matrimonial home on 15.02.1998, therefore, no evidence on record has been adduced by the appellant to prove that the respondent had any intention to bring the cohabitation permanently to an end. The learned trial court thus found that the appellant failed to establish any „animus deserendi on the part of the respondent and in the absence of the same, the ground of desertion was also found to be not available to the appellant. 7. Assailing the said judgment and decree of the learned trial court, the appellant preferred the present appeal. Counsel appearing for the appellant strongly contended that the respondent has neither contested the petition before the learned trial court nor she is contesting the present appeal and, therefore, such conduct on the part of the respondent would be manifest of the fact that the marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken down. Counsel thus submitted that this Court may direct dissolution of the marriage of the parties on the said ground itself. Counsel for the appellant further contended that the appellant fully established both the grounds of divorce i.e. cruelty as well as desertion beyond any shadow of doubt, but still the learned trial court dismissed the petition filed by the appellant. Counsel further contended that the learned trial court committed grave error by not appreciating the fact that the divorce proceedings were not contested by the respondent and, therefore, the evidence of the appellant remained unrebutted. 8. In support of his arguments, counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Naveen Kohli Vs. Neelu Kohli (2006) 4 SCC 558 and the judgment of this Court in the case of Gauri Shankar Dhanwaria Vs. Maya Devi, 2003(107) DLT 583.Subhash Chander Sharma vs Anjali Sharma on 14 July, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114436184/ 3","['28', '13']"

CIVIL APPEAL NO.4629 OF 2005 Appellant-husband, aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 11th of April, 2005 passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Family Court Appeal No. 11 of 2005 reversing the judgment and order dated 1st of January, 2005 passed by the Family Court, Mumbai at Bandra in Interim Application No. 235 of 2004 in Petition No. A-531 of 2004, is before us with the leave of the Court.Sondur Gopal vs Sondur Rajini on 15 July, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140502088/ 1Shorn of unnecessary details, facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the marriage between the appellant-husband and the respondent-wife took place on 25th of June, 1989 according to the Hindu rites at Bangalore. It was registered under the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act also. After the marriage the husband left for Sweden in the first week of July, 1989 followed by the wife in November, 1989. They were blessed with two children namely, Natasha and Smyan. Natasha was born on 19th of September, 1993 in Sweden. She is a down syndrome child. The couple purchased a house in Stockholm, Sweden in December, 1993. Thereafter, the couple applied for Swedish citizenship which was granted to them in 1997. In June, 1997, the couple moved to Mumbai as, according to the wife, the employer of the husband was setting up his business in India. The couple along with child Natasha lived in India between June, 1997 and mid 1999. In mid 1999, the husband’s employer offered him a job in Sydney, Australia which he accepted and accordingly moved to Sydney, Australia. The couple and the child Natasha went to Sydney on sponsorship visa which allowed them to stay in Australia for a period of 4 years. While they were in Australia, in the year 2000, the husband disposed of the house which they purchased in Stockholm, Sweden. The second child, Smyan was born on 9th February, 2001 at Sydney. The husband lost his job on 7th July, 2001 and since he no longer had any sponsorship, he had to leave Australia in the second week of January, 2002. The couple and the children shifted to Stockholm and lived in a leased accommodation till October, 2002 during which period the husband had no job. On 2nd of October, 2002, the husband got another job at Sydney and to join the assignment he went there on 18th of December, 2002. But before that on 14th of December, 2002, the wife along with children left for Mumbai. Later, on 31st of January, 2003, the wife and the children went to Australia to join the appellant- husband. However, the wife and the children came back to India on 17th of December, 2003 on a tourist visa whereas the husband stayed back in Sydney. According to the husband, in January, 2004 he was informed by his wife that she did not wish to return to Sydney at all and, according to him, he came back to India and tried to persuade his wife to accompany him back to Sydney. According to the husband, he did not succeed and ultimately the wife filed petition before the Family Court, Bandra inter alia praying for a decree of judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act and for custody of the minor children Natasha and Smyan. After being served with the notice, the husband appeared before the Family Court and filed an interim application questioning the maintainability of the petition itself. According to the husband, they were original citizens of India but have “acquired citizenship of Sweden in the year 1996-1999 and as citizens of Sweden domiciled in Australia”. According to the husband, the wife along with the children “arrived in India on 17th of December, 2003 on a non-extendable tourist visa for a period of six months and they had confirmed air tickets to return to Sydney on 27th of January, 2004” and therefore, “the parties have no domicile in India and, hence, the parties would not be governed by the Hindu Marriage Act”. According to the husband, “the parties by accepting the citizenship of Sweden shall be deemed to have given up their domicile of origin, that is, India” and acquired a domicile of choice by the combination of residence and intention of permanent or indefinite residence. The husband has also averred that the domicile of the wife shall be that of the husband and since they have abandoned their domicile of origin and acquired a domicile of choice outside the territories of India, the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act shall not apply to them. Consequently, the petition by the wife for judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act and custody of the children is not maintainable. According to the husband, he did not have any intentionSondur Gopal vs Sondur Rajini on 15 July, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140502088/ 2to “give up the domicile of choice namely the Australian domicile nor have the parties acquired a third domicile of choice or resumed the domicile of origin” and, therefore, provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would not be applicable to them. In sum and substance, the plea of the husband is that they are citizens of Sweden presently domiciled in Australia which is their domicile of choice and having abandoned the domicile of origin i.e. India, the jurisdiction of the Family Court, Mumbai is barred by the provisions of Section 1(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act. As against this, the case set up by the wife is that their domicile of origin is India and that was never given up or abandoned though they acquired the citizenship of Sweden and then moved to Australia. According to the wife, even if it is assumed that the husband had acquired domicile in Sweden, she never changed her domicile and continued to be domiciled in India. The wife has set up another alternative plea. According to her, even if it is assumed that she also had acquired domicile of Sweden, that was abandoned by both of them when they shifted to Australia and, therefore, their domicile of origin, that is, India got revived. In short, the case of the wife is that both she and her husband are domiciled in India and, therefore, the Family Court in Mumbai has jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by her seeking a decree for judicial separation and custody of the children. The husband in support of his case filed affidavit of evidence and he has also been cross-examined by the wife. According to the husband “even before the marriage he visited Stockholm, Sweden in Spring, 1985” and “immediately taken in by the extraordinary beauty of the place and warmth and friendliness of the people”. According to the husband, the first thought which occurred to him was that “Stockholm is the place where” he “wanted to live and die”. According to his evidence, at the time of marriage in 1989, he was a domicile of Sweden. From this the husband perhaps wants to convey that he abandoned the domicile of his birth, that is, India and acquired Sweden as the domicile of choice. He went on to say that “keeping in mind wife’s express desire to be in English speaking country” he “accepted the offer to move to Sydney, Australia”. His specific evidence is that “parties herein are Swedish citizens, domiciled in Australia”, hence, according to the husband, “only the courts in Australia will have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition of this nature”. The husband has further claimed that “on 5th of April, 2004, the day wife had filed the petition” he “had acquired domicile status of Sydney, Australia”. As regards domicile status on the date of cross-examination, that is, 17.11.2004, he insisted to be the domicile of Australia. It is an admitted position that the day on which husband claimed to be the domicile of Australia, that is, 05.04.2004, he was not citizen of that country or had ever its citizen but had 457 visa which, according to his own evidence “is a long term business permit and it is not a domicile document”. The family court, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the application filed by the husband and held the petition to be not maintainable. While doing so, the family court observed that “it cannot be held” that “the husband has never given up his domicile of origin, i.e., India.” However, in appeal, the High Court by the impugned order has set aside the order of the family court and held the petition filed by the wife to be maintainable. While doing so, the High Court held that “the husband has miserably failed to establish that he ever abandoned Indian domicile and/or intended to acquire domicile of his choice”. Even assuming that the husband had abandoned his domicile of origin and acquired domicile of Sweden along with citizenship,Sondur Gopal vs Sondur Rajini on 15 July, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/140502088/ 3","['1', '10']"

The plaintiffs filed the present suit in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division at Rajkot for a declaration that the agreement of sale executed by the defendant No. 3 in favour of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 was not binding upon the plaintiffs and that the consent decree passed in Special Civil Suit No. 5 of 1966 between the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 on one hand and the defendant No. 3 on the other hand was also not binding on them. 2. The defendants filed their Written Statement and contested the suit. The defendants Nos. 1 and 2 thereafter made application, Ex. 22 for raising and deciding a preliminary issue as to the Court-fees and jurisdiction of the Court. The plaintiffs resisted that application. 3. The learned Trial Judge after hearing both the parties decided that application and held that the preliminary issue which the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 had sought should be raised. However, what he, in fact, did was not to raise the issue in the form in which issues are raised but, having held that the aforesaid preliminary issue be raised, he heard the parties on merits of that issue and straightway recorded his findings in the order below Ex. 22. The learned Trial Judge by his said order did not direct the plaintiffs to pay any additional Court-fees but held that the claim in suit ought to have been valued at Rupees 12,000/- which according to the learned Trial Judge represented 4/5th share of the four plaintiffs in the property in question - only 1/5th going to the defendant No. 3 who is the father of the three plaintiffs and husband of the defendant No. 4. It was the defendant No. 3 who had executed the agreement of sale in respect of the property in question in favour of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 and against whom the aforesaid consent decree for specific performance of the contract was passed in Special Civil Suit No. 5 of 1966 in respect of which the plaintiffs have sought a declaration that it is not binding upon them. Having recorded the aforesaid finding the learned Judge made the following operative order. ""This Court has no pecuniary jurisdiction. Hence this suit to be dismissed from the file of the Court and plaint to be returned to the plaintiffs for presentation and hearing by the proper Court."" 4. It is against this order that this Civil Revision Application has been filed. 5. The order which the learned Trial Judge has made is contradictory in terms. If the suit is dismissed the plaint cannot be returned for presentation to the proper Court. If the plaint is ordered to be returned for presentation to the proper Court the suit cannot be dismissed. The learned Trial Judge has combined both these contradictory directions in the operative part of the order which he has made below Ex. 22. Therefore, irrespective of whether this Civil Revision Application succeeds or fails. The order which the learned Trial Judge has made shall have to be corrected. I shall revert to it after I decide the contentions raised by the learned Advocates on the merits of the case.Khimji Jiva And Ors. vs Narendra Kumar Maganlal Shah And ... on 25 January, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/633673/ 16. One of the contentions raised before me is that the value of the subject-matter in the present suit is incapable of monetary evaluation. In order to appreciate this contention it is necessary to have a fresh look at a few facts and the prayers which the plaintiffs have made. The three plaintiffs who are the sons of the defendant No. 3 have filed this suit for a declaration that the agreement of sale in respect of an immoveable property which the defendant No. 3 executed in favour of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 is not binding upon them and that the decree for specific performance of that agreement of sale obtained by the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 against the defendant No. 3 in Special Civil Suit No. 5 of 196 is also not binding upon them. In spite of the present suit filed by the three sons of the defendant No. 3 it is open to the defendant No. 3 to comply with the decree for specific performance passed in the aforesaid suit and honour the agreement of sale which he has executed in favour of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 if he (the defendant No. 3) so choose. If he so acts, it will not affect the plaintiffs' right in the property if they are otherwise found to have any. Therefore, the plaintiffs, in my opinion, do not want the agreement of sale or any alienation (if there is one) by the defendant No. 3 to be set aside as the learned Trial Judge has erroneously assumed. They want only to prevent the consent decree obtained by the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 against the defendant No. 3 in the aforesaid suit and the agreement of sale executed by the defendant No. 3 in favour of the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 from clouding their rights to the property in question. The want to avoid that effect. A suit filed to avoid such an effect and to have the cloudy weather cleared is in my opinion, incapable of being evalued in monetary terms. 7. If the plaintiffs themselves had done anything which they wanted to avoid, cancel or undo, the position would have been different. It would have probably meant that they wanted to sell the property which they themselves had purported to alienate or in respect of which they had purported to extinguish or destroy their own rights. 8. A situation wherein a person tries to perform an act or do something which clouds the rights of another and a situation in which a person does something by which he purports to extinguish or destroys his own rights are two entirely different situations. In my opinion, the relief claimed under the facts constituting the first situation is incapable of monetary evaluation. Whether the relief claimed by a person under the facts constituting the second situation is capable or incapable of monetary evaluation does not arise for my consideration and I, therefore, do not propose to express any opinion on that hypothetical situation. In the view which I have taken the order which the learned trial Judge has made valuing the subject-matter in dispute in the suit between the parties at Rs. 12000/- is erroneous. That finding recorded by the learned trial Judge must, therefore, be set aside. 9. Since I have held that the subject-matter of the plaintiffs' claim is incapable of monetary evaluation, the court-fees on such a claim will have obviously to be paid under Section 6(iv)(j) of the Bombay Court-fees act, 1959. The question, however, which has been raised before me is a question of jurisdiction. Does a Civil Judge (Junior Division) have jurisdiction to entertain and try a suit in which the subject-matter is incapable of monetary evaluation? Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act, 1887 need not detain me to answer this question because it in terms applies to cases where court-fees are payable ad valorem. On my finding that is not the situation in the present case. Section 6(iv)(j) of the Bombay Court-fees Act. Rs. 30/-. Therefore, Section 8 of the Suits ValuationKhimji Jiva And Ors. vs Narendra Kumar Maganlal Shah And ... on 25 January, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/633673/ 2Act, 1887 has no application to the present case. 10. Whether a Civil Hudge (Junior Division) or a Civil Judge (Senior Division) shall have jurisdiction to decide a suit of this type is to be determined with reference to Section 24 of the Bombay Civil Courts Act. 1869. It is that Act which determines the forum for a suit. The first two paragraphs of Section 24 of the Bombay Civil Courts Act, 1869 (hereinafter referred to for the sake of brevity as the 'Bombay Act') provide as follows. ""The Civil Judges shall be of two classes. Jurisdiction of Civil Judge (Senior Division): The jurisdiction of a Civil Judge (Senior Division) extends to all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature. Jurisdiction of Civil Judge (Junior Division): The jurisdiction of a Civil Judge (Junior Division) extends to all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature wherein the subject-matter does not exceed in amount or value ten thousand rupees."" The proviso to Section 24 is not material for the purpose of the present case. Paragraph 2 of Section 24, in may opinion, lays down the test for determining the Court which shall have jurisdiction to try a particular suit. That test is whether the value of the subject-matter exceeds Rs. 10,000/- or does not exceed it. If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, a Civil Judge (Junior Division) shall have no jurisdiction to try such a suit. It shall have to be tried by a Civil Judge (Senior Division) who has the residuary original jurisdiction. If the answer is in the negative, a Civil Judge (Junior Division) shall have jurisdiction to try that suit. Either a Civil Jude (Junior Division) can hear it or a Civil Judge (Senior Division) who has unlimited jurisdiction can also hear it provided the suit is within his ordinary territorial jurisdiction. The difficulty arises when no answer can be given to the question whether the subject-matter exceeds Rs. 10,000/- or does not exceed Rs. 10,000. In my opinion, what is incapable of monetary evaluation cannot be said either to exceed Rs. 10,000 or not to exceed Rupees 10,000. What is incapable of monetary evaluation cannot even by a fiction or by any wild imagination be said to be below Rs. 10,000 in value or above it. If, therefore, in a given case, as in the present case, on account of the fact that the value of the subject-matter is incapable of monetary evaluation, no answer can be given to the aforesaid question - which court has the jurisdiction to try it? In my opinion, a Civil Judge (Junior Division) has jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature in which it can be definitely predicated that the value of the subject-matter in dispute between the parties does not exceed Rs. 10,000/-. All other suits must necessarily, therefore, of to the Civil Judge (Senior Division) who exercises, as stated hereinabove, all other original civil jurisdiction including the residuary original civil jurisdiction except the jurisdiction which has been conferred upon Civil Judge (Junior Division) by paragraph 2 of Section 24 of the Bombay Act. 11. Therefore, in my opinion where the value of the subject-matter is either indisputably incapable incapable of monetary evaluation or where it is found by the Court, upon a dispute having been raised in that behalf by the parties, to be incapable of monetary evaluation, the jurisdiction to entertain and try it lies with Civil Judge (Senior Division) alone. For the purpose of analogy the provisions of Section 8 and Section 26 of the Bombay Act may be looked appellant the test which has been laid down in Section 26 for the purpose of appeals is different. It provides as under.Khimji Jiva And Ors. vs Narendra Kumar Maganlal Shah And ... on 25 January, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/633673/ 3","['6', '26', '24', '8']"
162,"Bombay High Court Rameshchandra Rampratapji Daga vs Rameshwari Rameshchandra Daga on 20 January, 2000 Equivalent citations: II (2001) DMC 230 Author: J Patil Bench: A Shah, J Patil JUDGMENT J.A. Patil, J. 1. This Appeal by the original respondent is directed against the judgment and decree dated 9.10.1995 passed in M.J. Petition No. A-756 of 1990 by the learned Judge of the Family Court at Mumbai. The learned Judge allowed the petition filed by the present respondent under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act for judicial separation and other reliefs, The learned Judge, however, dismissed the appellant's counter-claim for a declaration of nullity of marriage. Feeling aggrieved thereby the original respondent-husband has filed this appeal. The original petitioner-wife has also filed cross-objections. The relevant facts necessary for deciding this appeal and the cross-objections are, in brief, as under. 2. The parties belong to Maheshwari community and both of them were married on 11.7.1981 at Mumbai as per the Hindu Vedic rites. At the time of marriage the respondent was a divorcee since she had previously married with one Shri Gidharilal Lakhotia in 1973 but there was subsequently divorce as per the registered divorce deed dated 15.5.1979, The appellant was a widower with three children; his first wife Usha having died some time in 1979. The marriage between the parties was settled marriage. After the marriage the respondent started residing with the appellant in their matrimonial home at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh. The appellant is an Income Tax Practitioner. According to the respondent she gave a birth to a still born male child on 12.4.1982. Thereafter she again remained pregnant and delivered a female child on 14.7.1983. The baby was named as Pooja. The respondent alleged that since after her marriage with the appellant, the latter was treating her with cruelty and he was pressurising her by making demand for money. She further alleged that the appellant used to abuse, insult and assault her. In this way the parties lived together for a period of 8 years but finally in 1989 the respondent was forced to leave her matrimonial house along with her daughter Pooja and since then she has been residing with her father at Vikhroli, Mumbai. The appellant did not make any provision for maintenance of the respondent and the minor daughter Pooja. He also retained with him the gold ornaments and silver articles which were given to the respondent at the time of her marriage. Finally the respondent filed the above mentioned petition on 11.6.1990 praying for a decree of judicial separation on the ground of cruelty. In addition she prayed for An order of maintenance at the rate of Rs. 3,000/- p.m. for herself and her daughter Pooja. The respondent also made a prayer for return of her ornaments described in the list Exhibit A to the petition. Alternatively she claimed a sum of Rs. 3,25,655/- being the price of the ornaments and the articles in case the same were not restored to her. 3. The appellant resisted the claim of the respondent by filing written statement and denied the factum of marriage with the respondent. According to him he never married with the respondent. He also denied that Pooja was born to the respondent from him. The appellant contended that after the death of his wife Usha, it became necessary to have some person to look after his three children and, therefore, he employed the respondent as a 'caretaker' or governess. The appellant alleged thatRameshchandra Rampratapji Daga vs Rameshwari Rameshchandra Daga on 20 January, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1444799/ 1the respondent's behaviour became cruel and harsh towards his children and that finally the respondent of her own accord left the house along with her valuable articles and cash amount of Rs. 10,000/-. The appellant further contended that the respondent was not entitled to any maintenance since she herself was earning by doing business of L.I.C. agency. The appellant also made a counter-claim and prayed for the decree of nullity on the ground that in case it was held that, that he had married with the respondent, the same was void since the respondent's marriage with Girdharilal Lakhotia was subsisting and same was not dissolved. Therefore, according to him, his marriage, if any, with the respondent, was in contravention of Section 5(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and, hence, it was null and void. 4. In support of her case, the respondent examined herself at Exhibit 60, her father Nandlal Rathi at Exhibit 126, neighbour by name Shrinivas Kalantri at Exhibit 155 and a close relative Ashok Mundada at Exhibit 185. The appellant on the other hand examined himself at Exhibit 157. Both parties led some documentary evidence also. The learned Judge upon consideration of the evidence on record came to the conclusion that the factum of marriage between the parties was proved and that Pooja was born out of the said wedlock. The learned Judge accepted the contention of the respondent about the ill-treatment at the hands of the appellant and held that on that ground she was entitled to a decree of judicial separation. The learned Judge negatived the contention of the appellant about the nullity of the marriage and declined to grant relief of declaration as prayed for by the appellant. He held that the earlier marriage between the respondent and her husband Girdharilal Lakhotia was dissolved by a decree of divorce. The learned Judge further held that the petitioner was entitled to get maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs. 1,000/- p.m. for herself and Rs. 2,000/- p.m. for the minor daughter Pooja from the date of the petition. He further directed the appellant to return to the respondent the articles mentioned in Exhibit A to the petition and in case of his failure to return the same, he directed the appellant to pay to the respondent a sum of Rs. 3,25,655/-. The learned Judge also gave a direction to the appellant to give his No Objection for encashment of Fixed Deposit Receipt dated 13.4.1984. The learned Judge directed the appellant to pay the cost of Rs. 5,000/- to the petitioner and created a charge upon the residential house of the appellant being security of the amount which was payable to the respondent under the decree. 5. We have heard Mr. A.P. Gupte, learned Counsel for the appellant-husband and Mr. Manudhane, learned Counsel for the respondent-wife. We have also gone through the evidence on record. It may be noted that the appellant has disputed the factum of marriage with the respondent and alternatively he has contended that the same is null and void in case it is held to be proved. 6. So far as the factum of marriage is concerned, it is found that there is voluminous evidence to prove that the same was solemnized as averred by the petitioner. Besides the oral evidence of the respondent, her father and neighbour about the solemnization of the marriage, there is documentary evidence in the form of marriage invitation card, photographs and series of correspondence between the parties. Moreover, it is not in dispute that since 1981 the respondent was residing, with the appellant at his house at Ratlam for a period of not less than 8 years. The evidence on record further shows that the appellant treated her as his wife and he was conducting her as such in the community; He attended with her several social functions. According to the appellant he had employed the respondent as a governess of his three children and that she wasRameshchandra Rampratapji Daga vs Rameshwari Rameshchandra Daga on 20 January, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1444799/ 2provided with food and shelter. It is, however, difficult to accept this contention of the appellant for various reasons. It is pertinent to note that the respondent was residing with the appellant in the same house and that during the course of their co-habitation she first gave birth to a stillborn child on 12.4.1982 and thereafter she delivered a female child on 14.7.1983, who was later on named as Pooja. The appellant has also alleged in his written statement that the respondent was living an adulterous life. If that was true then there is no explanation by him as to why he allowed her to stay with him and look after his minor children. In that event he would have driven her out of the house at the first available opportunity. However, it is material to note that when Pooja was admitted in a school, the appellant styled himself as her father. The evidence on record further shows that there, is Fixed Deposit receipt dated 13.4.1985 in the name of the respondent wherein the appellant's name is shown as her husband. The learned trial Judge has taken into consideration all this evidence and rightly arrived at the conclusion that there was a marriage between the appellant and the respondent on 11.7.1981. We do not find any fault with the said finding. 7. The next question which requires to be considered is about the validity of the said marriage. It is pertinent to note that the respondent in her petition initially described herself as a spinster. It was only after the appellant pointed out in his written statement that she had previously married with one Girdharilal Lakhotia, that she got her petition amended suitably by admitting that she had undergone a sort of marriage with the said Girdharilal Lakhotia but the same was not as per the customary rites and it was not a valid marriage. She further averred that she has also filed divorce petition against the said Girdharilal Lakhotia and in that petition there was a settlement, pursuant to which a divorce deed was prepared and got registered. Hence, according to her the marriage between her and the said Girdharilal Lakhotia was not subsisting at the time when she married with appellant on 11.7.1981. We are of the opinion that the respondent ought not to have suppressed the fact of her marriage with the said Girdharilal Lakhotia and it would have been fair on her part if she had, in the first instance, disclosed all the true facts in her petition. 8. It is not now disputed that the respondent had married the said Girdharilal Lakhotia on 19.2.1973 at Amravati. But she has tried to contend that the requisite ceremonies were not performed at the time of the said marriage and there was only garlanding by her and Girdharilal to each other. She further stated that at the time of the said marriage, there was a quarrel between her father and the brother of Girdharilal Lakhotia and as such the rest of the rites could not take place. The respondent, therefore, stated that there was no valid marriage and that she did not admit the same. There is, however, no substance in the contention for the simple reason that if there was no solemnisation of marriage as alleged by her, she would not have gone to the house of the said Girdharilal Lakhotia and stayed with him for about one and half months. It is, therefore, quite obvious that the theory that her marriage with said Girdharilal was not a valid marriage, is only an after-thought with a view to see that the validity of her marriage with the appellant is not in any way affected. 9. The respondent further stated that she had filed a petition for divorce being Petition No. 76 of 1978 against the said Girdharilal Lakhotia in the District Court at Amravati. She explained that she had filed the said petition in order to prevent said Shri Girdharilal from causing obstructions to her marriage with the appellant.

Sandhya Gupta And Anr. vs Saibal Prasad Gupta on 12 May, 1999 Equivalent citations: II (1999) DMC 756, 1999 II OLR 110 Author: P Mohanty Bench: P Naik, P Mohanty JUDGMENT P.K. Mohanty, J. 1. This is an appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act against the order of the learned Judge, Family Court, Rourkela passing a decree for dissolution of the marriage between the appellant No. 1 and the Respondent. 2. Sri K.C. Lenka, learned counsel for the appellants assails the order for dissolution of the marriage inter alia on the ground of maintainability of the petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and on the ground that there was no sufficient material before the learned Judge, Family Court to hold that the appellant-wife was guilty of cruelty towards the husband and that the marriage has become irretrievable. It is his submission that the admitted case of the parties that they being in love, their marriage was registered under the Special Marriage Act at the first instance whereunder it was solemnised at Calcutta in accordance with the Hindu customs and rites, a petition under the Special Marriage Act could only be filed for dissolution of the marriage and as such, the petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not maintainable nor could the learned Judge, Family Court entertain the same. It is further submitted that in view of the pleadings of the parties and on appreciation of the evidence on record, the learned Judge, family Court could not have come to a finding that the petitioner-Respondent had proved mental cruelly against the appellant-wife to call for a dissolution of the marriage. Sri Ashok Mukherjee, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Respondent husband however, contends that the marriage could only be consummated after it was solemnised under the Hindu rules and customs as admitted by both the parties and not after it was registered under the Special Marriage Act and us such, the application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was maintainable and rightly entertained by the learned Judge, Family Court. The learned Senior Counsel has further contended that on a consideration of evidence on record, there being ample evidence to show that the appellant-wife was guilty of cruelly and the marriage and the relationship of the panics had become irretrievable and as such, the decree for divorce is legal and valid. 3. In view of the rival contentions of the teamed counsel for the parties, the question that needs determination is whether a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was maintainable and whether in the (act situation of the case, the finding of the learned Judge, Family Court that the appellant wife was guilty of cruelty, rendering the relationship between the parties and the marriage irretrievable, calling for the extreme order of dissolution of marriage could be sustained in law. 4. The first point raised with regard to the maintainability of the petition in the Court below would not detain us long. The divorce was sought for by the Respondent-husband on the ground of cruelty of the wife as contemplated under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. However, under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act, the marriage thereunder could also be dissolved on the ground of cruelty. The Judge. Family Court under the Family Courts Act, 19-84 is vested with theSmt. Sandhya Gupta And Anr. vs Saibal Prasad Gupta on 12 May, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427143/ 1powers to decide the matrimonial matters both under the Hindu Marriage Act as well as under the Special Marriage Act. The issue, therefore, docs not relate to jurisdiction of the Court, but the applicability of the law to the case and as to whether such an application was maintainable in the facts and circumstances pleaded in the petition. It reveals from the pleadings of the parties and the evidence on record that the marriage was first registered under the Special Marriage Act in 1975 at Calcutta. It further reveals from the pleadings that even though the marriage was registered under the Special Marriage Act, the parties being involved with each other, it could only be consummated after the same was solemnised on 3rd March, 1976 at Barasat in Bihar according to Hindu rites and customs. 5. A petition for divorce can be maintained before the District Judge under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 either by the husband or the wife on the ground that the Respondent since the solemnisation of the marriage has treated the petitioner with cruelty. Such a petition is to be presented before the Judge, Family Court after coming into force of the Family Courts Act. Similarly, under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage, Act, a petition for dissolution of the marriage can be maintained before the Judge, Family Court either by the husband or by the wife on the ground that the other party has after solemnisation of the marriage treated the petitioner with cruelly. In either case, a petition for dissolution of marriage is maintainable before the Judge, Family Court on the ground of cruelty and, therefore, it is not a case, where the Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain and pass a decree, but the question is whether the petition was to be presented under the Hindu Marriage Act or undo the Special Marriage Act. 6. Law is well-settled that filing of a petition mistakenly under a wrong provision of law or giving a wrong nomenclature would not oust the jurisdiction of the Court, if the relief sought in the petition can be granted otherwise under some other provision of law. If the Court was vested with the power to deal with the application and grant relief, only because the application or petition has been filed under a misconception quoting a wrong provision of law, a party cannot be non-suited. 7. A Bench of Calcutta High Court in Prabir Chandra Chatterji v. Kaveri Guha Chatterji, AIR 1987 Cal 191 has taken the view that when the marriage was solemnised in terms of Hindu Marriage Act and, thereafter registered under the Special Marriage Act, it cannot affect the maintainability of the petition for divorce nor the jurisdiction of the Court to grant divorce, if any case therefor is eventually made out. The issue therefore, does not relate to the jurisdiction of the Court or bar of law for maintainability of the petition which is required to be decided. We arc in agreement with the views of the Calcutta High Court in Prabir Chandra Chatterji's case supra. The contention of the appellant to the effect that the petition was not maintainable and as such the decree is a nullity, has to be rejected. In any event, a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty is available to either party to the marriage both under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act as well as Section 27(ii) of the Special Marriage Act and the Judge, Family Court in both the cases had the jurisdiction to decide the matter. Therefore, on a hypertechnical view that the petition having been filed under a wrong provision of law and entertained by the Court will vitiate the proceeding, cannot be accepted. 8. The next point that needs consideration is as to whether, in the fuels and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, the plaintiff has been able to establish that the conduct and actionSmt. Sandhya Gupta And Anr. vs Saibal Prasad Gupta on 12 May, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/427143/ 2of the wife comes within the scope and ambit of ""cruelty"" defined under the Act. The learned Judge, Family Court exhaustively considered the evidence on record and has come to the finding that the appellant-wife is guilty of cruelty and as such has directed dissolution of the marriage. Let us consider the evidence to find out whether or not such a finding is sustainable in law. 9. The Respondent-petitioner in his evidence has stated that their conjugal life was quite happy. Originally, he was at Goa and was subsequently transferred to Calcutta and then to Barasuan. Since there was no schooling facility, their son was being put up in Hotel, but his wife was living at Goa and Calcutta. But after he was transferred to Barasuan, his wife did not agree to come to Barasuan although a suitable quarters was allotted to him. He had to take permission of his authorities to retain the quarters at Calcutta on the ground of his wife's illness. The quarters at Calcutta was retained till the end of March, 1995 with the permission of the authorities, which according to the husband was obtained with much difficulty. On his transfer to Rourkela as Deputy General Manager, he was shifted to Rourkela in the first week of March, 1995 and his belongings were shifted from Calcutta to Rourkela. Inspite of his repeated requests, his wife was not willing to come to Rourkela, for which he had to obtain a declaration from his wife that even if a quarter is allotted to the husband, she is not going to Rourkela on her own accord. It is stated that on 11-3-1995, his wife's two brothers along with the wife of her younger brother came to his official residence at Calcutta and took his wife in an Ambassador Car with all her belongings and belongings of his son saying that she was feeling insecured with his company. He felt seriously for such objectionable attitude. On 12-3-1995, he went to the residence of his brother-in-law and requested his wife to join the matrimonial home, but he was misbehaved by them and his wife shouted at him. On 15-6-1995, which was the 1st day of Baisakh, he requested his wife to stay with him but she did not agree. In spite of several letters to the wife requesting her to come to Rourkela and join the matrimonial home, she did not respond. On 5-5-1996, his wife and son came to Rourkela since his son was to appear at an examination and they left Rourkela on 10-5-1996. It is stated by the husband, P.W. 1 that till then he was meeting all the expenses by kind and by cash for his wife and son. His repeated persuasion to his wife to join the matrimonial home at Rourkela was of no effect. Again in August, 21, 1995, his wife, son and his wife's brother came to his residence at Rourkela when all his three brothers and two sisters persuaded his wife and requested her to join the matrimonial home, so that he would live happily, but it was of no effect. On 23rd August, 1995 his wife did not enter into his room making wild allegations that some other lady was with him and his wife, son and her brother took rest in the Drawing Room. It is stated that all the times his wife was making allegations against him that he was a womaniser and drunkard. Not only that, she also did not hesitate to make such complaint before the husband's official head, the Director. In the meantime, he received a caveat notice from the Court of Additional District Judge, Barasat bearing Caveat No. 539 of 1995, which was received on or about 24-9-1995, From 27-8-1995 there was no talk between him and his wife nor any correspondence. It is stated that he filed this case for dissolution of the marriage, so that his wife may stop making any allegations against him before anybody imputing his character. It is further stated that he heard that his wife has made application to his head of office for monetary help which has hurt his feelings. In cross-examination, P.W. 1, the husband has said that their conjugal life was very peaceful, till 1995. His wife was not separated till 27-8-1995. He has further stated that Lipika Roy is the wife of late Tarunkanti Roy, who was his friend and was murdered at Goa and, therefrom, a compassionate appointment was given to Lipika by the Company in January,Smt.

164,"Kerala High Court Karthi Pankajakshy vs Lalitha Sujatha on 16 January, 1990 Equivalent citations: II (1990) DMC 100 Author: Manoharan Bench: Manoharan JUDGMENT Manoharan, J. 1. This appeal is by the first respondent in A.S. 153/1983 of the District Court, Trivandrum who was the first defendant in O S. 88 of 1988 of the Munsiffs Court. The suit was one for partition and allotment of the plaintiffs 1/11th share in A schedule property and 1/11th share in the one-half of plaint B schedule property. The suit was dismissed by the trial court, against which the first respondent preferred A.S. 153 of 1983 before the District Court, Trivandrum. The District Court allowed the appeal and passed a preliminary decree for partition declaring that, the first respondent is entitled to 1/10 share in the plaint A schedule property and 1/10 in the one-half of the plaint B schedule property. Though the share claimed in the plaint is 1/11, the lower appellate court passed a preliminary decree for 1/10 share. Para 11 of the lower court's judgment states that, since the first respondent has applied for amending the plaint stating that the 8th respondent is not entitled to any share the appellant is entitled to 1/10. The judgment does not say that, the application for amendment was allowed; no order is seen to have been passed on I.A. 315/1984 filed for the said purpose. 2. The first respondent's case in brief was that, herself and respondents 9 and 10 are the children of deceased Bhaskaran through his second wife, the 8th respondent. The appellant is the first wife of deceased Bhaskaran and respondents 2 to 7 are her children. The appellant, contested the suit. She denied the marriage between Bhaskaran and the 8th respondent. She also denied the claim that, the 1st respondent and respondents 9 and 10 are the children of Bhaskaran. 3. It is admitted that, the appellant is the widow of deceased Bhaskaran, and respondents 2 to 7 are his children born to the appellant. Plaint A schedule was obtained by deceased Bhaskaran as per Ext. A1 gift deed, and B schedule was obtained under Ext. A2 sale deed which stands in the name of Bhaskaran and his wife, the appellant. 4. No where in the plaint is there an allegation as to when Bhaskaran died. The date of death of Bhaskaran is relevant in deciding as to whether the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act govern the succession to his estate, Even paragraph 9 of the plaint which contains the allegation regarding the cause of action does not mention the date of death of Bhaskaran. Since Ext. A2 sale deed in favour of Bhaskaran and the appellant was in 1962, he could have died only after 1962. PW-1 said that Bhaskaran died 18 years ago. She was examined on 6-10 1982. Therefore Bhaskaran should have died in 1964. Consequently, the pro visions of Hindu Succession Act applies. 5. Since the status of the first respondent and respondents 8 to 10 are denied, the burden of proof is on those respondents to establish that they are the legal heirs of deceased Bhaskaran. Though the first respondent swears, that the 8th respondent was married by Bhaskaran; even according to her the 8th respondent is the second wife of Bhaskaran. Evidence regarding the said marriage is theKarthi Pankajakshy vs Lalitha Sujatha on 16 January, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153817/ 1deposition of PWs. 1 and 2, and Exts. A3 and A4. The statements in Exts. A3 and A4 are relied on to substantiate the claim that deceased Bhaskaran had married the 8th respondent, and respondents 1, 9 and 10 are his children born to the 8th respondent. PW-1 being the daughter, cannot have any direct knowledge regarding the marriage. The evidence of PW-2 was not accepted by the trial court, and the first appellate court also does not make reliance on his evidence. PW-2 said that, there are records in the S.N.D.P. Branch to evidence the marriage of Bhaskaran with 8th respondent. He also said that, the Secretary and the President of the S N.D.P. Branch were present at the marriage and they are alive. Neither the said records were summoned, nor the said persons were examined. The trial court was not prepared to act upon the statements in Exts. A3 and A4 as evidence of marriage; but the first appellate court relied on the statements in Exts. A3 and A4 to find that the 8th respondent was married by deceased Bhaskaran. 6. Ext. A3 is a gift deed executed by the deceased father of Bhaskaran in favour of the first respondent and respondents 9 and 10. In Ext. A3 the deceased father of Bhaskaran described 8th respondent as the second wife of Bhaskaran and respondents 1, 9 and 10 his children through the 8th respondent. Since the father of Bhaskaran is no more, the aforesaid statement is relevant under Section 32(5) of the Evidence Act. Ext. A4 is a partition deed entered into by the mother of deceased Bhaskaran, her daughters, the appellant and the 8th respondent. The appellant did not sign Ext. A4, but the deceased mother of Bhaskaran and his sisters have signed the document. Though Ext. A4 may not be binding on the appellant since she did not affix her signature, it cannot be said that the statements therein can be ignored. The mother of Bhaskaran is alive and the appellate judgment states that though the appellant cited her as a witness, she did not examine her inspite of the fact that she was present in court. Since the mother of Bhaskaran was alive and was available for examination, the aforesaid statement in Ext. A4 cannot be admitted in evidence under Section 32 of the Evidence Act. But such statement if properly proved, can be admitted in evidence under Section 50 of the Evidence Act. As already indicated, the statement made by the father of Bhaskaran in Ext. A3 has to be given due weight. On the strength of the statement in Ext. A3 even if it is presumed that Bhaskaran married the 8th respondent, that by itself cannot confer legitimacy to respondents 1, 9 and 10 because even according to the first respondent, the 8th respondent was only the second wife of Bhaskaran. 7. The definition of ""related"" in Section 2(j) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 limits the meaning to legitimate kinship. Section 2(j) reads :-- ""2(j) ""related"" means by legitimate kinship : Provided that illegitimate children shall be deemed to be related to their mother and to one another, and their legitimate descendants shall be deemed to be related to them and to one another; and any word expressing relationship or denoting a relative shall be construed accordingly"". 8. The proviso expands the definition. By virtue of the proviso illegitimate children can be regarded as related to the mother but not to their putative father. Therefore, if the marriage between the 8th respondent and deceased Bhaskaran was not a valid marriage, the children born to Bhaskaran in the 8th respondent would not be entitled to inherit him as illegitimate children are not entitled toKarthi Pankajakshy vs Lalitha Sujatha on 16 January, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153817/ 2inherit their father as per the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. As per Section 6 of the Ezhava Act 1100 when a marriage is solemnized during the subsistance of a prior marriage, the said marriage would be void; and Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 5(1) also is to the same effect. Therefore, the children born to Bhaskaran in the 8th respondent are not legitimate as per the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. But it is contended that, by virtue of Section 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, they are legitimate for the purpose of succession to the estate of their parents. Reliance was placed on the decision reported in Janu v. Yesoda, 1989 (1) KLT 329 in support of the said argument. 9. It is now necessary to understand the scope of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads : ""16. (1) Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. (2) Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made, who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date of the decree it had been dissolved instead of being annulled, shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of nullity. (3) Nothing contained in Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents"". It is clear from Sub-section (1) of Section 16 that children born of a marriage which is void under Section 11 would be legitimate; but as per Sub-section (3) they cad inherit only their parents. Section 16(1) of the said Act can apply only if the marriage in void under Section 11 of the said Act. Section 11 reads :-- ""11. Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, against the other party be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Class (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5"". 10. It is clear on a reading of the said Section that the same will apply only to marriages that are solemnized after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act. Thus, Section 16(1) of the said Act will not assist children born of all void marriages; it will assist only children born of marriages voidKarthi Pankajakshy vs Lalitha Sujatha on 16 January, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153817/ 3","['6', '16', '12','5', '2', '11']"
165,"Delhi High Court Chander Dev Chad vs Rani Bala on 25 April, 1978 Equivalent citations: AIR 1979 Delhi 22, ILR 1978 Delhi 331 Author: A Rohatgi Bench: V Misra, A B Rohatgi JUDGMENT A.B. Rohatgi, J. (1) These are three appeals under the Hindu Marriage Act. F.A.O. 20 of 1973 is wife's appeal against the decree of divorce passed in favor of the husband. F.A.O. 13 of 1978 is the husband's appeal against the decree refusing him restitution of conjugal rights. F.A.O. 14 of 1978 is again a husband's appeal against an order denying him custody of children. (2) The question before us is whether these appeals are barred by time. The Registry has raised an objection that they are out of time. (3) In all three cases the appeallants applied for certified copy of the judgment, decree or order passed by the trial court as was the case. After they had obtained these they filed appeals. If the time requisite for obtaining the copy of the decree or order is excluded. the appeals were filed within 30 days and are well within time; but if in law it could not be excluded, the appeals would certainly be out of time. The respondents contend before us that the appellants are not entitled in law to exclude the time so taken by them in obtaining a copy of the decree or order of the trial court. The only question, therefore, is whether for the purpose of computing the period of 30 days prescribed under s. 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act the provisions of s. 12 of the Limitation Act can be invoked. (4) The respondents' chief objection in liming is that under s. 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act an appeal has to be preferred within 30 days from the date of the decree or order and the Limitation Act 1963 does not apply to marriage and divorce laws, therefore, the appellants are not entitled to exclude the period spent in obtaining copies. Unhindered by authority we were minded to rebuff this objection by a simple answer. We would say that if Limitation Act 1963 did not apply to the Hindu Marriage Act s. 3 of the Limitation Act also would not apply. By what authority would a court then dismiss an appeal preferred after the prescribed period of 30 days ? Now the result would be that although an appeal may be barred by limitation it would not be liable to be dismissed under s. 3 Limitation Act. We thought such was the incontestable logic of the argument. (See Canara Bank. Bombay Vs. Warden Insurance Co. Ltd., Bombay ). (5) But counsel for the respondents invited our attention to a decision of a learned single judge of this Court in Smt. Tara Seth v. Shri Dharamvir Seth, Fao 100 of 1977 decided on 3-1-1978(2). There it was held that Limitation Act 1963 did not apply to the Hindu Marriage Act by reason of the provision contained in subsection (3) of s. 29 of the Limitation Act and therefore the appeal had to be filed within 30 days. The wife was held not entitled to invoke the provisions of s. 12(2) and s. 5 of Limitation Act. Her appeal, which was otherwise within time if days spent in obtaining copies had been excluded, was dismissed as time-barred. It is the correctness of this view that is challenged before us by the appellants.Chander Dev Chad vs Rani Bala on 25 April, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1900935/ 1(6) The two material provisions we may notice at once. One is sec. 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act which says : ""Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of decree or order."" The other is s. 29(2) and (3) of the Limitation Act 1963 which reads : ""29. (1)....... (2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit. appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only in so far as, and to extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. (3) Save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any such law. (4) (7) Under the Indian Divorce Act. 1869, the remedy to obtain relief in matrimonial causes is by way of suit. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the remedy is by a petition,. Under both Acts the court is empowered to pass decrees. In matters regarding maintenance, alimony, or custody of children etc. the court is empowered to pass orders. (8) Now sub-sec. (3) of s. 29 of the Limitation Act says that nothing in the Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce. What does it mean ? It means that to original proceedings under the Indian Divorce Act, the Hindu Marriage Act, and other Acts like the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act and the Special Marriage Act the Limitation Act does not apply. For example there is no limitation for bringing a suit for divorce under the Indian Divorce Act or for a proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act (9) Under the Limitation Acts Ix of 1871 and Xiv of 1859 where there was no such provision and under the Limitation Act of 1908 where an analogous provision existed but confined only to suits under the Indian Divorce Act, in was held that the limitation law did not apply to suits under the Indian Divorce Act. (See A V B (1898) 22 Born. 612(616, 617(3) (DB). The reason is obvious These are continuing wrongs (See s. 23 Limitation Act 1908). Refusal of a wife to return to her husband was held to constitute a continuing wrong. Hem Chand v. Shiv (1892) 16 Born. 715(4) Fukerganda A v. Ganga (1899) 23 Born. 307(5). Similarly, a suit between Muhammadans. Hindus or Parsis for restitution of conjugal rights was saved from the bar of limitation by s. 23 of the Act of 1908 and such suits could never practically be barred : (See Binda v. Kaunsila (1891) 13 All. 126(6) : Basawaneva v. Balappa (1935) 38 Born. L. R. 502(7). Thus suits brought under the Indian Divorce Act (i.e. as between Christians) were and are expressly excluded from the operation of the Limitation laws; See s. 29(3) of the Limitation Act (Act Ix of 1908) and s. 29(3) of the Act xxxvi of 1963). (10) Under the Limitation Acts of 1859 and 1871 it was held that though the Act was inapplicable, delay in presenting or prosecuting a petition for dissolution of marriage under the Divorce Act was a ground for disallowing the petition. There is a similar provision in the Hindu Marriage Act where delay is made a ground for refusal of relief (see s. 23(d). But the objection on the ground of delay would not hold good in cases where the marriage was ab initio void (See Mills v. Mills (1901) Cal W. N. (8) Civ. in the Probate and Divorce Court).Chander Dev Chad vs Rani Bala on 25 April, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1900935/ 2(11) S. 29 Cl. 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908, provided that ""nothting in the Limitation Act small apply to suits under the Indian Divorce Act. 1869"". Suit does not include an appeal (See Sec. 2(10) of the Limitation Act 1908 and 2(1) of Limitation Act 1963). The courts held under the Ac; of 1908 that this prohibition was restricted only to suits and did not extend to appeals (See A. V. B. (Supra). 12. In the Limitation Act, 1963, the provisions of the Act of 1908 have been broadened so as to include other laws. There are a number of such Acts like the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, the Special Marriage Act, the Hindu Marriage Act and the Dissolution of Muslims Marriages Act dealing with marriage and divorce. On the recommendation of the Law Commission the present sub-section (3) has amplified section 29(3) of the Act of 1908 so as to exclude the application of the Limitation Law to suits or proceedings under any law dealing with marriage and divorce. The term ""suit"" or ""proceeding"" means suits under the Divorce Act and petitions for dissolution of marriage or for judicial separation or for declaration of nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights or for any other relief under the Hindu Marriage Act. (12) The Limitation Act, 1963, is inapplicable to original proceedings. But appeals from decrees in suits under the Indian Divorce Act and appeals from decrees and orders under the Hindu Marriage Act are not excluded from the operation of the Indian Limitation Act. Section 55 of the Divorce Act 1869 places appeals from such decrees under the laws in force for every original side decree. Such appeals are, therefore, governed now by Article 117 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In the case of Hindu Marriage Act appeals are provided by the special law itself, that is, s. 28(4). And by reason of s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act 1963 sections 3 and 4 to 24 thereof shall apply. The law may therefore be stated thus. The prohibition contained in s. 29(3) Limitation Act 1963 is restricted only to suits and proceedings and hence does not extend to appeals. (13) But the question we posed at the beginning remains unanswered. Will the period spent in obtaining copies be excluded under s. 12(2) Limitation Act, 1963 ? The answer is 'yes'. The answer is given in s. 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963, which we have set out above. (14) The Hindu Marriage Act is a special law. That this ""special law"" prescribes ""for an appeal a period of limitation"" is also evident. The period of limitation is 30 days. It is a period different from that prescribed in the first schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963. But when we turn to the First Schedule we find there is no provision in the first schedule for an appeal against the decree or order passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. Now it has been held that the test of a ""prescription of a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the first schedule"" as laid down in s. 29(2) Limitation Act, 1963 is satisfied even in a case where a difference between the special law and Limitation Act arose by omissions to provide for a limitation to a particular proceeding under the Limitation Act, see Canara Bank Bombay v. Warden Insurance Co. Ltd. Bombay (Supra) approved by the Supreme Court in Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand, . Once the test is satisfied the provisions of ss. 3, 4 to 24 Limitation Act, 1963 would at once apply to the special law. The result is that the court hearing the appeal from the decree or order passed under the Hindu Marriage Act would under s. 3 of the Limitation Act have power to dismiss the appeal if made after the period of limitation of 30 days prescribed therefore by the special law. Similarly under s. 5 for sufficient cause it will have the power to condone delay. Likewise under s. 12(2) the time spent I in obtaining a certified copy of the decree or order appealed from will be excluded.

166,"Madhya Pradesh High Court Kantibai vs Kamal Singh Thakur on 2 May, 1978 Equivalent citations: AIR 1978 MP 245 Author: Verma Bench: A Sen, J Verma JUDGMENT Verma, J. 1. By our order dated 13-4-1978, we have allowed the application made by the appellant under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, for condonation of the delay in filing this appeal. While doing so, in that order we had stated that the reasons for holding that Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 applies also to appeals filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as amended by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act No, 68 of 1976), will be given later. Accordingly, we are now stating the reasons for taking this view. 2. Shri V.S. Shroti, learned counsel for the respondent, placing reliance on Hukumdev Narain v. Lalit Narain, AIR 1974 SC 480 contended that the different limitation of thirty days prescribed in Sub-section (4) of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, as a result of the Amendment Act No. 68 of 1976, excluded the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1%3 to appeals filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, by virtue of Sub-section, (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In reply, Shri A.K. Khaskalam, learned counsel for the appellant, placed reliance on Mangu Ram v. Delhi Municipality, AIR 1976 SC 105 to contend that Section 5 of the Limitation Act applies to such appeals, because provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) of the Limitation Act, 1963, are made expressly applicable by Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and that there is no express exclusion of the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, by the special Act, viz.Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as amended by Act No. 68 of 1976. 3. Under the Limitation Act of 1908, Section 29 thereof did not expressly apply Section 5 of that Act as it did Section 4, Sections 9 to 18 and Section 22 of that Act unless they were expressly excluded by any special or local law, to a case where a different limitation was prescribed by any special or local law and it was also stated that the remaining provisions of that Act shall not apply to such cases. On the contrary, Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1963 expressly applies Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) in all such cases unless their application is expressly excluded by any such special or local law. The departure is clear and unequivocal inasmuch as Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is now ordinarily applicable to all such cases, unless there is express exclusion of its application in such cases by the special or local law. The scope of Section 5 as enacted in Limitation Act, 1963, is also wider than the corresponding provision in the Limitation Act of 1908. The result is that ordinarily Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, must be held applicable even where Section 29 of the Act is attracted, there being a different limitation prescribed by any special or local law and the applicability of Section 5 can be excluded in such cases only when it is found that it has been expressly excluded by such special or local law. The conclusion would depend on the result of an enquiry made in this manner. Before examining the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, as amended by the Amendment Act No. 68 of 1976, we may refer to the principles laid down in the two decisions relied on from both sides.Kantibai vs Kamal Singh Thakur on 2 May, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889653/ 14. In Mangu Ram v. Delhi Municipality (AIR 1976 SC 105) (supra) the question was whether Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 applied to an application for special leave made under Section 417(3) of the Cr. P. C. 1898, in view of the imperative language used while prescribing a different limitation of sixty days in Sub-sec. (4) of Section 417, Cr. P. C. Their Lordships, after examining the scheme of Section 29 of the Limitation Act of 1963, held that even though Section 29(2) was attracted to that case and the language in Sub-section (4) of Section 417 of the Cr. P. C., 1898 was mandatory and compulsive, yet Section 5 of the Limitation Act must apply to that case. Their Lordships, in taking that view, stated as under (at p. 108):-- ""There is an important departure made by the Limitation Act, 1963 in so far as the provision contained in Section 29, Sub-section (2) is concerned. Whereas under the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, Section 29, Sub-section (2), Clause (b) provided that for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, other than those contained in Sections 4, 9 to 18 and 22, shall not apply and, therefore, the applicability of Section 5 was in clear and specific terms excluded. Section 29, Sub-section, (2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 enacts in so many terms that for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24, which would include Section 5, shall apply in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. Section 29, Sub-section (2), Clause (b) of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 specifically excluded the applicability of Section 5, while Section 29, Sub-section, (2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 in clear and unambiguous terms provided for the applicability of Section 5, Since under the Limitation Act, 1963, Section 5 is specifically made applicable by Section 29 Sub-section, (2), it can be availed of for the purpose of extending the period of limitation prescribed by a special or local law if the applicant can show that he had sufficient cause for not presenting the application within the period at limitation, It is only if the special or local law expressly excludes the applicability of Section 5, that it would stand displaced. Here, as pointed out by this Court in Kaushalya Rani's case AIR 1964 SC 260 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 152 the time limit of sixty days laid down in Sub-section (4) of Section 417 is a special law of limitation and we do not find anything in this special law which expressly excludes the applicability of Section 5, It is true that the language of Sub-section (4) of Section 417 is mandatory and compulsive, in that it provides in no uncertain terms that no application for grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of sixty days from the date of that order of acquittal. But that would be the language of every provision prescribing a period of limitation. It is because a bar against entertainment of an application beyond the period of limitation is created by a special or local law that it becomes necessary to invoke the aid of Section 5 in order that the application may be entertained despite such bar. Mere provision of a period of limitation in howsoever peremptory or imperative language is not sufficient to displace the applicability of Section 5."" Thus, it was clearly held that mere peremptory or imperative language of the provision in the special law prescribing a different limitation, does not exclude the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, without anything more expressly excluding its applicability.Kantibai vs Kamal Singh Thakur on 2 May, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889653/ 25. In Hukumdev Narain Yadav v. La-lit Narain Mishra (AIR 1974 SC 480) (supra) their Lordships were dealing with the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to an election petition filed under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Their Lordships reiterated the view taken earlier in Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand Baghel, AIR 1964 SC 1099: (1964) 6 SCR 129) and D. P. Mishra v, Kamal Narayan Sharma, AIR 1970 SC 1477. In Vidyacharan's case, it was held that Section 12 of the Limitation Act, 1908, applied to an election appeal filed under Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. In D. P. Mishra's case, it was held that Section 12 of the Limitation Act, 1963, applied to an election appeal filed under Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, Their Lordships in Hukumdev's case (supra) summarised the ratio of these two decisions as under (at p. 1480):-- ""Following the decision in Vidyacharan Shukla's case this Court held, that Sections 4 and 12 of the Limitation Act would apply, because ""There is no provision in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which excludes the application of Section 4 of the Limitation Act'"". Thus, applicability of Sections 4 and 12 of the Limitation Act, both old as well as new, to an appeal filed under Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, was reiterated by their Lordships and they then proceeded to examine whether Section 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to an election petition filed under Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in view of the nature of right and the scheme of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, In this connection, their Lordships examined the scope of Section 5 and Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, both old as well as new, and pointed out that the new Section 5 is now of wider applicability. On an examination of the scheme of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, it was held that the Act was a self-contained Code and the provisions thereof read harmoniously, clearly indicated that the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, to an election petition was necessarily excluded/ Reliance was placed by their Lordships, inter alia, on Section 86 ""of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which contains peremptory command to the High Court to dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of Sections 81, 83 or 117. It was also pointed out that Sub-section (5) of Section 86 while giving latitude to the petitioner to amend the particulars of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition, also laid down that the High Court shall not allow a new corrupt practice to be pleaded by amendment after expiry of the limitation prescribed for filing an election petition. It was, therefore, in the scheme of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which was held to be a self-contained Code conferring the right itself to file an election petition and regulating the exercise of that right that it was held that the applicability of Section 5 was necessarily excluded by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, read as a whole. It was pointed out that the right to file an election petition being itself conferred by the statute and the same not being a common law right, the statute itself must give the discretion to condone the delay. The ratio of that decision only is that even if the special law does not contain express words of exclusion, the nature of right and scheme of the special law must be examined to find out if they are inconsistent with these provisions of the Limitation Act, so that the latter are 'necessarily excluded', and if that conclusion is reached, then the particular provision of the Limitation Act which is so inconsistent, must be held to be excluded by virtue of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963.Kantibai vs Kamal Singh Thakur on 2 May, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889653/ 3","['4', '22', '12', '5', '28', '29', '11']"
167,"Madhya Pradesh High Court Laxmansingh Chandrasingh vs Kesharbai Laxmansingh on 30 January, 1963 Equivalent citations: AIR 1966 MP 166 Bench: V Newaskar, P Tare ORDER 1. This appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is by the plaintiff-husband against the decree, dated 23rd August 1961 passed by Shri P. V. Muzumdar, First Additional District Judge, Indore, in Civil Suit No. 22 of 1960 dismissing the petitioner's claim for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Act. 2. The appellant had presented his petition in the Court of the District Judge who, however, transferred the case for trial to the Court of the First Additional District Judge, Indore, in pursuance of a distribution memo dated 1st January 1960. The appellant sought restitution of conjugal rights on the allegation that the respondent had been married to him on 18th June 1941 and that she had left her husband's house some time in the year 1959 without any reasonable cause. It was also alleged that there were five issues born to the parties after the marriage. 3. The respondent denied that she was the married wife of the appellant. She also alleged that she feared physical injury at the hands of the appellant. She further alleged that the appellant's married wife lives with him in his own house. 4. The trial Judge held that the respondent had been the petitioner's keep and that at no time a marriage according to the caste custom was performed. In that view the petitioner was held disentitled to claim restitution of conjugal rights. 5. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the Additional District Judge had no jurisdiction to try a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It was pointed out that as per Section 3(b) of the Act, 'District Court' means in any area for which there is a city civil court, that court, and in any other area the principal civil court of original jurisdiction, and includes any other civil court which may be specified by the State Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in this Act. It was further pointed out that the present petition had been filed on 25th July 1960 while the State Government had issued a notification No. 36802-11386-XXI.B dated, 7th December 1960 published in Madhya Pradesh Gazette, dated 23rd December 1960, part 1, page 1936 under Section 3(b) of the Act empowering all the Courts of Additional District Judges to try cases under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It was suggested that as such the subsequent authorization by the State Government could not empower the First Additional District Judge, Indore, to try cases retrospectively. 6. So far as empowering by the State Government under Section 3(b) of the Act is concerned, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is not without substance. It is true that the notification has not the effect of empowering the Additional District judges to try cases retrospectively. However, that is not the end of the matter.Laxmansingh Chandrasingh vs Kesharbai Laxmansingh on 30 January, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/348775/ 17. Section 19 of the Act requires that every petition under this Act shall be presented to the district court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnized or the husband and the wife reside or last resided together. Further on, Section 21 of the Act provides that subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. By virtue of Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the State Government may have been authorized to empower the courts of the Additional District Judges to try cases under the Act. But by virtue of the fact that the Court trying a case under the Hindu Marriage Act is a civil Court to which the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code are applicable except to the extent as are modified by the specific provisions of the Act, we hare to take into consideration the provisions of the Madh. Pradesh Civil Courts Act. 1958, Section 3 of the said Act classified the different Courts as under :--  ""(i)  The   Court   of     the   District     Judge;   (ii)  the   Court   of   the   Additional   District Judge;   (iii) the Court of the Civil Judge (Class I); and    (iv) the Court of the Civil Judge (Class II)."" Further on, Section 7 of the said Act provides as under :--    "" The Court of the District Judge shall be the Principal Civil Court     of original jurisdiction in the civil district,  (2) An additional District Judge shall discharge any of the functions of a District Judge, including the functions of the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, which the District Judge may by general or special order assign to him and in the discharge of such functions he shall exercise the same powers as the District Judge."" 8. The provision in Section 7(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1958 is on the same lines as Section 23 of the Madhya Bharat Civil Courts Act 1949 and as such altogether different from the provisions of the C.P. Civil Courts Act, 1917. Under the C. P. Act the Court of the Additional District Judge was not a separate entity but a part and parcel of the district court. The additional Judge was merely additional to the court of the District Judge. But, under the present Act the Court of the Additional District Judge is a separate entity from that of the Court of the District Judge. However, the Court of the Additional District Judge can perform all the functions of a principal civil Court of original jurisdiction in case it is so empowered in that behalf by the District Judge by way of a general or a special order. In the instant case, the District Judge, Indore by a distribution memo, dated, 1st of January 1960 had empowered the First Additional District Judge, Indore to try all cases under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This power conferred by Section 7 (2) of the Madhya Pradesh CivilLaxmansingh Chandrasingh vs Kesharbai Laxmansingh on 30 January, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/348775/ 2Courts Act, 1958 is in addition to the power conferred on the State Government by virtue of Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Therefore, so far as the Additional District Judges in a Civil district are concerned, they can certainly be empowered to perform the functions of a principal civil Court of original jurisdiction if they are so empowered by a general or a special order of the District Judge. We are of opinion that the objection of the appellant that the First Additional District Judge, Indore had no jurisdiction to try the suit is without any substance, whatsoever. In this connection we might mention the case of Dharam Sheela Bai Ram Dayal v. Ram Dayal Bhatnagar, 1961 M. P. LJ 979 ; (1961 (2) Cri LJ 236) decided by Khan and Shiv Dayat JJ. holding that the Additional District Judge can perform the functions of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in case he is so empowered by a general, or special order issued by the District Judge under Section 7 (2) of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1958. We are in agreement with the view expressed by our learned brothers. The case of Janak Dulari v. Narain Dass AIR 1959 Punj 50 relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant is clearly distinguishable on the ground that the provisions of the Punjab Courts Act are slightly different and. the view taken by the learned Judge turned on the special provisions of that Act. This was what the learned Judge observed :-- ""It is also laid down that the Court of Additional District Judge is not a division Court of the Court of District Judge. Thus the Punjab Courts Act does not contemplate a Court of Additional District Judge. The Court of Additional District Judge, therefore, cannot be considered to be a Civil Court of original jurisdiction under the Hindu Marriage Act particularly when Section 20 lays down that there shall be only one District Judge in each district and Section 24 provides that the Court of District Judge shall be deemed to be district Court or principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district. It is true that under Section 21(2) an Additional Judge is authorised to discharge the functions of a District Judge and in the discharge of these functions he exercises the same powers as the District Judge but this section does not refer to a Court of Additional District Judge and the Supreme Court has held that the Court of Additional Judge is a distinct Court. Speaking for myself I always consider the Court of Additional District Judge to be a Court of Additional Judge under the Punjab Courts Act and that when a case was transferred to it by the District Judge then the Additional District Judge exercised the same powers as the District Judge as provided in Section 21 (2) of the Punjab Courts Act.  In  view  of      some observations  of  the Supreme Court, I      feel some    difficulty in considering  this   position to  be  correct.    The matter is important and in my opinion it should be decided by a larger Bench""    This order of reference was made by a Single Judge and the reference came up for hearing before a Division Bench.   9. It is pertinent to note the provisions of Section 21 of the Punjab Courts Act (No. 6 of 1918).

168,"Calcutta High Court Subir Kumar Kundu Alias Sambhu vs State Of West Bengal on 19 December, 1990 Equivalent citations: 1992 CriLJ 1502 Author: A Bhattacharjee Bench: A Bhattacharjee, A N Ray JUDGMENT A.M. Bhattacharjee, J. 1. The accused-petitioner was convicted by the trial Court under Section 494 of the Penal Code for committing the offence of bigamy and the conviction and also the sentence imposed by the trial Court have been affirmed in appeal. Mr. Balai Roy, the learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner, has assailed the conviction mainly on two grounds, the first being that the alleged second marriage has not been proved as the essential ceremonies required for its solemnisation have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the second being that various circumstances relied on by the trial Court in support of the conviction were not put to the accused in his examination under Section 313 of the Criminal P.C. 2. At least from 1869 when the Privy Council decided Inderun v. Ramaswamy, 13 Moere's Indian Appeals 141, the law appears to be well-settled (at 158) for more than a century that ""if there was a marriage in fact, there would be a presumption in favour of there being a marriage in law"". In 1911, the Privy Council again declared in Mouji Lal v. Chandrabati, ILR 38 Calcutta 700 at 707, that to ""matters of form and ceremony, the established presumption in favour of marriage undoubtedly applies"". In 1947, the Privy Council in Kashi Nath v. Bhagwan Das AIR 1947 Privy Council 168, referred to and reaffirmed what it declared in Inderun (supra). And in 1962, the Supreme Court in Veerappa v. Michael, , referred to Mouji Lal (supra) and ruled that ""where it is proved that the marriage was performed in fact, the Court will also presume that the necessary ceremonies have been performed"". 3. This impressive array of binding authorities should lead one to conclude that in any proceeding involving the question relating to the validity of a marriage in the sense as to whether the ceremonies necessary to constitute the marriage were performed, the proof of the fact of going through a form of marriage would lead to the presumption that the ceremonies necessary to constitute such marriage were also performed. One would have also been inclined to think that there should be no good reasons as to why such a presumption cannot be raised and acted upon in prosecutions for bigamy also. 4. Mr. Roy has, however, urged that in a prosecution for bigamy, the provide to Section 50 of the Evidence Act would repel the operation of such presumption. But all that the said Proviso provides is that in a prosecution for bigamy under Sections 494 and 495, Penal Code, the opinion of others, expressed by conduct, shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage. Ex facie, at least, we find nothing in Section 50, Evidence Act or in the proviso thereto to militate or to have any thing to do against any presumption as to the due observance of forms and ceremonies arising from the proof of performance of a marriage in fact. And if the Court, will have to presume due observance of forms and performance of ceremonies, then one would have thought further that the Court will have to regard such observance and performance as proved, unless they are disproved by evidence inSubir Kumar Kundu Alias Sambhu vs State Of West Bengal on 19 December, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102806/ 1accordance with the principles enacted in the definition of ""shall presume"" in Section 4 of the Evidence Act. 5. Mr. Roy has, however, urged that such a presumption is nevertheless impermissible in a prosecution for bigamy and has contended that the matter appears to be concluded by a series of Supreme Court decisions and also by the decisions of our Court following them. 6. It is not, as it cannot be, the law that a criminal conviction solely on the basis of permissible legal presumption is illegal and convictions grounded solely on such presumption have been upheld by the Privy Council, the Supreme Court and the High Courts times without number. Under the law there is a permissible presumption -- vide, Section 114(a), Evidence Act -- that a person found to be in possession of recently stolen articles is, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, either the thief or has received the articles knowing them to be stolen. And in Otto George Gefller v. King (AIR 1943 Privy Council 211 at 214), the Privy Council ruled that an accused could legally be held to be guilty on such presumption. This decision has been relied on by the Supreme Court in Karnel Singh v. State of Maharashtra, and in Nagappa Dondiba v. State of Karnataka, the Supreme Court has again upheld the conviction under Section 411, Penal Code on the basis of such presumption. 7. No one would ever doubt the legality of a conviction solely on the basis of circumstantial evidence. But is not circumstantial evidence, in effect, presumption and suppositions and inferences from circumstances ? As pointed out in Halsbury's Laws of England, (3rd Edition, Volume 15, page 263), facts which lead to a conclusion necessary to prove or disprove a fact in issue may be established directly or by inference and ""evidence of facts which inferentially leads to such a conclusion is described as presumptive or circumstantial"" Circumstantial evidence is nothing but evidence of some facts, other than the fact in issue, leading to a presumption or inference of the principal fact, (Sarkar on Evidence, 13th Edition, Volume 1, page 37). Sometimes, circumstantial evidence is treated as a genus with 'presumptive evidence' as a species, the other species being labelled as 'conclusive evidence'; but both are presumptive with variation in degree. 8. That presumption in favour of everything necessary to validate a marriage has always been regarded by the Courts to be of exceptional strength would also appear from the old decision of this Court in Lopez v. Lopez, (ILR 12 Calcutta 706 at 732), and the Courts have virtually issued a self-imposed command to themselves to the effect that ""the Court will presume"" due performance of all requisite ceremonies from the circumstances of a marriage in fact. And, as already indicated, one would have thought that, there should be nothing in law to prevent a conviction for bigamy on such a finding as to a marriage being valid in form from the proof of its celebration in fact. But notwithstanding all these, the contention of Mr. Roy that a conviction for bigamy cannot be sustained on such presumption alone and must fail unless the observance of the requisite form and performance of the necessary ceremonies are affirmatively proved, appears to have formidable substance in view of the series of decisions of the Supreme Court. The decisions of the Supreme Court are five in number and they are Bhaurao, , Kanwal Ram, , both decided in 1965. Priya Bala AIR 1971 SC 1153 : (1971 Cri LJ 939) decided in 1971 and Lingari Obulamma, and Gopal Lal, , both decided in 1979.Subir Kumar Kundu Alias Sambhu vs State Of West Bengal on 19 December, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102806/ 29. In Bhaurao (supra), it was observed by the Supreme Court that the expression ""whoever ....marries"" in Section 494 must mean ""whoever marries validly"" or ""whoever marries and whose marriage is a valid one"", because ""if the marriage is not a valid one according to the law applicable to the parties, no question of its being void by reason of its taking place during the life of the husband or wife of the person marrying arises"". These observations have been quoted with approval in Priya Bala (supra) and it has been ruled that ""it is clear that if the alleged second marriage is not a valid one according to law applicable to the parties"", it would not attract Section 494 of the Penal Code. In Lingari Obulamma (supra) also, it has been observed that ""it is well-settled that before a conviction can be recorded under Section 494"", it ""must be proved...that both the marriages were valid and strictly according to law governing the parties"". 10. The expression ""both the marriages were valid"" would apparently appear to be blatantly contradictory as Section 494 can be attracted only when the second marriage is void under the law for being bigamous. Therefore, all that this apparently contradictory expression should mean (Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edition, Volume 10, page 664) is that it must be proved that the accused, being already married and having the intention of appearing to contract a second marriage, has gone ""through a form known to and recognised by the law as capable of producing a valid marriage"". The expression ""whoever marries validly"" in the observations of the Supreme Court should, therefore, be construed to mean ""whoever goes through a form of marriage known to and recognised by the law as capable of producing a valid marriage"" and the expression ""marriage"" in Section 494 would accordingly mean marriage valid in form though not in law and the expression ""marries"" in that section would thus mean going through such form of marriage. This aspect appears to have been clarified in Gopal Lal (supra at 714, 715) decided by the same Bench few days after Lingari Obulamma (supra), and it has been observed that ""the second marriage is required to be a valid one in the sense that the necessary ceremonies required by law or custom have been actually performed"". A solemnisation of marriage, that is, a marriage ""celebrated or performed with proper ceremonies and due form"", a marriage valid in form only, is all that is necessary, and not a marriage valid in law, which a bigamous marriage cannot obviously be. 11. In view of the ratio of the aforesaid decisions of the Supreme Court, we would have to accept the contention of Mr. Roy that a case for bigamy (unless any of the marriages is under the Special Marriage Act) would entirely depend on the positive proof of observance and performance of forms and ceremonies required to constitute a valid marriage. It is generally said that the all-pervading fear-psychosis of the primitive men resulted in the belief that the union between the sexes was also impregnated with danger and in their endeavour to avert such danger, all the resources of magic had to be utilised leading to the development of this elaborate code of nuptial rites and ceremonies (Crawley -- The Mystic Rose, page 222) and it seems that even at this distant time of the impending 21st century, we are still required to attach great weight to the occult or mysterious forces of these rituals and ceremonies. 12. In all the four Supreme Court decisions, namely, in Bhaurao (supra), Kanwal Ram (supra), Priya Bala (supra) and Lingari Obulamma (supra), the prosecution failed as it was not proved that the essential ceremonies necessary for the solemnisation of a marriage were performed, even though there was sufficient evidence to show that a ceremony of marriage was performed.Subir Kumar Kundu Alias Sambhu vs State Of West Bengal on 19 December, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102806/ 3","[ '4','11']"

Narayana, J. 1. Defendants 1 and 2 in O.S.No. 58/82 on the file of District Judge, Adilabad, aggrieved by the Judgment and decree of the trial Court had preferred the above Appeal and defendants 5 to 9 had preferred the Cross Objections wherein they had questioned the marriage of Rajeshwar Reddy with the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. 2. For the purpose of convenience the parties will be referred to as plaintiffs and defendants only as shown in O.S.No. 59/82. 3. The said suit was filed by the plaintiff for partition and separate possession of 22/45th share in the plaint schedule properties. The trial Court after the respective pleadings of the parties and settlement of Issues had examined P.W.1 to P.W.5, D.W.1 to D.W.12 and had marked Exs.A-1 to A-16 and also Exs.B-1 to B-173 and ultimately had passed a preliminary decree and aggrieved by the same, the present appeal and the Cross-Objections had been preferred. 4. The plaintiffs had pleaded in the plaint as follows: The suit properties consisting of Ac.2-26 guntas situated in Adilabad Revenue village and a house situated in Adilabad town and cash which is in deposit in Andhra Bank branch, Adilabad are the self acquisitions of late Rajeshwar Reddy. The said Rajeshwar Reddy died leaving behind three widows namely Rukma Bai (1st plaintiff), Shankaramma (2nd defendant) and Mallamma (8th defendant). The plaintiffs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8 are the daughters and 6th defendant is the son of Rajeshwar Reddy through the 1st plaintiff. 1st defendant is the son and defendants 3 and 4 are the daughters of Rajeshwar Reddy through the 2nd defendant. Defendants 5, 6 and 7 are the sons and the 9th defendant is the daughter of Rajeshwar Reddy through the 8th defendant. Rajeshwar Reddy died intestate on 16-8-1981 leaving behind the plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 9 as his legal heirs. The plaintiffs 2 to 8 are entitled for 1/15th share each and the 1st plaintiff is entitled to 1/45th share in the suit properties. The defendants, 1, 3 to 7 and 9 are entitled for 1/15th share each and defendants 2 and 8 are entitled to 1/45th share each in the suit properties. Thus the plaintiffs 1 to 8 are entitled to 22/45th share in the suit properties. In spite of repeated demands the defendants failed to effect partition of the suit properties and to deliver the plaintiff's share. The plaintiff also got issued a notice through their Advocate on 16-12-1981 demanding partition and separate possession of their share. Inspite of service of the said notice the defendants have neither replied nor partitioned the suit properties. There were quarrels amongst the woman folk. Hence for the sake of convenience, the 1st plaintiff started residing in a separate house. The 1st defendant also started living in a separate house to avoid quarrels between the women folk and all the properties remained undivided. The marriage of the plaintiff with Rajeshwar Reddy was celebrated in the year 1952. After the death of Rajeshwar Reddy the defendants are not giving any share in the crops and theDr. M. Satyanarayana Reddy And ... vs Rukma Bai And Ors. on 4 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/355032/ 1rents from the suit properties to the plaintiffs. Hence the suit for partition and separate possession of the plaintiff's share in the suit properties. 5. Defendants 3 and 4 were set ex parte. The 1st and the 2nd defendants who had preferred the present Appeal had filed a written statement with the following allegations: It is true that the 2nd defendant is the legally wedded wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy and the 1st defendant is the son and defendants 3 and 4 are the daughters of 2nd defendant through Rajeshwar Reddy. The 1st plaintiff is not the wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy, but she was only his kept mistress. The plaintiffs 2 to 8 are the children of the 1st plaintiff born through late Rajeshwar Reddy and as their mother i.e., 1st plaintiff was only a kept mistress they are not the legal heirs of Rajeshwar Reddy and therefore they are not entitled to succeed to his properties i.e., land, house and also cash which is in deposit of Andhra Bank, Branch Adilabad. Likewise, 8th defendant also was not the wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy, but she was his kept mistress. Defendants, 5,6,7 and 9 are the children born to her through late Rajeshwar Reddy. The defendants 5,6,7 and 9 are the legitimate children of late Rajeshwar Reddy and their mother i.e., the 8th defendant, who was only a kept mistress and as such they are not the legal heirs of late Rajeshwar Reddy and they cannot succeed to his properties i.e., land, the house and the cash which is in deposit in the Andhra Bank, Branch Adilabad. It is true that the Rajeshwar Reddy died intestate on 16-9-1981 at Adilabad leaving behind the defendants 1 to 4 as his legal heirs. The defendants 1 and 2 alone are in joint possession of the suit properties of late Rajeshwar Reddy. Late Rajeshwar Reddy had left Rs. 22,500/- in deposit in S.B. Account in Andhra Bank Branch, Adilabad. In one portion of the suit house the 2nd defendant is residing and in the rest of ten portions there are tenants. The 2nd defendant is collecting the rents from the said tenants. The defendants 1 and 2 are paying the tax for the suit house and land revenue for the suit lands. The plaintiffs and defendants 5 to 9 are not entitled for any share in the suit properties. After receipt of the notice from the plaintiffs the 1st defendant approached the elders and they called the 1st plaintiff and explained to her with regard to her status as kept mistress and status of her children as illegitimate children and the 1st plaintiff agreed not to proceed in any court of law against the 1st defendant and so the 1st defendant did not choose to give any reply to the plaintiff's notice. The 1st defendant is having medical practice at Adilabad since 1972. In 1980 the 1st defendant constructed his own house at Adilabad and shifted to that place. Prior to the construction of his house the 1st defendant used to live with his wife and children in the suit house with his father and mother. There were no quarrels between the women folk as alleged by the plaintiffs. The 1st plaintiff and the 8th defendant used to work as labourers under late Rajeshwar Reddy in his contract works. In that connection Rajeshwar Reddy came in contact with them and he kept them as his mistresses, but he did not marry them. Late Rajeshwar Reddy gave houses to the 1st plaintiff and the 8th defendant and he also educated their children and performed the marriages of their children. All the religious functions and marriages were performed by Rajeshwar Reddy and the 2nd defendant only. The 8th defendant and the 1st plaintiff never participated in any religious functions with late Rajeshwar Reddy. Late Rajeshwar Reddy had also kept mistresses by name Achamma and Laxmi @ Madhavi. The plaintiffs and defendants 5 to 9 were never in joint possession of the suit properties with the defendants 1 to 4. Hence the plaintiffs are not entitled or any share in the suit properties.Dr. M. Satyanarayana Reddy And ... vs Rukma Bai And Ors. on 4 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/355032/ 26. Likewise, on behalf of defendants 5 to 9, a written statement was filed with the following allegations: The 8th defendant alone is the legally wedded wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy and their marriage took place on 6-4-1946. The defendants 5 to 7 and 9 are the sons and daughters of late Rajeshwar Reddy through the 8th defendant. The 2nd defendant joined the company of late Rajeshwar Reddy in the year 1948 and at that time the 2nd defendant was having 1st defendant with her and the 1st defendant was aged about one or 11/2 years old at that time. Thus the 2nd defendant was not the legally wedded wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy. The 1st plaintiff also is not the legally wedded wife of late Rajeshwar Reddy and that she was his kept mistress. The 1st plaintiff has got her married husband and he is living with the 1st plaintiff even to-day and the plaintiffs 2 to 8 are not the children of late Rajeshwar Reddy. Hence they are not entitled to claim any share in the suit property and they never lived jointly with Rajeshwar Reddy. It is true that notices were issued to the defendants 5 to 9 by the plaintiffs, but they did not choose to give any reply as the claim of the plaintiffs was false. The plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 4 are not entitled for any share in the suit properties. Plaintiffs have not shown all the properties which were left behind by Rajeshwar Reddy and as such the suit is bad for not showing all the properties. Further one Achamma who is also one of the married (wives) of Rajeshwar Reddy is not made as a party to the suit. 7. Subsequent thereto the said Achamma was impleaded as a party, but however, she remained ex parte. 8. On the strength of the pleadings of the respective parties the trial Court has settled the following Issues: (1) Whether the plaintiff No. 1 is the legally wedded wife of late Sri Rajeshwar Reddy and entitled to inherit to his properties? (2) Whether plaintiff No. 2 to 8 are legitimate children of late Sri Rajeshwar Reddy and are entitled to inherit to his properties? (3) Whether the defendant No. 2 is the legally wedded wife of late Sri Rajeshwar Reddy and entitled to inherit to his properties? (4) Whether the defendants 1, 3 and 4 are the legitimate children of late Sri Rajeshwar Reddy and entitled to inherit to the properties? (5) Whether defendant No. 8 is the legally wedded wife of late Sri Rajeshwar Reddy and entitled to inherit to his properties?

By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the appellants seek to challenge the impugned order dated 11.11.2010, passed by the Family Court, whereby the application filed by the appellants under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act to seek waiver of one year period for presenting the joint divorce petition under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act was dismissed. 2. The grounds taken by both the appellants in the said application are that the appellant no.1 is working with the Bikanervala Food Pvt. Ltd as an Assistant Unit Manager in Delhi, while appellant no.2 is working with Qatar Airways, Doha, United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a Flight Attendant and both the parties could not live together for a day after solemnization of their marriage on 12.4.2010. It was also stated by them that their marriage was not consummated and both the parties realizedMohin Saili And Sonali Singh vs Nil on 26 November, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198390874/ 1that they are totally incompatible, having different mind sets, ambitions and career orientations. It was also stated that the appellant no.2 since is working with an Airlines in Doha, therefore, it is not possible for her to join her husband appellant no.1. 3. The learned Family Court after placing reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Anil Kumar Jain Vs. Maya Jain (2009) 10 SCC 415, dismissed the said application moved by the appellants. The learned Family Court held that requirement of Section 13 B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act is that before presentation of the divorce petition, the parties are required to live separately for a period of one year or more. The court further held that considering the fact that the marriage between the parties was solemnized on 12.4.2010, the statutory period of one year did not come to an end on the day of the presentation of the said petition, therefore, the parties were held not entitled for the grant of exemption of statutory requirement as envisaged under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Feeling aggrieved with the said order, both the parties have preferred the present appeal. 4. Ms. Pasrija, learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance on the judgment of this court in Pooja Gupta & Anr. Vs. Nil, 118 (2005) DLT 492, and unreported judgment in Sh. Tarun Kumar Vaish Vs. Ms. Meenakshi Vaish, decided by this court on 13.4.2005. Both the judgments are given by the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mukul Mudgal, as he then was. 5. Taking into consideration the Statement of Objects and Reasons behind the 1996 amendment in the proviso to Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hon'ble Judge in Pooja Gupta's case (Supra) felt that the legislative intent behind the said amendment was expeditious disposal of divorce cases by way of mutual consent. Relevant para of the said judgment is reproduced as under: ""8. The above statement of objects and reasons though made in the context of parity with Section 28 of Special Marriage Act also clearly indicates that the legislative intent was expeditious disposal of divorces by mutual consent. In my view as long as the Court is satisfied as an essential reason for exemption for filing a divorce by mutual consent prior to expiry of one year after the marriage that the plea for mutual consent is not under coercion/intimidation or undue influence and there are no chances of reconciliation and the parties have fully understood the impact and effect of the divorce by mutual consent, the continuance of such a marriage is bound to cause undue hardship to the spouses. The other relevant considerations which may be considered for granting the exemption from passage of one year before filing a petition for divorce by mutual consent are: (a) the maturity and the comprehension of the spouses; (b) absence of coercion/intimidation/undue influence; (c) the duration of the marriage sought to be dissolved; (d) absence of any possibility of reconciliation;Mohin Saili And Sonali Singh vs Nil on 26 November, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198390874/ 2(e) lack of frivolity; (f) lack of misrepresentation or concealment; (g) the age of the spouses and the deleterious effect of the continuance of a sterile marriage on the prospects of re- marriage of the parties."" 6. Similar controversy again cropped up before Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh when dealing with the Matrimonial Appeal bearing MAT APP NO. 134/2009 in the matter of Sh. Nand Kishore Vs. Smt. Suman, decided on 15.12.2009 and then in the case of Ms.Urvashi Sibal & Anr. Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, decided on 7.1.2010. Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh referred to Pooja Gupta's case (Supra), and after placing reliance on the two judgments of the Apex Court in Smt. Sureshta Devi Vs. Om Prakash (1991) 2 SCC 25 and Anil Kumar Jain Vs. Maya Jain (2009) 10 SCC 415, took a view that under no circumstance, Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act can be invoked in the proceedings initiated under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh also found that the Apex Court decision in the case of Smt. Sureshta Devi (Supra) was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge during the course of hearing in Pooja Gupta's case (Supra) and therefore, the said judgment ignoring the decision of the Apex Court would have no binding effect. It would be relevant to reproduce the observations of the learned judge in the case of Urvashi Sibal (supra) here: ""6. In Nand Kishore v. Suman Matrimonial Appeal No. 134/2009 decided by me on 15th December, 2009, while dealing with a similar question, reliance was placed on 'Smt. Sureshta Devi's case (supra)'. I further distinguished the provisions contained in Section 13B(1) and Section 14 of the Act for waiving the statutory period of one year before filing a petition under Section 13 or 13B of the Act, as the case may be. It was observed: 12. It is noted that requirement under Section 13B(1) of the Act is separation for a period of one year or more beside others to file a petition. Whereas under Section 14 of the Act, Court has the power to condone the statutory period of one year, required for filing a petition under Section 13 of the Act or any other provision contained in the said Act, from the date of the marriage. Therefore, under no circumstances, Section 14 of the Act can be invoked in the proceedings initiated under Section 13B of the Act. 7. Thus, it is clear that the statutory period of one year required to be maintained by the parties for filing a petition under Section 13B of the Act are independent of the provisions contained in Section 14 of the Act. Section 13B when read is a complete Code in itself and, therefore, for filing a petition under Section 13B of the Act, the parties cannot be allowed to invoke Section 14 seeking waiver of the statutory period of one year from separation for filing a petition under Section 13B of the Act.""Mohin Saili And Sonali Singh vs Nil on 26 November, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198390874/ 3","['28', '13', '14']"

JUSTICE KAILASH GAMBHIR KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. 1. By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the challenge is by the husband to the impugned order dated 22.7.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge thereby recalling the judgment and decree dated 22.4.2008 on the application moved by the respondent wife under Section 151 CPC. 2. Brief facts of the case as borne out from the respective pleadings of the parties are that the appellant husband and the respondent wife were married on 27th January, 2002 at Gurgaon according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and a child was born out of the wedlock of the parties on 24.1.2003. Thereafter, a petition for divorce by mutual consent was filed by both the parties under Section 13(B)(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and as per the averments made in the said petition the stand taken was that the parties had been living together as husband and wife after solemnization of their marriage at house bearing No. J-4/90B, DDA Flats Kalkaji, New Delhi; that both the parties last resided together as husband and wife at house No. 47, Second Floor, Rampuri, Kalkaji, New Delhi up to first week of April, 2007 and thereafter due to some temperamental differences the husband left the company of his wife and then started residing separately. It was also averred that efforts were made by the parents of the respective parties to persuade the parties for reconciliation, but the same failed and the marriage between the parties irretrievably broken down and hence, both the parties had mutually agreed to dissolve their marriage. It was averred that both the parties had amicably settled all their claims and disputes with regard to dowry, stridhan, maintenance-present, past & future and permanent alimony etc.in respect of wife, petitioner No.1 asSarabjit Singh vs Ms. Gurpal Kaur on 27 July, 2012 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139981657/ 1also in respect of the minor child of the petitioners in her custody, for a total sum of Rs. 2 lakhs payable on the part of husband, petitioner No.2 to petitioner No. 1 as full and final settlement of all their claims. It was also averred that the custody of the child will remain with the mother upto the age of 8 years and thereafter her husband will be at liberty to take the child in his custody for better upbringing of the child. It was also averred that mutual consent of the parties was not obtained by force, fraud or undue influence and the said petition was not preferred by them in collusion with each other. The said petition was filed by both the parties through a common Advocate, namely, Ms. Ranjana Kaur and the petition was signed by both the parties besides being supported by their respective affidavits. Respective affidavits of the parties were duly identified by their common Advocate and the same were duly attested by the oath Commissioner. Along with the said petition, the parties placed on record their marriage card, photograph of the marriage, photocopy of the driving license of the wife, photocopy of the bank passbook of the husband, photocopy of the election card of the husband and the petition also carried separate photographs of both the husband and the wife. Along with the said petition, Power of Attorney was filed by the said common Advocate, Ms. Ranjna Kaur. The said Power of Attorney is shown to be carrying the signatures of both the parties. The said joint petition was taken up by the matrimonial Court on 9.4.2008 and the ordersheet of 9.4.2008 shows the presence of both the parties along with their counsel, Ms. Ranjana Kaur. The joint statement of both the parties was recorded by the Court on the same day and the matter was then adjourned for order on 17.4.2008 on which date the Court directed the presence of the wife, petitioner No. 1, to certify the encashment of the cheque, which was given to her by her husband, petitioner No. 2 at the time of recording of their joint statement. The matter was accordingly taken up by the Court on 17.4.2008 and after hearing the arguments of counsel for the parties, the Court allowed the said petition filed by both the parties under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Both the parties were shown to be present on the said date along with their common counsel Ms. Ranjna Kaur. The learned Court recorded the submission of petitioner No. 1, informing the Court that the cheque which was given to her by her husband, petitioner No. 2 was duly encashed. 3. Simultaneously, both the parties had also filed a joint petition under Section 13(B)(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 along with an application under Section 151 CPC to seek waiver of the statutory period of six months for entertaining the second motion. The second motion petition also carried the photographs of both the parties. The second motion petition was also supported by the respective affidavits of both the parties. Both the affidavits were duly attested by the Oath Commissioner after both the deponents were duly identified by their Advocate, Ms. Ranjana Kaur. The joint statement of both the parties was recorded by the Court on the second motion as well and after waiving the statutory period of six months, the Court adjourned the matter for 22nd April, 2008 for arguments/orders. The arguments were heard by the learned Court on 22 nd April, 2008 and on the same day the Court allowed the said joint petition filed by the parties under Section 13(B)(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 thereby dissolving their marriage by mutual consent. 4. The said judgment and decree dated 22nd April, 2008 was challenged by the respondent wife by preferring CM(M) No. 328/2009 on the ground that the said judgment/decree was procured by her husband by fraud as well as by impersonation of respondent wife. The respondent wife in the said appeal took a stand that she had neither appeared before the Trial Court nor had filed any suchSarabjit Singh vs Ms. Gurpal Kaur on 27 July, 2012 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139981657/ 2divorce petition by mutual consent and did not even engage any Advocate for such purpose. The said CM(M) was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 17th April, 2009 thereby directing the respondent wife to move an appropriate application before the Trial Court to seek recall of the orders dated 9th ,17th and 22nd April, 2008. This Court further directed the Trial Court to dispose of such an application of the wife within a period of four weeks from the date of presentation of the application. Pursuant to the said direction given by this Court, the respondent wife had moved an application under Section 151 of CPC, 1908 to seek setting aside of the order/judgment/ decree of divorce dated 9th April, 2008, 17th April, 2008 and 22nd April, 2008. The respondent wife in her application reiterated her stand, as was taken by her in the appeal that the said judgment and decree was obtained by her husband by playing fraud upon her and also on the court. The respondent wife further took a stand that the appellant husband had forged her signatures on the said petitions, affidavits, etc. and took the help of some lady to impersonate her. The respondent wife further took a stand that she had never engaged any Advocate for filing the said petitions and that she had neither signed any paper nor tendered any statement on oath or ever appeared before the Court for seeking divorce by mutual consent. The respondent wife further disclosed that it was only in the last week of November, 2008 that she had learnt about the passing of the said judgment and decree dated 22 nd April, 2008. The respondent further stated that at the time of marriage they were residing at J4/90B, DDA Flats Kalkaji, New Delhi and on 2.3.2008 they had shifted to House No. G9A, Kalkaji, New Delhi. It was also stated by the respondent wife that in the year 2006, the appellant husband had purchased the house bearing No. 47, Second Floor, Rampuri, Kalkaji, New Delhi after selling gold and diamond jewellery of the respondent and also taking a huge amount from the respondent including a sum of Rs. 50,000/- which was given to the appellant by the father of the respondent. It is also the case of the respondent that on 21.11.2007 she had lodged a complaint with the police control room by dialing help line No. 100 and upon such complaint of the respondent DD entry 3A was registered along with later DD entry Nos. 7A, 21 and 60. Pursuant to the said complaint, the appellant husband and his mother were questioned by the Inspector, Women Cell and the medical examination of the respondent wife as well as her mother-in-law was also done. It is also the case of the respondent wife that in December, 2007 her husband clandestinely sold the Kalkaji flat for a sum of Rs. 45 lakhs and pocketed the said entire amount without giving a single penny to her. It is also the case of the respondent wife that on 2.3.2008 they had shifted to the rented accommodation i.e. house bearing No. G-9A, Third floor, Kalkaji, New Delhi.

It is also the case of the respondent wife that on 6.10.2008 the appellant husband came to the matrimonial home from Mumbai to spend the holidays and on 10.10.2008, when the respondent did not find him available in the matrimonial home and when he was also not returning her phone calls, the matter was reported by the respondent wife to the police control room and upon such complaint of the respondent DD entry No.15A and 65B dated 10.10.2008 were registered.

C.J. 1. This appeal is preferred by the appellant-husband against the order passed by the District Judge, Mandi granting an ex parte decree of judicial separation in favour of the first respondent Smt. Khimi who claims to be the wife of the appellant. 2. Facts of the case show that the first respondent Smt. Khimi filed a petition for judicial separation under the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that her appellant husband has a second wife, who is in this case the respondent No. 2, and is treating her cruelly. It is found that during the pendency of the proceedings the first respondent made an application for interim alimony and costs under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. On that application the court passed an order on 8th August, 1972 for payment of monthly allowance and cost of the petition amounting to. Rs. 200. Proceedings taken before the trial court show that the appellant-husband thereafter failed in paying the amount of coot as ordered by the Court. Ultimately, on 27th Feb., 1973 the appellant husband made the following statement before the court: ""I have not been able to bring the money today, which I have promised to pay on the last date of hearing. Now I promise that I shall pay Rs. 200 on 2-3-1973 to the petitioner and on my so paying the amount, the petitioner should summon her evidence for 17-3-1973 and the rest of the amount may be recovered from me by the petitioner by taking out execution proceedings."" On this statement the first respondent Smt. Khimi made the following statement: ""I have heard the statement of the respondent and accept his statement and undertake to produce all my evidence on 17-3-1973 in case the respondent pays me Rs. 200 on 2-3-1973, as undertaken by him."" The parties having made the above quoted statements, the court passed the following order on the same date: ""In view of the above statements of the parties, the case is now fixed for 17-3-1973 for the evidence of the petitioner. The petitioner is directed to file a list of witnesses, process fee and diet money for summoning her witnesses, in case the respondent pays her Rs. 200 on 2-3-1973, as expenses of proceedings."" 3. The matter was thereafter taken up on 17-3-1973 when the appellant-husband appeared before the court and made the following statement:Jai Singh vs Smt. Khimi Bhiklu And Anr. on 23 February, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1000773/ 1""I had undertaken to pay Rs. 200 to the petitioner on or before 2-3-1973, which I have not paid so far, nor I am prepared to pay the same."" The appellant husband thus having refused to carry out the promise of the payment of the cost of Rs. 200, the court passed the order on the same date i.e. 17-3-1973, striking out his defence, and ordering the case to proceed ex parte against the appellant-husband. Thereafter, the court recorded evidence ex parte and then passed the decree for judicial separation as requested by the respondent No. 1. 4. In this appeal the grievance which is made by the appellant-husband is that the learned Judge had no jurisdiction to proceed ex parte against him, and therefore, the eventual decree which is passed against him is liable to be set aside. Since this court found that the question involved is of some importance, the matter was referred to a Division Bench. This is how this matter has come before us. 5. The simple question which arises to be determined is whether in the set of circumstances which are found in this case it was open to the court to pass an order striking out the defence of the appellant and whether this order is conducive to the interest of justice. 6. Shri Indar Singh who appeared on behalf of the appellant contended that though under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court has powers to pass an interim order to pay alimony and expenses of the proceedings, there is nothing in the Act which would enable the court to pass an order - striking out the defence, in case the spouse ordered to pay the expenses and maintenance pendente lite has defaulted in doing so. In this connection he has also drawn our attention to Section 28 of the Act which says that all decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. According to Shri Indar Singh, therefore, the remedy for the first respondent was to execute the order of the court awarding expenses pendente lite. He also drew our attention to the fact that the court could have enforced the order as regards payment of costs pendente lite even by starting contempt proceedings against the appellant. Therefore, in the submission of Shri Indar Singh, the court, instead of striking out the defence in a matrimonial proceeding should resort to any of the above alternative methods for the purposes of enforcing the order as regards payment of costs. 7. During the course of the arguments Shri Indar Singh relied on several decisions of various High Courts showing that in a fit case even matrimonial proceedings can be stayed if the spouse ordered to pay the cost or interim alimony has defaulted in doing so. Relying upon these decisions it was contended that in this particular case the court could have stayed the proceedings with a view to enable the respondent No. 1 to realise the amount of costs by executing the order passed earlier under Section 24 of the Act. 8. Before dealing with the different decisions which are cited at the Bar, we shall first consider what would be the appropriate method by which the court can enforce this order of interim alimony andJai Singh vs Smt. Khimi Bhiklu And Anr. on 23 February, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1000773/ 2expenses pendente lite in a case where the party ordered to pay these amounts deliberately fails to do so. We have referred at length, in the foregoing portion of this judgment, to the proceedings that have taken place before the learned trial Judge. These proceedings clearly show that the appellant-husband had, pursuant to the order passed by the court under Section 24 of the Act, twice promised to pay up the amount of the expenses pendente lite. It was on his promise that the matter was ultimately adjourned to 17-3-1973 when he came out with a statement that he was not at all prepared to pay up the amount in question. It was on his promise that the first respondent had called her evidence on 17-3-1973. These proceedings therefore make it abundantly clear that the appellant husband has deliberately and contumaciously flouted the court's order to pay up the amount of cost which would have enabled the first respondent to put up her case before the court. 9. It need not be emphasised that the purpose of Section 24 of the Act is to enable a financially weak party to litigate his or her rights in a matrimonial cause. Section 24 thus embodies in itself a very wholesome principle which is conducive to rule of law. It contemplates that none of the parties to a matrimonial cause should be able to take undue advantage of his financial superiority to defeat the rightful claims of the weaker party. It should also be noted that the proceedings contemplated by Section 24 are the proceedings pendente lite. Obviously, therefore, these proceedings have the limited purpose of enabling the weaker party to substantiate his or her rights during the pendency of the proceedings. It is under these circumstances that the question which arises for our consideration should be appreciated so that the main purpose of the Legislature in enacting Section 24 of the Act would not be defeated. 10. It is true that Section 28 of the Act contemplates the enforcement of orders by execution. The question is whether this remedy for the purpose of enforcing the order of interim alimony and expenses passed by the court is a remedy which is so effective as to carry out the purpose of Section 24 as well as of the statute, namely, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It need not be emphasised that enforcement of an order passed by the court under Section 28 by way of execution would necessarily entail a long and arduous process, and if it is held that the interim order passed by the court under Section 24 of the Act can be enforced only in that particular manner, that is, by execution, the matrimonial proceedings would be required to be stayed till the order is enforced in execution In other words, in order to obtain the en-forcement of the order passed under | Section 24 of the Act through the process of execution, the parties would be required to wait, in certain cases, till a number of years. The question is whether this particular procedure would enhance the object of the Act. Matrimonial proceedings by their very nature are expected to be expeditious because there would be absolutely no point in giving redress to a party in matrimonial proceedings after a number of years which would not stop the parties ageing. We need not dwell more on this point because the Act itself recognises under Section 21-B the necessity of expeditious trial of the petitions filed under the Act. Section 21-B provides that the trial should be conducted from day-to-day until its conclusion, and it directs the courts to make every endeavour to conclude the trial within six months from the date of the service of notice of the petition on the respondent. Even appeals preferred under the Act are expected to be concluded within three months from the date of service of notice of appeal on the respondent. This section therefore clearly reveals the mind of the Legislature that stay of the proceedings would not be furthering the ends of justice.Jai Singh vs Smt.

The present C.R.P. is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the orders of II Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad in I.A. No. 723/91 in I.A. No. 199/90 in O.P. No. 254/89 dated : 6-7-1992. 2. The facts which give rise to the present Petition are that the Petitioner (husband) filed O.P. No. 254/89 for dissolution of marriage. The respondent No. 1 (wife) filed application in I.A. No. 199/90 under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act for legal expenses and interim maintenance. The matrimonial Court on 21-9-90 passed orders granting Rs. 500/- towards legal expenses and Rs. 500/- towards maintenance to wife and child. 3. While so, the respondent No. 1 wife filed M.C. No. 12/90 under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. claiming maintenance for herself and her son before the VI Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad. The said application was allowed for Rs. 550/- on 6-2-1991. Aggrieved by the said order the petitioner filed Criminal Revision Petition No. 171/92 before the IV Addl. Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad and the same is pending. 4. The petitioner consequent on the orders of Criminal Court in M.C. No. 12/90 dated 6-2-1991 filed application before the matrimonial Court to modify the orders dated 21-9-1990 passed in I.A. No. 199/90. The said application was dismissed holding that the application under Section 151 C.P.C. is not maintainable and it is open for the petitioner to seek orders from the appropriate Court. The said order is assailed in this Revision Petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. 5. The advocate for the respondents was not present. Keeping in view the general importance of the matter, this Court requested Sri S. Satyanarayana Prasad, Advocate to assist this Court as amicus curaie. He was gracious enough to accept the request and made detailed submissions. 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Respondents were granted interim maintenance by the matrimonial Court on 21-9-90. They were also granted maintenance by the Criminal Court by orders dated 6-2-1991 in M.C. No. 12/90. Thus, from the date of Criminal Court order the petitioner is being made to pay maintenance twice - one under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act and another under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. He thus submits that he is liable to pay only one set of maintenance and not both. Hence the matrimonial Court erred in not modifying the interim maintenance order. 7. On the other hand, Sri Prasad, submits that the order of matrimonial Court and Criminal Court are quite different and they are passed to achieve different purposes. He further submits that there is no bar for claiming and receiving the maintenance apart from the interim maintenance granted byT. Rajender Singh vs Maya Devi Alias Gayatri And Ors. on 28 November, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883980/ 1the matrimonial Court pendente lite. The orders do not overlap each other and that they are required to be executed in accordance with respective provisions of law. 8. The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on Mamata Rani v. Raj Kumar 1985 (1) HLR 496 to support his contention that the wife is not entitled for the maintenance twice. I have perused the said decision and I find that there is no discussion on the subject. Mr. Prasad relies on Danda Chanchaiah v. Danda Mangamma 1968 (2) Andh WR 98 : (1969 Cri LJ 684). In the said case the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate Darsi, under Section 488 Cr.P.C. awarding maintenance of Rs. 40/- was challenged on the ground that the husband filed application for restitution of conjugal rights and the date is pending in the Civil Court under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act. Rejecting the contention raised on behalf of petitioner, the Court observed thus, ""The object of Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code is the prevention of vagrancy and to provide neglected wives and children a cheap and speedy remedy. This remedy is irrespective of other remedies such neglected wives and children may have under their personal law or under any statute. The existence of other more efficacious remedy is no bar to the maintainability of a petition under Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code. Indeed it is irrelevant. Similarly the pendency of other proceedings where the status of the parties is in question or where a husband seeks some matrimonial relief is no bar to the maintainability of a petition under Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code. Nor can the proceedings under Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code be made to await the result of such other proceedings. Otherwise the object of Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code providing for a cheap and speedy remedy will be frustrated. However, where a competent Civil Court declares the rights of the parties, the Magistrate passing an order under Section 488, Criminal Procedure Code is empowered to cancel or suitably vary the order. This is provided under Section 489(2), Criminal Procedure Code and this provision amply protects the rights of the parties as may ultimately by determined by the Civil Courts."" In Swarnajyawati v. L. B. Munnalal 1971 (2) Andh WR 351 : 91971 Cri LJ 291) Madhava Reddy J., (as he then was) held that the maintenance ordered under Section 24 is only and interim maintenance. Hence as order under Section 488(1) Cr.P.C. cannot be cancelled merely because interim maintenance has been awarded. It is only under Section 489(2) Cr.P.C. when it appears to the Magistrate that in consequence of any decision of a competent Civil Court, an order made under Section 488 should be cancelled or varied, may cancel the order or as the case may be, vary the same accordingly. Hence order of interim maintenance under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act cannot warrant cancellation of order under Section 488 Cr.P.C. Therefore the order must necessarily await the final disposal before the matrimonial Court. It is to be noted that Section 488 of old Code, is now Section 125 in the new Code, except to the extent covering the parents and quantum of maintenance in the new Code. 9. Mr. Prasad takes me to the case in Capt. Ramesh Chandra Kaustal v. Mrs. Veena Kaustal . The Supreme Court observed in the said case as follows : ""Broadly stated and as an abstract proposition, it is valid to assent, that a final determination of a Civil right by a Civil Court must prevail against a like decision by a criminal Court. But this principleT. Rajender Singh vs Maya Devi Alias Gayatri And Ors. on 28 November, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883980/ 2has no application to a case where pending proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. a Civil Court passed an interim order of maintenance of the wife proceedings for divorce by the husband. The reasons are (1) the directions by the Civil Court is not a final determination under the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act, but an order pendente lite under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act (2) the amount does not include the claim for maintenance of the children although the orders does advert to the fact that the wife had their custody"". Thus it is held by the Supreme Court that an order under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act is not final determination of the Case. In G. Ramanathan v. Mrs. Revathy 1989 Cri LJ 2037 the learned single Judge of Madras High Court held that when a competent Civil Court is seized of the matter with regard to obtaining relief of maintenance, the wife approaching the Criminal Court is against the scheme of law. Para 4 of the order reads thus : ""When a competent Civil Court has already (sic) of the matter and when it is possible without incurring any expenditure or any other inconvenience to approach, by way of a simple petition, the Civil Court so as to obtain maintenance, it is not proper on the part of the wife to go before the Magistrate for an order. The proper course is to approach the Civil Court which is already seized. Further under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. if an order regarding maintenance is passed by the competent Civil Court, the Magistrate should have to set aside its own order which is more in the nature of a temporary measure made after a summary hearing to meet an emergent situation. Therefore the fact of seizing the Magistrate when the competent Civil Court has been already seized would cause only judicial waste of time since the order obtained is ultimately liable to be cancelled. I therefore come to the conclusion that the institution of a proceeding under Section 125, Cr.P.C. when a Civil proceeding is already pending between the parties under the Hindu Marriage Act is against the scheme of law contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Chapt. IX of the Cr.P.C."" I am afraid, I am not able to subscribe to the view of the learned Judge. The scope and purpose of two proceedings are different and distin ct. The proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act are quite independent in as much as the interim maintenance granted under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is only for a temporary period during the pendency of the proceedings before the matrimonial Court, whereas the amount awarded by the Judicial Magistrate under Section 125 is not for a limited period, but is for a period during which the wife and other dependants of the husband are neglected. It is only after final verdict of the Civil Court, declaring of their respective rights, the husband may approach the Criminal Court to cancel or vary the order of maintenance. Kerala High Court in Kuttappan v. Thanka (sic) observed, thus : ""Jurisdiction of the Act can be invoked only in a matrimonial dispute of the nature contemplated under the provisions of the Act is before the matrimonial Court. Relief of permanent alimony or maintenance pendente lite can be claimed by either spouse. In the case of permanent alimony, what is to be considered mainly is income or other property of the parties along with the conduct ofT.

C.J. 1. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the II Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, allowing a petition, O. P. No. 63 of 1979, filed under Sec. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for granting a decree for divorce and directing the custody of the minor child to be with the mother, the respondent herein. 2. The husband, who was the petitioner in the lower Court, is the appellant in this appeal. It would appear from the order under appeal that the husband had alleged that the male child was born to the respondent on 14-1-1978 ""out of the wedlock"", evidently what he means is as a result of the wedlock or matrimonial relationship and not an illegitimate child. It was his case that after the birth of the child, the relationship between the husband and the wife became strained and the wife began indulging in immoral activities and started living in adultery. The respondent used to come home during nights in a drunken condition and sometimes absent herself totally. She used to live outside Hyderabad with some persons for days together leaving the child in the house. All efforts for reconciliation proved futile. Ultimately, the respondent without the knowledge of the appellant left the house on 29-10-1978 leaving the child in the house and never returned to the matrimonial home or joined the appellant. 3. The respondent, in her counter-affidavit, denied that their married life was very happy. She alleges that it was unsuccessful and miserable. She alleges that the appellant was impotent and he forced her to extra-marital relationship with one Narasimha Reddy and have a child through him so that the appellant can claim to be the father of the child. He induced the respondent to this life and even made attempts to kill the respondent in order to cover up his impotency. She admits that she was forced to leave the house with the child anticipating danger to their lives at the hands of the appellant, But the appellant came to the house of the respondent when she was away and carried away the child. She was, therefore, forced to file a petition for the custody of the minor child under the Guardians and Wards Act. However, that petition was dismissed and the appellant continued to have the custody of the child. The respondent even while denying the allegations made against her, when the matter came up for trial, both the parties agreed to a divorce by consent, but contested the matter on the question of custody of the child, which the Court was bound to decide under S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In this behalf, the learned Additional Judge directed the custody of the child to be with the mother at least till the child crosses the age of five years. 4. The controversy between the parties as to the custody of the child has to be resolved having regard to two very important facts, firstly, what is the effect of the order of the Chief Judge, City Civil Court, dated 28-9-79, made in O. P. No. 300 of 1979 filed under the Guardians and Wards Act and secondly, whether the child is legitimate or illegitimate.Ravur Venkata Subbaiah vs Meruga Kamalamma on 23 April, 1982 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/504744/ 15. So far as the first point is concerned, it would be seen that while the child was in fact in the custody of the father, the mother filed for a declaration and to appoint her as the guardian of the person and property of the minor under S. 10 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act read with Ss. 7 and 11 of the Guardians and Wards Act. The question that was posed for consideration by the learned Chief Judge, City Civil Court, was whether the petitioner-respondent is entitled to be appointed as guardian of her minor child and whether it is in the interests of the minor to give her the custody of the minor child. Having regard to the evidence brought on record that the wife was living with her paramour, G. Narasimha Reddy, who is himself having a wife and children, the court did not think it proper and in the interests of the child to take it away from the custody of the father and entrust it to the mother. In the result the Court dismissed her petition, even though the child was one and half years old. That was at a time when the marriage was subsisting. The contention of Mr. M. R. K. Choudary, the learned counsel for the appellant, in this regard is that once an order under S. 10 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act read with Ss. 7 and 11 of the Guardians and Wards Act is made, that order operates as res judicata and in any event it must prevail and no order contrary to that could be made in a petition for divorce under S. 13 read with S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. So far as the earlier petition for appointment of the mother as guardian of the minor child is concerned, that petition was made while the marriage was subsisting and the question before the court then was while the marriage is subsisting and the wife, i.e., the mother of the child is living in adultery, whether it is advisable to remove the child then from the custody of the father and give it over to the mother. The question whether the child was legitimate or illegitimate or whether it was born outside the wedlock or within was not gone into. The marriage itself was subsisting though not successful. Moreover the Court was not called upon to decide, who among the two, namely, the father and mother, should be appointed as guardian. Only the petition of the mother for having the custody of the child was dismissed. The father was not appointed as guardian by the Court. That order made in the circumstances then existing and based on a different cause of action, in our opinion cannot operate as res judicata so as to bar the Court from exercising jurisdiction under the Hindu Marriage Act and make an order under S. 26 as to the custody of the minor child while granting a decree for divorce. The cause of action for now making an order as to the custody of the child is the dissolution of the marriage. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, (Act 32 of 1956 which is an Act supplemental to the Guardians and Wards Act) with the receipt of the assent of the President came into force on 25th Aug. 1956. S. 5 gives an overriding effect to the Act over any other law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act and that Act will cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act. The Hindu Marriage Act (Act 25 of 1955) came into force even earlier on 18th May, 1955. S. 4 thereof also gives an overriding effect to the provisions of this Act in the same terms as the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act makes no express provision as to what order should be made while directing the dissolution of the marriage. It makes provision for the appointment of a guardian of a Hindu minor. The provision contained in the Hindu Marriage Act under S. 26 is a special provision empowering the Court to Order the custody of the child while making a decree in any proceeding under the Act. When there is no specific order appointing the father as guardian, in our view, it is this provision that has to prevail. It is unnecessary for our present purpose whether, even after such an order is made, an application under S. 10 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act read with Ss. 7 and 11 of the Guardians and Wards Act could be made by the father for the custody of the child.

Galloway, (1955) 3 All ER 429 the House of Lords in a case arising under the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1950, where the language used in S. 26 (1) of the said Act is almost similar to the language used in S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, held that an order for custody of an illegitimate child of the parties born two years prior to their marriage could properly be made under that Section. The expression 'child' occurring in S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act would cover both a legitimate and an illegitimate child and therefore the Court has jurisdiction (vide WEBB v. WEBB, (1952) 1 All ER 527). We are, therefore, clearly of the view that the order of the learned Chief Judge in O. P. No. 300 of 1979 does not operate as res judicata so as to bar the Court from exercising jurisdiction under S. 13 read with S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act for making a suitable order as to the custody of the child. The cause of action and the basis for this order and the circumstances which had to be taken into consideration are totally different from those that form the basis for the order of the learned Chief Judge, City Civil Court in O. P. No. 300/1979. 6. The next question to be considered is whether the child should be in the custody of the father or the mother, the respondent herein. The learned Additional Judge has directed the custody of the child to be with the mother. 7. Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, lays down as under :- ""The natural guardians of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor's person as well as in respect of the minor's property, (excluding his or her undivided interest in joint family property) are :- (a) in the case of a boy or an unmarried girl - the father , and after him, the mother; provided that the custody of a minor who has not completed the age of five years shall ordinarily be with the mother. (b) in the case of an illegitimate boy or an illegitimate unmarried girl - the mother, and after her, the father; (c) in the case of a married girl - the husband; Provided that no person shall be entitled to act as the natural guardian of a minor under the provisions of this section- (a) if he has ceased to be a Hindu, or (b) if he has completely and finally renounced the world by becoming a hermit (vanaprastha) or an ascetic (yati or sanyasi).

A question of some importance arises for decision in this case. It concerns the consequence of the repeal by Section 7 of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975 of the Acts mentioned in the Schedule. One of the Acts so repealed is the Travancore Nair Act 2 of 1100. That Act provides among other things, for dissolution of a marriage solemnised under the Act. It specifies grounds for dissolution of marriage and also prescribes the procedure by which the right to seek dissolution is to be exercised. The court to which proceedings would lie is also specified. The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 provides in Section 13, for dissolution of Hindu Marriages. The grounds for dissolution are specified in this Act and the procedure for seeking dissolution is also specified in the Act. The grounds for dissolution under the Hindu Marriages Act are not identical with the grounds for divorce in the Nair Act 1100. 2. Notwithstanding the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 the provisions of the Nair Act 1100 for dissolution of marriage continued to be operative. Now that the Nair Act 1100 has been repealed by Act 30 of 1976 and the repealing Act does not embody any saving provision, the question that arises is whether proceedings pending before courts on the date of such repeal would be saved and the cases could be disposed of as if the Nair Act continued to be in force. The court below before which a petition under Section 5 of the Nair Act for divorce was pending has upheld the preliminary objection raised by the respondent that by the passing of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act 1975 the Nair Act 1100 has ceased to be operative and in the absence of any provision to keep alive the proceedings pending at the time of repeal such proceedings must terminate. Accordingly the petition has been dismissed and this appeal is against that order. 3. The view taken by the court below is supported by a judgment of our learned brother Vadakkel J., in Madhavan Nair v. Radhamony, (1979 Ker LT 61). The learned Judge has referred to an unre-ported decision of one of us, Janaki Amma, J. in C. B. P. No. 1629 of 1976 (Ker). The correctness of the decision of our learned Brother Vadakkel J. has been canvassed in this appeal. 4. The Hindu Marriage Act 1955 provided in Section 4 for the overriding effect of the Act in certain cases. Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 read thus. ""4. Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,-- (a) any text rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act;Gopalakrishnan Nair vs R. Sarasamma on 5 June, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181350/ 1(b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act."" We are here concerned not with any text rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act. Therefore Section 4 (a) has no application. Clause (b) of Section 4 of the Act rendered any law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act inoperative in so far as such Act was inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. But this was expressly subject to provision ""Save as otherwise expressly provided in the Act."" Therefore in examining the question whether any provisions of a special enactment ceased to have effect because of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, two questions have to be examined and they are (1) whether the provision in the enactment is inconsistent with the provisions in the Hindu Marriage Act (2) If so is there any express provision otherwise in the Act which keeps alive such law despite the inconsistency. Section 29 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act provides thus : ""29 (1) ..... (2) Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect any right recognised by custom or conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu marriage, whether solemnised be-fore or after the commencement of this Act. (3) & (4) ....."" The express provision in the sub-section would save the rights recognised by custom conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of Hindu marriage. Therefore if there was a special enactment in force which conferred a right to obtain dissolution, the provision with regard to dissolution of marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act would not affect such right. The field of operation of the right to dissolution conferred under the Hindu Marriage Act was restricted in its scope by reason of Section 29 (2) of the Act. It was operative in all cases other than those to which Section 29 (2) would apply. In other words the right to obtain dissolution under the Hindu Marriage Act did not extend to cases where provision has been made for that purpose in special enactments. In such cases the special enactment would continue to operate. The words ""nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect any right"" in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Act clearly indicate the limited scope of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, limited in the sense that it will not override the provisions in special enactments conferring right to obtain dissolution of Hindu marriage. In that view the provisions of the Nair Act which conferred a right to obtain dissolution of marriage on certain specific grounds and by resort to a specific procedure would remain in force not because such right was conferred by Section 29 (2) but Section 29 (2) limits the operation of Section 13 to cases other than those covered, among other laws by Nair Act 1100. In that view Section 4 (b) will not be applicable, for, that renders any law inoperative only in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision contained in the Act. Nair Act is not inconsistent with any provision contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, for, Section 13 limited in its operation to cases other than those covered by Section 29 (2) would not be inconsistent with cases covered by Section 29 (2). In other words the provisions of Nair Act concerning the right to obtain dissolution of marriage are not inconsistentGopalakrishnan Nair vs R. Sarasamma on 5 June, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181350/ 2with Section 13 of the Act. 5. The continuance of rights of parties to seek dissolution under Nair Act is not because of any right conferred by Hindu Marriage Act but because of the special provision in the Act that the provision regarding dissolution of marriages under that Act would not apply to cases governed by special enactments. The Nair Act ceased to be operative by reason of its subsequent repeal by Act 30 of 1976. Till then petitions for divorce could be filed under the Nair Act, tried and disposed of. That was a right available to parties because relevant provisions of that Act were in force as stated earlier. They were in force by their own right and not because of any provision in any other enactment. When once the Nair Act is repealed and proceedings under the Act are pending on the date of such repeal whether they could be continued under that Act has to be decided with reference to the provisions of the repealing statute read along with Section 4 of the Inter-pretation and General Clauses Act 1125, corresponding to Section 6 of the General Clauses (Central) Act 1897. Section 4 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act 1125 provides for the effect of repeal. That reads thus: 4. ""Effect of repeal -- Where any Act repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not- (a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or (b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed ; or (d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so repealed; or (e) affect any investigation, legal proceedings or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act had not been passed."" Unless a different intention appears the repeal will not affect any legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any right and such proceeding or remedy may be continued or enforced as if the repealing Act had not been passed. It may be that the repealing statute indicates an intention expressly or impliedly to keep alive proceedings under the provisions repealed. It may be that it indicates an intention not to keep alive the proceedings which are pending. In either case there would not be any difficulty. The intention must necessarily be decisive. But there may be cases where the repealing Act is silent. No contrary intention appears in such a case. The silence in the repealing Act cannot be taken to be an indication of a contrary intention. Those are cases of simple repeal. In such cases if the court finds that no contrary intention is indicated in the repealing enactment the position would be that pending proceedings would survive as if the repealed provision continued to be in force.

The appellant was respondent before the Addl.Prl.Judge, Family Court, Bangalore in M.C No. 642 of 1989 and being aggrieved by the decree of divorce granted in the said case has preferred this Appeal. 2. Parties shall hereafter be referred to with reference to their ranks in the lower Court or husband and wife as the occasion may demand. The petitioner filed the petition under Section 13(1)(1a) of the Hindu Marriage Act (for snort 'the Act') seeking a decree for divorce to dissolve his marriage with the respondent. The case put forward by him in brief, is as follows: He married the respondent on 19-6-1988 at Bangalore and out of the said wedlock a female child was born. The respondent lived with the petitioner for a short period of only 4 to 5 months and even during the said period her actual residence with him was only for a few days as she used to go away to her parents house at Viveknagar quite often and that too without the consent of either himself or his mother. She had treated him with cruelty and caused him great mental agony and physical exertion. Despite the fact that petitioner tolerated that kind of attitude on the part of his wife, she did not change her attitude towards him or towards other members of the family. She has not shown any interest in the domestic work and was also not assisting her mother-in-law in any domestic work. She used to keep herself in a room closed and whenever she was out of the room she was quarrelling either with the petitioner or with his mother and used to create a scene by threatening that she would commit suicide. All the members of the family were always kept under tension. She had superiority complex and she was mentioning that she was a post graduate and she could earn more than Rs. 2,000/- and was stating that she would not care for any of the members of the family. One of the conditions under which he married the respondent was that she should not take up any appointment. But contrary to the assurance, she was seeking for a job and in fact had later joined as a lecturer in the Vidya Vardaka Sangha, First Grade College for Women, West of Chord Road, Bangalore. After getting that job, she had left the company of the petitioner voluntarily and she has not shown any intention of joining him. The respondent did not even inform him about the birth of the child. She had no mind to live with the petitioner. When all the efforts to bring her around failed, he issued a legal notice dated 11th September, 1989 and called upon her to join him or in the alternative to join him for presenting a Petition for divorce by consent but she has not done either. The respondent had deprived him the love and affection of his choice. Therefore, the petitioner sought for a decree of divorce. 'After service of notice of the petition, the respondent entered appearance through her Advocate one Shri S.R. and the case was posted for objection and for counselling to 22.3,1990. On that day, as time was prayed for by the learned Advocate for the petitioner the case was posted for counselling to 10.4.1990, On that date the respondent was absent and objections were not filed and the case was posted to 12.4.1990. On that date again the respondent was absent. The petitioner was directed to file an affidavit in support of his case and heH.S. Uma vs G.K. Sumanth Arya on 8 April, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1391704/ 1filed one on the next date. Subsequently by perusing the Petition and the affidavit filed in support of the Petition, the learned Judge of the Family Court passed an order allowing the Petition. It is being aggrieved by this order of the learned Judge of the Family Court, the respondent has preferred this Appeal. 3. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that her learned Advocate who was appearing in the Family Court could not make proper representation on her behalf on account of her personal inconvenience and the trial Court without posting the matter to a further date has proceeded to pass an exparte order and therefore the said order is liable to be set aside. It was secondly contended that under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court before granting the relief should make every endeavour to bring about reconciliation between the parties and the records of the Family Court do not indicate that any such endeavour was made by it to find out whether reconciliation could be made. It was further urged that even on the very averments made in the Petition which have been again sworn to by the petitioner, there is absolutely no scope to hold that a case had been made out to grant divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Therefore, it was urged that the order granting divorce should be set aside and the matter should be remitted back to the Family Court with a direction to afford opportunity to the appellant to file her objection statement and thereafter to give opportunity to both the sides to adduce evidence and thereafter to dispose of the case according to law. 4. The learned Advocate for the respondent urged that there is no substance in any one of these contentions and it was also urged that the case was posted on more than one occasion and the appellant and her Advocate were absent and therefore the Family Court was left with no other alternative but to proceed to hear the matter exparte. It was further urged that having regard to the fact that respondent and her Counsel were absent, there was no scope for the Family Court to find out whether the parties could reconcile their differences. The contention that even if all the averments made by the petitioner are accepted no case is made out for grant of divorce under the relevant Section has also been disputed. It was also urged that subsequent to the divorce granted by the trial Court, the petitioner has married and a child is also born out of the said wedlock and if the order of the trial Court is to be set aside it would affect the valid second marriage of the petitioner and in that view of the matter, even if a case is made out for setting aside the order of the trial Court, it should not be set aside having regard to this subsequent event. 5. On these contentions the short Points that arises for Consideration are: 1. Whether a case is made out for setting aside the impugned order and remand of the case to the Family Court? 2. Whether the impugned order is not liable to be set aside on account of the alleged subsequent event of the second marriage of the petitioner? 6. The order sheet of the lower Court indicates that on 16.1.1990 one Smt. S.R. undertook to file vakalat for respondent and the case was posted for filing vakalat and objections to 13.2.1990. On that day the case was adjourned to 22.3.1990 for counselling. On 22.3.1990 the learned Advocate forH.S. Uma vs G.K. Sumanth Arya on 8 April, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1391704/ 2the petitioner prayed for time and therefore it was posted to 10.4.1990. On that day the respondent was absent and objections were not filed. The case was adjourned to 12.4.1990. Again, on that date, the respondent was absent and the petitioner was directed to file an affidavit in support of his case and the case was adjourned to 16.4.1990. On that day the affidavit was filed on behalf of the petitioner and the case was posted for orders on 20.4.1990 and as on that date the orders were not ready it was again adjourned to 21.4.1990 and orders were pronounced on that day allowing the petition. It may be noticed that though from 10.4.1990 the case was adjourned four times before the Petition was allowed the dates were given at very short intervals and hardly eleven days had expired from the date on which the respondent was absent to the date on which the orders were pronounced. Though the affidavit of the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent before the trial Court has not been filed before us, the personal inconvenience of that Advocate adverted to in the course of the Appeal Memorandum has not been seriously disputed on behalf of the petitioner. In fact at one stage the learned Advocate for the petitioner had to practically concede that but for the subsequent event he would not have been in a position to seriously resist the prayer made on behalf of the respondent to set aside the order of the trial Court and for remand of the case. 7. Apart from the fact that no proper representation could be made on behalf of the respondent before the Family Court on account of the personal inconvenience of her learned Advocate, the order is liable to be set aside because no endeavour as contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act has been made for finding out whether the parties could reconcile their differences. Section 9(1) of the Family Courts Act, which refers to the duty of the Family Court to make efforts for settlement, reads as hereunder: ""In every suit or proceedings, endeavour shall be made by the Family Court in the first instance, where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case, to assist and persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding and for this purpose a Family Court may, subject to any rules made by the High Court, follow such procedure as it deem fit."" Section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act which again refers to the duty | of the Court to bring about reconciliation between the parties reads as hereunder: ""Before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court in the first instance, in every case where it is possible so to do consistently with the nature and circumstances of the case, to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties."" It may be noticed that in contra distinction to just the word ""endeavour"" mentioned in Section 9(1) of the Family Courts Act, in Section 23(2), a duty is cast on the Court in the first instance to make every endeavour. The use of the word ""every"" before the word ""endeavour"" in this Section assumes great importance in respect of the duty cast on the Court dealing with a proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act to bring about reconciliation. 8. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner-husband that in a case, where the other party is absent there is absolutely no scope for the Court to make any endeavour to reconcile the differencesH.S.

Bhatt, J. 1. This revision application under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, ('Code' for short hereinafter) the petitioner-original applicant, wife, has questioned the legality and validity of the composite order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, at Mehsana, on 30-10-19S5, in Criminal Revision Application Nos. 163 of 1984 and 74 of 1985. 2. The resume of the material fact giving rise to the present revision, may be. shortly stated at this stage so as to appreciate the merits of the present revision and challenge against it. The petitioner is the original applicant-wife. who initiated legal battle by filing a Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 42 of 1982 in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, at Patan. under Section 125 of the Code for her maintenance, against the respondent No. 1. Rameshkumar Ratilal Patani, who is the original opponents-husband. They are hereinafter referred to as ""husband"" and ""wife"" for the sake of convenience and brevity. 3. The marriage of spouses took place, on 29-5-1975, according to the Hindu rites, at Patan. The wife thereafter went to her husband's house at Mount Abu. where her husband was serving as an Officer at that time. On account of disharmony and dissatisfaction between the spouses, the wife went to the place of her parents. The husband instituted a petition for divorce against the wife under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act in District Court, at Pali, in Rajasthan. The wife Hansaben resorted to the provisions of Section 125 by filing aforesaid application for her maintenance alleging that she is entitled to maintenance as she is neglected and refused maintenance by her husband. The husband resisted the same application. On perusal of the facts and circumstances and evidence, the learned Trial Magistrate was pleased to fix maintenance at the rate of Rs. 125/- per month by passing an order, on 27-5-1983. There is no dispute about the fact that High Court of Rajasthan in a divorce petition under the Hindu Marriage Act had also fixed an interim alimony at the rate of Rs, 125/- per month and had directed the husband to pay the same to the wife. The wife thereafter was constrained to file an application bearing No. 103 of 1983 for the enforcement of the maintenance order passed in her favour in Criminal Misc. Application No. 42 of 1982. It was filed, on 14-12-1983, under Section 125(3) of the Code. In which she has contended that her husband failed to comply with the order of maintenance and she claimed an amount of Rs. 750/- by way of arrears of maintenance and Rs. 60/- by way of cost of the maintenance application as awarded by the Trial Magistrate. Thus in all she claimed Rs. 810/- under Section 123(3) of the Code from her husband. After hearing both the parties the learned trial Magistrate was pleased to pass an order that opponent has to pay the maintenance amount as per the order passed under Section 125 of the Code, which reads as follows : ""Opponent has to pay the maintenance amount as per the order passed under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code.Hansaben Rameshkumar Patani vs Rameshkumar Ratilal Patani And ... on 18 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1721928/ 1Sd/- Judicial Magistrate First Class Patan"" Being aggreived by the said order of the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Patan. under Section 125(3) of the Code. The original opponent husband preferred a Criminal Revision Application No. 163 of 1984 in the Sessions Court at Mehsana. Later on he also challenged the maintenance order passed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 42 of 1982 by filing a Criminal Revision Application No. 74 of 1985.. The learned Additional Sessions Judge disposed of the aforesaid two Criminal Revision Applications filed by the respondent husband by passing a composite order, on 30-10-1985. As per the final order the learned Additional Sessions Judge at Mehsana allowed both the revision applications. He clarified the order of the learned Trial Magistrate in Criminal Misc. Application No. 42 of 1982 stating that applicant-wife is entitled to claim maintenance amount of Rs.125/-. However, the opponent husband will be entitled to set off any amount deposited in the Rajasthan Court or paid to the wife by the husband. Thereafter the learned J.M.F.C. at Patan was directed to dispose of the Criminal Misc. Application No. 107 of 1983 in the light of the order of that Court. It is this order that is, now, under challenge before this Court by the original applicant wife. 4. It appears that the clarification of the learned Additional Sessions Judge in the final order has created confusion. The clarification made by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in the final order as aforesaid is also not legal and valid. It was not open for the learned Additional Sessions Judge to clarify in the manner as it is done. Opponent husband would not be entitled to set off any amount deposited by him in Rajasthan Court or paid by him to the wife pursuant to an order passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act by way of interim alimony in a divorce petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It appears that the learned Additional Sessions Judge, with due respect to him, over looked the relevant provisions. An order under Section 125 of the Code for maintenance and an order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, are distinct orders in separate proceedings. It is not open for Court under Section 125 to grant set off any amount paid by the opponent husband to the wife or deposited in any Court against the substantive order passed under Section 125 of the Code. Order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is for interim alimony which would terminate on termination of the proceedings. Order under Section 125 of the Code is substantive order which can be terminated or altered only in the light of the provisions under Sec-125(3) or under Section 127 of the Code. Mere passing of an order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act for interim alimony would not operate as set off against the order of maintenance under Section 125 of the Code. There can be no difficulty on the part of the wife for pursuing remedies under both the provisions simultaneously. This proposition of law is very well settled. It appears that the attention of the learned Additional Sessions Judge was not drawn to this proposition of law. The nature of the respective case in both these proceedings are different. Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the concerned spouse has only to show that be or she has no independent source of income sufficient for his or her maintenance. Once this as shows, interim alimony can be awarded, keeping in mind the economic status and conditions of the respective parties. While in so far as the provision under Section 125 of the Code are concerned only one spouse, namely, the wife would be entitled to maintenance. She can be awarded maintenance if sheHansaben Rameshkumar Patani vs Rameshkumar Ratilal Patani And ... on 18 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1721928/ 2can show that she has no independent sources of income of her own. Of course, she has to show that she is refused and neglected maintenance by her husband and her husband has sufficient means to maintain her. In the facts and circumstances both the proceedings could be pursued by the wife and there is no ban or bar in any one of the provisions unlike provision under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, whereas, subsequent proceedings can be stayed if conditions under Section 10 are established. 5. Therefore it is always open for the wife to pursue both the remedies. The maintenance order passed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 42 of 1982 by learned J.M.F.C. Patan fixing maintenance at the rate of Rs. 125/- per month in favour of the wife is passed after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and especially the fact that interim alimony of Rs. 125/- was passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The amount of maintenance awarded to the wife at the rate of Rs. 125/-per month cannot be said to be unreasonable or unjustified. Wife is entitled to get the maintenance order enforced under the provisions of Section 125(3) of the Code. The maintenance amount was not paid as ordered by the Court and it was in arrears, and, therefore, wife was constrained to initiate enforcement proceedings by filing Criminal Misc. Application No. 107 of 1983 in respect of the amount of Rs. 810/-. The learned trial Magistrate was pleased to pass an order for enforcement of maintenance order under Section 125(3) of the Code on 15-9-1984 below Ex. l.of the said application for recovery of arrears of maintenance. Several contentions were raised on behalf of the opponent husband and they were all rejected. It was also contended that the wife was awarded interim alimony under Section 24 of the Code by the District Court at Pali in Rajasthan and therefore, application for enforcement of arrears of maintenance should not be granted. It was also contended in that proceedings that in view of the pendency of the proceedings between the parties no order may be passed. Having examined and considered rival contentions the order in application for enforcement for the arrears of maintenance, was passed. It was observed by the learned trial Magistrate that unless and until order under Section 125 of the Code is altered or modified the trial Magistrate Court can proceed for enforcement of the maintenance order. This view of the learned trial Magistrate appears to be fully justified. In fact the maintenance order fixing quantum at the rate of Rs. 125/- per month against the husband was passed considering all the relevant facts and circumstances including the factum of passing of interim alimony under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 6. Unfortunately, the learned Additional Sessions Judge while, making an attempt to clarify the order of maintenance created confusion which has resulted into miscarriage of justice. The Direction of the learned Additional Sessions Judge that wife will be entitled to only maintenance at the rate of Rs. 125/- it justified. However, the clarificatory direction that the said amount of Rs. 125/-will be subject to payment of any amount to the wife or any deposit of any amount in the Rajasthan Court is not justified. The observation of the learned Additional Sessions Judge that any amount deposited by the husband in the Rajasthan Court or any amount paid to the wife by the respondent pursuant to the order of interim alimony under Section 24 passed by the District Court at Rajasthan will be set off against the payment of Rs. 125/- per month fixed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 42 of 1982 is neither legal nor justified. Therefore. that part of the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge is required to be quashed.Hansaben Rameshkumar Patani vs Rameshkumar Ratilal Patani And ... on 18 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1721928/ 3","['10', '13', '24', '12']"

This is an appeal by the wife against the judgment and order passed by the Judge, City Civil Court, Bombay in M.J. Petition No. 107 of 1979 for judicial separation under section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which was dismissed. 2. A marriage was celebrated on 28th February, 1966 and there were two children, one born on 28th October, 1966 and the other on 20th September, 1968. The petitioner-wife's complaint against her husband-respondent was that her husband was suspicious of her, used to pick up quarrels on and off on minor trifle matters. Besides, he used to dominate her saying that he would not allow her to even have relations with any female outsiders. He used to look at her activities with suspicion. She then refers to an incident of the year 1971, when one Jadhav had come to her house and stopped there because it was raining. He was allowed to sit there. After sometime the husband-respondent came to the house, scolded her, and asked Jadhav to get out, abused her and also assaulted her. The husband also, according to her, suspected her of having friendship with one Lalji Mistry, who was her brother's family friend. Respondent used to make wild allegations against the petitioner that she was having intimacy and illicit relations with Lalji Mistry. He started making these allegations in the presence of everybody and called the petitioner of easy virtue. In 1976 while she was walking on the Cadel Road, she accidentally met Lalji and both were involved in an accident of motor car which had run them over. She was removed to the hospital and was in hospital. After her discharge from the hospital, she went and stayed at her mother's place and after some time came back to the matrimonial house. The respondent, however, continued to tease her and inflict mental agony on the petitioner by alleging that she was having intimacy and illicit relations with said Lalji. This went on till about March 1978. 3. In March 1978 the petitioner had gone for a function to her parent's place. That at that time the respondent came later, assaulted her and cast serious aspersions against the character of the petitioner. As she suggested the returning of the loan taken by the respondent from her brother, respondent took away from her the keys of the house and prohibited her from coming to his house, as he wanted no relations with the petitioner. The parties thus are staying separately from March 1978. Nevertheless, it is the contention of the petitioner that she used to receive threats of physical violence and of acid throwing by the respondent against her. She lodged a complaint at Mahim Police Station in April 1978. In August 1978 a notice was served upon the petitioner to which she replied on 31st August, 1978. The further reply to that reply was sent by the respondent-husband. It thereafter that in January 1979 the petitioner filed this petition on the ground of cruelty, on threats of physical violence by respondent to her and on that account the life of the petitioner had become miserable and impossible to continue with the husband. The two daughters who were living with her after the parties were separated, according to the petitioner, were taken away by the respondent. She sued, therefore, for divorce under section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and also for the custody ofKalpana Shripati Rao (Smt.) vs Shripati V. Rao on 14 March, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1216006/ 1the two minor children born out of the marriage. 4. The respondent denied the behaviour and conduct attributed to him. He denied that he was suspicious or was harassing or even assaulting the petitioner. He denied the incident about Jadhav as per petitioner's version and alleged that he had ''ample evidence to disprove the facts alleged by the petitioner in that behalf''. He contended that he could ''not be wrong and was justified if he expressed displeasure at the behaviour of the petitioner which was objectionable and she had undue intimacy or relation on her part with persons such as the said Jadhav and Lalji''. According to him, the story of the accidental meeting on Cadel Road with Lalji was absolutely false and can be proved on the basis of ''the report of the police and application before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal filed in this behalf''. He contended that the petitioner was ''licentious in her behaviour that she was thoroughly exposed by the accident'', and is also expressed by the petitioner herself in a diary where she confessed of her immoral acts and acknowledged them. 5. As regards the children he claimed that the custody was rightly given to him. It was he who looked after the children. That the petitioner did not look after them and it is undesirable in the circumstances of the petitioner's behaviour that the minor daughters should remain with her. He denied the incident also in March 1978 when he is alleged to have assaulted the petitioner or having stated that he wanted nothing to with her and denied the alleged incident at her mother's place. 6. He then proceeded to say that he thought the petitioner was doing serious mistakes and causing annoyance, wrath and displeasure to him, he was also looking towards her with love and affection and like dutiful husband ''he had pardoned her for the acts of infidelity and had always tried to persuade and bring her on right path''. According to him, petitioner was misguided and if she was brought out of the influence of such people then it is possible that she might return to the matrimonial house. 7. On the basis of these allegations, the parties went to the trial. The petitioner examined herself and her mother. Respondent satisfied by examining himself. Besides, the notices and replies exchanged between the parties were also produced during the course of the trial and the respondent also relied upon a diary which the petitioner seems to have been keeping for the year 1977 and relied upon the certain entries therein to substantiate his contentions. No other evidence either oral or documentary was produced. 8. The learned Judge held that the petitioner had failed to prove cruelty on the part of the husband. He seems to have held that the cruelty alleged viz. of false allegations of intimacy with Jadhav and Lalji was not proved, meaning thereby that there was no such intimacy between the petitioner and Jadhav and Lalji. He also held that the petitioner had failed to prove the assault, or abuses or threats given by the respondent. In that view of the matter, he dismissed the petitioner's petition and granted the custody of the children to the respondent. 9. On behalf of the petitioner-wife, the learned Counsel, who appeared, contended that the learned Judge was in error and was unnecessarily led away and imported his own view about what is proper and improper behaviour on the part of the wife. He contended that the judgment of the learnedKalpana Shripati Rao (Smt.) vs Shripati V. Rao on 14 March, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1216006/ 2Judge seems to have been influenced largely upon the background of the parties which he had taken for granted. He contended that though there was no evidence in that behalf, expecting the solitary statement on the part of the petitioner, the learned Judge drew freely a conclusion that the petitioner had grown in an atmosphere of freedom while the respondent came from orthodox surrounding. This according to the learned Counsel has considerably clouded the appreciation of the evidence and affected the conclusions reached by the learned Judge. 10. On evidence, the learned Counsel urged that there is absolutely no evidence and nothing to show that there was any intimacy, much less illicit connection or relations between the petitioner and Jadhav. The learned Judge has unnecessarily jumped to the conclusion presumably on the basis of what he thought. The petitioner was a free lady and should not have mixed generally and in this manner with persons from the other sex. What may at the most be a liberal and free behaviour has been construed as licentious illicit intimacy, not only by the husband but by the learned Judge. 11. As regards the two incidents in which Lalji was involved, it was pointed out that the first incident was totally innocuous. Lalji was a family friend and the petitioner knew him even before her marriage as the friend of her brother. She was on visiting terms with Lalji because of family relations and there was nothing wrong to go and ride in the car of Lalji. In the year 1974, if the petitioner had travelled along with Lalji to the house of the parties, it would be highly speculative and unjustifying guess-work to conclude from that they had intimate relations. The same is the position with regard to the second incident on Cadel Road. 12. The learned Counsel further pointed out that the entry in the diary upon which reliance was placed is a solitary entry. The petitioner's contention in that behalf is that she was forced to write that entry. The entry is much later than the incident and does not convey anything except a vague statement in regard to some alleged sin. In the absence of anything to indicate, and in the absence of any explanation in cross-examination of the petitioner with regard to the statements in that diary, from the entry, it was hazardous to come to the conclusion that an admission could be spelt out of illicit intimacy with Lalji therefrom. 13. An unjustified allegation of infidelity or misbehaviour and particularly of immorality on the part of the wife by the husband is mental cruelty, which the petitioner had undergone. In the present case the mental torture must have naturally disturbed her peace of mind and physique as well as endurance and patience and thereby must have produced anxiety and tension. The result would be mental unhappiness and ill-health. The learned Counsel further submitted that under the amendment to the Hindu Marriage Act of the year 1976, it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove that the cruelty was of such character as to put the petitioner in danger of life or limb as was required under the former section 10(1)(b) of the Act. It was not necessary for the petitioner to prove that ''it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party''. Even otherwise it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the evidence in the witness-box of the petitioner supported by the mother indicated that the respondent was of violent temperament, capable of physical outrage, short-tempered and was of aggressive disposition. That he had assuaged the petitioner and had threatened her, on account of which she lodged the complaint at Mahim Police Station. That the respondent was behaving towards the petitioner in this manner evenKalpana Shripati Rao (Smt.) vs Shripati V.

179,"Bombay High Court Sitabai Ramchandra Todankar vs Ramchandra Raghunath Todankar on 2 July, 1957 Equivalent citations: AIR 1958 Bom 116, (1957) 59 BOMLR 885, ILR 1958 Bom 190 Author: Chagla Bench: Chagla, S Desai, K Desai JUDGMENT Chagla, C.J. 1. This Full Bench has to consider a rather important question as to the right of a Hindu to obtain divorce on the ground of desertion, which right was given to him under the Born-bay Hindu Divorce Act of 1947 and which was taken away by the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. 2. The facts which give rise to the Full Bench are briefly these. The respondent, who is the husband, filed a petition for judicial separation before the City Civil Court on the ground that his wife, the appellant, had deserted him for a continuous period of four years from 22nd December 1950. An application for amendment of this petition was made and the amendment effected was that the petitioner sued for divorce on the ground of desertion under the Bombay Act. The learned City Civil Court Judge took the view that in view of this amendment the Court had no jurisdiction. The plaint was then presented before Mr. Justice Coyajee and the question raised before him was whether the High Court had jurisdiction to try the suit. The learned Judge came to the conclusion that the petition for divorce was properly filed under the Bombay Act, that under the Bombay Act the High Court had jurisdiction and he transferred the suit to the City Civil Court under the Bombay Matrimonial (Transfer of Cases) Act of 1950. It is against this judgment that an appeal was preferred. The appeal came before my brother Mr. Justice Section T. Desai and myself and we took the view that as the decision raised a rather important question and as there was a judgment of a Division Bench which required consideration a Full Bench should be constituted. 3. Now, the question that we have to consider is whether by reason of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 (Act 25 of 1955), it is competent for the plaintiff to maintain this petition for divorce on the ground of desertion. Turning to the provisions of the two Acts, the Bombay Hindu Divorce Act of 1947 mentioned in Section 3 as one of the grounds for divorce that the defendant had deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of four years. Under this Act ""Court"" was denned in Greater Bombay as the High Court in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction and elsewhere, the Court of a District Judge, and hence if a suit had to be filed for divorce in Bombay it had to be filed in the High Court on its Original Side. This Act also dealt with suits for judicial separation under Section 4 and it may be noted that desertion was not one of the grounds on which judicial separation could be obtained. When we turn to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, it is necessary to observe that this was an Act to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus. It is a well known fact of which judicial notice may be taken that Parliament was anxious to bring about uniformity in the various provisions of law in different parts of India regulating Hindu marriages. Therefore, the Act aimed at uniformity and codification and at social reform. Under this Act ""divorce"" was dealt with under Section 13 and desertion was not constituted a ground for divorce, only a decree for judicial Separation could be obtained on the ground of desertion, and under S. 10(1) either party to a marriage may present a petition for judicial separation on the ground that the other party has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding theSitabai Ramchandra Todankar vs Ramchandra Raghunath Todankar on 2 July, 1957 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1783166/ 1presentation of the petition. But desertion, apart from entitling the party deserted to a decree for judicial separation, also entitled him to -a decree for divorce under Section 13(1)(viii) when the party who deserted had not resumed cohabitation for a space of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation against that party. Therefore, the scheme under the Hindu Marriage Act was that the petitioner could obtain a decree for judicial separation two years after desertion, and if there was no cohabitation for a further period of two years after the passing of that decree he could apply for divorce and obtain it. Therefore, it may be said that really in sub-Stance there was not much difference between the provisions of the Bombay Act and the Hindu Marriage Act because in both cases there had to be a continuous period of desertion for four years, the difference being that under the Hindu Marriage Act divorce was obtained by two stages, first a decree for judicial separation and then a decree for divorce, whereas under the Bombay Act a party could straightaway proceed to obtain divorce after desertion had continued for a period of four years. Then Section 19 dealt with jurisdiction and procedure and under this section every petition had to be presented to the District Court, which was defined as a City Civil Court in those area where a City Civil Court had been set up, and therefore every petition under this Act had to be presented to the City Civil Court. Then Section 29 dealt with savings and we are concerned with sub-s. (2); ""Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to effect any right recognised by custom or conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu Marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act."" Sub-section (3) saves proceedings which were pending under any law for the time being in force and such proceedings were to be continued and determined as if this Act had not been passed. Sub-section (4) dealt with the Special Marriage Act of 1954 with which we are not concerned. Section 30 repealed various Acts among which is the Bombay Hindu Divorce Art of 1947. Therefore, it seems to us clear that reading Section 30 and Section 29(2) together what the Legislature intended was that having repealed certain specific Acts passed in various ""parts of India, the Legislature wanted to save rights of divorce which were granted to parties under those laws which had not been repealed by Section 30. As the right of divorce was being for the first time granted to all Hindus in India under the Hindu Marriage Act, the Legislature did not in any way want to restrict the right of divorce already enjoyed by certain sections of the people under certain special laws, and therefore, although the desire and anxiety for uniformity was there as it was revealed by the repealing Section 30, under Section 29(2) to the extent that a right to obtain dissolution of marriage was conferred by any law not repealed under Section 30 that right was saved and preserved by Section 29(2). 4. Now, in our opinion, it is not possible to contend and not possible to accept the con-: tention that Section 29(2) dealt with the Bombay; Act of 1947 and that this sub-section saves the right to obtain dissolution of marriage con-; ferred by the Bombay Act. If Section 30 had not been enacted, it was possible to urge that the Legislature intended to save rights conferred by the Bombay Act. But when there is an express repeal of the Bombay Act under Section 30, the only taw or laws to which Section 29 (2) can refer are laws which do not come within the ambit of Section 30, which have not been repealed and which deal with dissolution of a Hindu marriage. It is a matter of common knowledge that apart from the laws dealt with under Section 30 there are other laws and there are customsSitabai Ramchandra Todankar vs Ramchandra Raghunath Todankar on 2 July, 1957 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1783166/ 2under which sections of Hindu citizens of this country have been exercising their right to obtain divorce and dissolution of marriage. 5. There is one other section to which reference might be made and that is Section 4 which has a characteristic marginal note ""Overriding effect of Act"". Therefore, the section was intended to provide that the provisions of the Act were to override all statutory and customary laws to the extent that they dealt with or were inconsistent with the matters dealt with by the Act, and the section provides: ""Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, (a) any text, rule, or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law In force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision Is made in this Act; (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall Cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act."" Therefore, the Legislature having expressly repealed certain Acts by Section 30 had to deal with other laws which continued on the statute book and which might have provisions with regard to matters dealt with in this Act and with regard to those laws express provision was made under Section 4(b). that those lairs to the extent that they dealt with matters which were inconsistent with the provisions of this Act shall cease to have effect and force; that means the laws were not repealed but the provisions in those laws which were inconsistent with the provisions of this Act ceased to have any validity. And with regard to Section 4(a) inasmuch as the text of Hindu Law would naturally have dealt with questions of marriage and divorce a provision was enacted that any such text or rule of Hindu Law shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for' which provision was made in this Act. Therefore, with regard to matters dealt with by this Act this was the only law one could look to and not any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law. Therefore, really, the provision in Section 4(a), if anything, was more drastic than the provision in Section 4(b) of the Act. But inasmuch as 'the Bombay Act has been repealed by Section 30, neither Section 4(b) nor Section 29(2) can refer to the provisions of that Act, and therefore the only possible position that can be taken and which has been taken by Mr. Shah is that the Bom-bay Act being repealed we must give effect to the provisions of the General Clauses Act which deals with the consequences of a statute being repealed by the Legislature. 6. What is urged is that under Section 6 of the General Clauses Act the repeal of the Bombay Act cannot affect any right acquired by the petitioner. It is pointed out that no contrary or different intention has been made to appear in the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 that the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act should not apply. Now, we will assume that the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act have application, but the Question still remains as to whether the petitioner in this case did acquire any right which was saved notwithstanding the repeal of the Bombay Act, and what is urged is that the right which was acquired was the right to obtain a divorce on the ground of desertion. The argument is put this way that the parties having married some timeSitabai Ramchandra Todankar vs Ramchandra Raghunath Todankar on 2 July, 1957 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1783166/ 3","['6', '4', '3', '19', '13', '30', '29']"

A Hindu wife aggrieved by her husband's conduct in marrying a second wife laid a complaint against him for an offence under Section 494, I. P. C. , read with Sections 11 and 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In this application under Section 561-A, Criminal P. C. the husband seeks to have the proceedings against him quashed on the ground that Sections 11 and 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act are ultra vires and unconstitutional as they offend Article 15 (1) of the Constitution. We may at once state that though the Act has been on the statute book for fifteen years no one thought worth while all these years to challenge the vires of these provisions either in this court or elsewhere. It has not fallen to this petitioner to question the vires of these provisions. 2. Sri P. A. Chowdary, learned counsel for the petitioner, argued that while the personal law of the Hindus prior to 1955 and the personal law of the Muslims always permitted polygamy, the Hindu Marriage Act made the Hindu marriage monogamous while the Muslim marriage was left untouched. The effect of making the Hindu marriage monogamous was that it exposed Hindus to Section 494, I. P. C. while Muslims continued unexposed. A statute which so exposed Hindus to a prosecution under Section 494, I. P. C. to which they would not be so exposed if they are Muslims, was a statute which discriminated against Hindus on the ground of their religion only and, therefore, offended Article 15 (1) of the Constitution. Sri Chowdary urged that a provision which made the same act an offence if committed by a Hindu but not so if committed by a Muslim was patently discriminatory on the ground of religion only. He contended that a criminal law, unlike personal law, must be uniform and that it was not permissible to have one criminal law for the Hindus and another criminal law for the Muslims. He contended that it was permissible to amend personal laws but submitted that it was not open to the Legislature under the guise of amending one of the several personal laws prevailing in the land, to subject the persons governed by that personal law to a penal law without at the same time subjecting others governed by other personal laws to the same penal law. He further urged that a law which made an act an offence if committed by a person subject to a particular personal law but not by others hurt the unity ad integrity of the nation and was destructive of the secular character of the State. He draw our attention to Article 44 of the Constitution which prescribes that the State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India. 3. To understand and consider the submissions made by the learned counsel, it will be useful if we refer to the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions and their extent and scope. Article 14 of the Constitution assures to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. It is now well settled that while Article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid a reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation, provided that the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia and that differentia has a rational relation to the object of the statute. The classifications may be founded on different bases such as geographical, historical, occupational orGogireddy Sambireddy vs Gogireddy Jayamma And Anr. on 7 July, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/547018/ 1the like. It may even be based on religion. See for instance the case of Moti Das v. S. P. Sahi where it was held that the exclusion of Sikh religious trusts from the applicability of the Bihar Hindu religious Trusts Act did not offend Article 14 of the Constitution as the organisation of Sikh religious trusts was essentially different from the organisation of Hindu Religious trusts and the Legislature apparently thought that Sikh religious trusts did not require the same protections as Hindu Religious trusts. On the same analogy it must be held the Legislature may determine which religious community is ready for social reform and make laws accordingly. 4. But Article 15 (1) of the Constitution says, ""the State shall not discriminate against the citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them."" Thus while religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth may furnish a legitimate basis for classification for the purposes of Article 14 so far as citizens are concerned, Article 15 (1) forbids a classification on the ground only of religion, race caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. It should also be noted that while the word ""discriminate"" is not used in Article 14, the expression ""discriminate against"" is C. J., explained the distinction between Article 14 and Article 15 in Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra, , He said: ""All legislative differentiation is not necessarily discriminatory. In fact, the word ""discrimination' does not occur in Article 14. The expression 'discriminate against' is used in Article 15 (1) and Article 16 (2) and it means, according to the Oxford Dictionary, ""to make an adverse distinction with regard to; to distinguish unfavorably from others."" Discrimination thus involved an element of unfavorable bias and it is in that sense the expression has to be understood in this context. If such bias is disclosed and is based on any of the grounds mentioned in Articles 15 and 15, it may well be that the statute will, without more, incur condemnation as violating a specific constitutional prohibition unless it is saved by one or other of the provisos to those Articles. But the position under Article 14 is different. Equal protection claims under that Article are examined with the presumption that the State action is reasonable and justified. This presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the Legislature must, of necessity, possess in making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons in order to give effect to its policies."" 5. Next., the expression used in Article 15 (1) is 'on grounds only of' and not the expression 'on grounds of'. The word 'only' is significant. It shows that the discrimination forbidden by the Article is discrimination based solely on the ground of religion etc, and on other ground. If the discrimination is based on other grounds as well then Article 15 (1) does not hit the statute. In Anjali Roy v. State of West Bengal, Chakravarti, C. J., observed: ""Of paramount important in clause (1) are the words ""discrimination"" and "" only"". What the article forbids is discrimination and discrimination based solely on all or any of the grounds mentioned in the Article. All differentiation in the Article. All differentiation is not discrimination, but only such differentiation as is invidious and as is made, no because any real difference in the conditions or natural difference between the persons dealt with makes different treatment necessary, but because of the presence of some characteristic or affiliation which is either disliked or not regarded with equal favour but which has no rational connection with the differentiation made as a justifyingGogireddy Sambireddy vs Gogireddy Jayamma And Anr. on 7 July, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/547018/ 2reason. Next, the discrimination which is forbidden is only such discrimination as is based solely on the ground that a person belongs to a particular race or caste or professes a particular religion or was born at a particular place or is of a particular sex and no other ground. A discrimination based on one or more of these grounds and also on other grounds is not hit by the Article."" Similarly in Yusuf Abdul Aziz v. State, , Chagla, C. J., and Gajendragadkar, J. said, ""Now, it is apt very often to be overlooked that Article 15 (1) speaks of discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. If religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth is merely one of the factors which the Legislature has taken into consideration, then it would not be discrimination only on ground of that fact, but if the Legislature has discriminated only on one of those grounds and no other factor could possibly have been present, then undoubtedly the law would offend against Article 15 (1)."" Like observations were made in Dattatreya v. State of Bombay, and State v. Vithal, AIR 1952 Bom 451. The decisions in ; and were noticed by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in State of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society, . Their Lordships did not disapprove the decisions but distinguished them on the ground that those cases were concerned with Article 15 (1) of the Constitution while they were considering Article 29 (2). They pointed out that while Article 15 (1) dealt with discrimination generally Article 29 92) dealt with denial of admission into educational institutions of certain kinds. They held that irrespective of the object of the statute, if the immediate ground and direct cause for the denial of admission into the specified educational institutions was religion race, caste or language of the citizen, then there was a denial of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 29 (2). The position therefore is that in order to successfully claim the right under Article 15 (1) of the Constitution it must be shown that there is discrimination and not mere differentiation, that the discrimination is based on grounds of race, religion, caste, sex or place of birth and that no other considerations contributed to the discrimination. Even if the rule applicable to cases coming under Article 29 (2) is applied to cases under Article 15 (1) is must be shown that religion, race, sex caste or place of birth is the immediate ground and direct cause for the discrimination. 6. Section 494, I. P. C. in so far as it is relevant states ""Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the lifetime of such husband or wife, shall be punished."" On the face of the it Section 494 is not discriminatory since it makes no reference to the religion of either spouse. At this juncture itself we would like to remove the misconception that no Muslim can ever be punished under Section 494 and that no Hindu could be punished under Section 494 prior to the Hindu Marriage Act. A Muslim wife marrying during the subsistence of an earlier marriage can always be punished. So, too, we presume, a Muslim husband marrying a fifth wife during the subsistence of the four earlier marriages. That must follow since Section 9. I. P. C. prescribes that words importing the singular number include the plural number and therefore the word 'wife' in Section 494, I. P. C. must include wives. On that, however, we express no final opinion. Against a Muslim who marries under the Special Marriage Act is liable to punishment under Section 494 if he marries again during the subsistence of the first marriage (Section 44 of the Special Marriage Act). Similarly even prior to the Hindu Marriage act, a Hindu wife could always be punished for Bigamy. A Hindu, like any one else, who married under the Special Marriage, Act could also be punished for Bigamy.

The question which is referred to the Division Bench by Gatne J. is whether an order made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is appealable or can only be challenged in revision. The applicant in this revision application is the original plaintiff who has filed a petition in the Court of the Second Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur, under Section 12(1) (b) and (c) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, hereinafter referred to as the Act, asking inter alia for a declaration of nullity of his marriage with the opponent No.1. In the proceedings before the trial Court the opponent No.1, who is the wife of the petitioner, filed an application for grant of interim maintenance under Section 24 of the Act and claimed Rs. 200/- on account of monthly allowance, Rs. 2,000/- on account of Court expenses and Rs. 400/- on account of costs of defence, because, according to her, at the relevant time she was residing at Ahmednagar. This claim was contested by the petitioner-husband, but directed the petitioner to pay Rs. 100/- per month to the opponent No.1 from the date of the application for her maintenance and Rs. 300/- were directed to be paid in order to enable her to meet her Court expenses. 2. the petitioner-husband was aggrieved by this order and he, therefor, filed a revision application under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure in this Court. When the matter came before Gatne, J. for hearing he found that there was a conflict of views in 2 decisions of this Court on the question whether an order under Section 24 could be challenged by a revision application. In Prithvirajsinghji v. Bai Shivprabhakumari (AIR 1960 Bom 315) Gokhale, J. had taken the view that an order under Section 24 of the Act was not an appealable order and the same could be challenged only be a revision application. A contrary view was taken by Abhyankar, J. in Sakharam v. Parvati, (1965) Mah LJ Note No. 107) in which he held that an order under Section 24 was an appealable order. Abhyankar J. found support in the decision of the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Sarla Devi. v. Balwan Singh, and another decision of Full Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kode Kutumba v. Kode Seshratnamamba, . In view of the conflict in the two decisions of this Court this reference was made to a Division Bench. 3. We have heard Shri K. H. Deshpande, who appears on behalf of the petitioner-husband and according to him, on a proper construction of Section 28 of the Act that Section cannot be said to have provided for a right of appeal itself, but that the right of appeal must be governed by the provisions of Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is contended that only orders which are in the nature of decrees as defined in Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure could become the subject-matter of appeal and an order for interim maintenance made under Section 24 of the Act had no finality, and therefore, it did not partake of the nature of a decree and therefore could not be challenged by way of an appeal and the only remedy, according to him, open to a person who is aggrieved by an order under Section 24 of the Act was to challenge it by a revision application under 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On the other hand, it is contended by Shri Pradhan appearing forMadhukar Trimbakrao Ghisad vs Malti Madhukar Ghisad And Anr. on 25 July, 1972 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/611829/ 1the opponents that the only manner in which an order under Section 24 of the Act can be challenged is by filing an appeal because Section 28 of the Act gives a right of appeal though the forum and the procedure governing this right of appeal is to be decided with reference to the law which may be in force for the time being like the Bombay Civil Courts Act and the Code of Civil Procedure. In order to decide these contentions it is necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act. 4. The several provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, show that under this Act new rights and remedies have been created which were hitherto unknown to Hindu Law. Section 9 provides for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Section 10 provides for a decree for judicial separation of the grounds specified in that section. These two sections in terms make reference to decrees which may be passed. Section 12 also makes a reference to a decree of nullity. Section 13 makes a reference to a decree of divorce. Apart from the decrees which are contemplated by the above mentioned provisions of the Act there are certain provisions of the Act which empower the Court to pass certain orders as distinguished from decrees. Under Section 24 the Court is empowered to make an order directing the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings and to make monthly payments during the pendency of the proceedings having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent. Section 25 gives power to the Court to make an order either at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto requiring the respondent to pay to the applicant while the applicant remains unmarried some amount for her or his maintenance and support for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, and the income and other property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties. Under Section 26 the Court has jurisdiction to pass interim orders from time to time in the matter of custody, maintenance and education of minor children. Under this section the Court has the power to make a provision in the decree with respect to certain property which may belong jointly both to husband and wife. To other provisions which must be noticed are those contained in Sections 21 and 28 of the Act. Section 21 which provides that the proceedings under the Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is as follows : ""21. Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908."" Then there is Section 28 which is as follows : ""28. Enforcement of, and appeal from decree and orders. All decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the Court make in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. : Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of costs only.""Madhukar Trimbakrao Ghisad vs Malti Madhukar Ghisad And Anr. on 25 July, 1972 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/611829/ 2It is different construction which is placed on these provisions in the two decisions referred to above that the necessitated this reference. 5. While construing the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" Gokhale J. in AIR 1960 Bom 315 (cit supra) has taken the view that the question whether an appeal lies from an order passed by the Court under the Act must be determined by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the legislature having already provided in Section 21 that the Code of Civil Procedure was to govern all proceedings under the Act by referring to ""any law for the time being in force"" what the legislature intended was that the appealability of the decrees and orders should be determined by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and that Section 28 of the Act does not provide for an appeal against every order made by the Court in the proceedings under the Act, but appeal lies only against such orders as can fall within the definition of decrees under Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, or with regard to which an appeal is provided under the Code. He also held that the order passed by a Court granting interim maintenance under Section 24 of the Act will have to be distinguished from an order granting permanent alimony and maintenance which the Court can pass under Section 25 and that such an order cannot amount to a decree as defined in Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, would not be appealable as a decree. Abhyankar J. has not, whoever, given any reasons when he gave his decision in Sakharam's case, 1965 Mah :J (Note 107 (cit supra) and the only observations which are relevant in that order are as follows : ""The order is passed by the trial Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Under Section 28 of that Act all decrees and orders of the Court made in exercise of original civil jurisdiction may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. This is an order directing payment of interim maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and is one of the orders referred to in Section 28. In my opinion, therefore, this order could be challenged by an appeal to the same forum to which appeals normally lie from the decisions of the Court which passed this order. Instead of filing an appeal the applicant has filed a revision petition to this Court. Obviously, no revision is tenable against an order from which an appeal lies."" We do not, therefore, have the advantage of any reasoning in the judgment of Abhyankar J. 6. We have heard the counsel for the parties at considerable length and on a proper construction of provisions of Section 28 of the Act we are inclined to take the view that the right of appeal against a decree or an order made in a proceeding under the Act is given by the proceeding under the Act is given by the provisions of Section 28 itself. The first part of Section 28 relates to the enforcement of decrees and orders made by the Court in a proceeding under the Act. It provides that decrees and orders made by the Court in a proceeding under the Act are to be enforced in the same manner as the decrees and orders made by that Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced. The second part of Section 28 which reads as ""and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"" is the clause which has to be construed. There is some divergence of judicial opinion with regard to the construction of this clause. This clause has been construed by some High Courts to mean that this clause itself gives a right of appeal while the form for the appeal, the nature of the appellate jurisdiction and the powers to the appellate Court are to be determined with reference to the relevant law, while some High Courts have taken the view that Section 28 doesMadhukar Trimbakrao Ghisad vs Malti Madhukar Ghisad And Anr. on 25 July, 1972 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/611829/ 3","['26','10', '13', '24', '12', '21', '2', '9', '28', '11', '25']"

But for the two questions of law, though somewhat technical, raised by Mr. Suresh the learned Counsel for the respondent in this appeal, I was inclined to allow the appeal and to set aside the ex parte decree obtained by the respondent-husband against the appellant-wife in the circumstances which will be presently mentioned. But the two questions raised by Mr. Suresh are of grave importance though they relate to procedural law. Hence I am inclined to refer the said two questions for the consideration of the Division Bench. The questions arise in the context of the following facts: 2. The appellant before me was the respondent in the matrimonial petition filed by her husband (present respondent ) in the City Civil Court. For the sake of convenience the parties will be referred to with their position in the trial Court meaning thereby that the husband will be referred to as the petitioner, husband and to as the respondent-wife. The petitioner husband the respondent-wife were married in the year 1960. They got two daughters out of the marriage. The disputes between them started in October 1979. On 30-7-1980 the matrimonial petition for divorce was filed by petitioner-husband against the wife on the grounds of--- (a) desertion. (b) cruelty. It is noteworthy that the respondent-wife did not make any application for maintenance pendente lite in the said matrimonial proceedings nor has she applied for costs of the litigation; but she duly filed her written statement in the said proceedings on 10-2-1982. However, when the said petition came up for hearing on 1-12-1982, the respondent-wife was absent and hence an ex parte decree for divorce was passed in favour of the petitioner-husband against respondent-wife. The petitioner-husband waited for nearly two months thereafter. On 5-2-1983 he contracted a re-marriage with a second spouse who, it is alleged, resides at Banglore. The marriage also is alleged to have taken place at Banglore. 3. On 10-2-1983, the respondent wife took out a Notice of Motion for setting aside the ex parte decree. Evidently the application for setting aside the ex parte decree, if at all one could be filed, only could be filed within 30 days from 1-2-1982, assuming that the provisions of Article 123 of the Limitation Act applied; hence there was a manifest delay in filing the said application. However, there was even further delay; the Notice of Motion was served upon the petitioner- husband as late a son 17-9-1983.Prabhu Premlata Gurpur vs Prabhu Subraya Gurpur on 11 July, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1109895/ 14. On 28-10-1983, a second Notice of Motion was taken out by the respondent-wife for an injunction restraining the petitioner-husband from bringing his so-called second wife in the matrimonial house. On 29-10-1983, the injunction was granted by the trial Court as per the said Notice of Motion. 5. In reply to the said Notice of Motion for setting aside the ex parte decree three contentions were urged by the petitioner-husband viz.:--- (a) that the respondent wife had no sufficient cause for remaining absent on the date of hearing of the matrimonial petition; (b) that the delay in making the application for setting aside the ex parte decree was not justified by any sufficient cause of by any legitimate reasons; (c) that the petitioner-husband had already married a second wife after the period of limitation for setting aside the ex parte decree or for filing the appeal against the ex parte decree. It may be mentioned here that the application for a certified copy of the ex parte decree for divorce was made by respondent wife on 3-2-1983 that is to say clearly after the period of limitation for filing the appeal was over. The contention of the petitioner-husband, therefore, was that as per the right conferred upon him by section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act to contract a second marriage after the period of limitation for appeal was over he had married a second wife and hence ex parte decree could not be or should not be set aside. The trial Court was satisfied that the delay in filing of the application or setting aside the ex pare decree had not been duly explained by the respondent-wife. Hence the Notice of Motion was dismissed by the trial Court. 6. Since I am referring the appeal itself to the Division Bench, it is unnecessary for me to mention the reasons why I was initially inclined to allow the appeal; but I am indicating my own reasons in that behalf. The main ground upon which the Notice of Motion was dismissed by the trial Court was that the delay in making the application for setting aside the ex parte decree was not duly explained by respondent-wife. In particular it was held that though the allegation of negligence was made by respondent wife against her own learned Advocate, no affidavit was filed by the learned Advocate as such or on his behalf by his clerk as such. It appears that this Notice of Motion was argued by Mr. Navin Parikh. It was not he who was appearing for the respondent-wife at the time when the ex parte decree was passed and so far as ex parte decree was concerned, there was some explicable reason for the learned Advocate to remain absent. In the first place his office had caught fire and thereafter certain illness took place in his family for which he was required to go out of Bombay. He tried but was not successful in taking the requisite proceeding for setting aside the ex parte decree in due course from the place of his sojourn outside Bombay, by remote control as it were. Ultimately instructions had to be given by respondent wife to Shri Navin Parikh, Advocate to take out the Notice of Motion for setting aside the ex parte decree though after some delay. But further delay was caused by the office of Shri Navin Parikh, Advocate himself. It is true that Shri Navin Parikh himself argued the Notice of Motion on behalf of the respondent-wife. In fact he had even the affidavit sworn by his client, respondent-wife, herself in which it was stated that there was negligence on hisPrabhu Premlata Gurpur vs Prabhu Subraya Gurpur on 11 July, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1109895/ 2part in taking out these proceedings. However, no statement was made by Mr. Navin Parikh himself to the Court about the correctness or veracity of this position. There were also other persons at whose doorstep the blame was sought to be brought for the delay; but even their affidavits were to filed. In view of these short-comings, the trial Court was not satisfied about the respondent-wife's plea of heaving sufficient reasons for condonation of delay. 7. Before me the appeal was argued by Mr. Subnis the learned Counsel for the appellant. Mr. Navani Parikh did not appear before me; but when I expressed my surprise at the fact that neither any affidavit was filed nor any statement was made by Mr. Navin Parikh in support of the respondent-wife before the trial Court, Mr. Navin Parikh appeared personally before me and made a frank statement before the Court that the statement made by resplendent-wife in her affidavit in support of the Notice of Motion was a correct statement and that there did exist some negligence on the part of his office in the matter of taking out the Notice of Motion immediately. In this view of the matter, the main reason that the learned Judge was inclined not to accept the respondent-wife's plea for condonation of delay more or less disappeared. 8. But there was another reason why I was inclined to allow this appeal and send back the matter to the trial Court for hearing the suit on merits. A categorical statement was made before me by Mr. Subnis the learned Counsel for the respondent-wife that the second marriage set up by the petitioner was a hoax. He pointed out that the addresses of the alleged second wife, of her brother, of the priest who solemnised the marriage were mentioned by the petitioner-husband in the affidavit in reply in the lower Court; that the respondent-wife had sent letters to all these persons at the said Banglore addresses mentioned by the petitioner-husband; but all the letters had come back. It is sought to be argued before me by Mr. Tulsiani, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner-husband that the petitioner-husband's second wife and her brother had subsequently changed their addresses. But Mr. Sabnis pointed out that a attempt was made to contract these persons even at the alleged changed address and even on the alleged new address they were not to be found at all. Under these circumstances, I asked Mr. Suresh, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner-husband on 14-6-84, when this appeal was being heard, whether it would be possible for his client to keep his second wife, her brother and the priest, who performed the marriage, present in the Court. Mr. Suresh agreed and he even took time to do the needful in that behalf. Initially time for two weeks was taken. Thereafter that time was extended till 9th July, 1984. Still none of the persons was kept present in the Court. Not only this, but Mr. Suresh frankly stated to the Court that the petitioner-husband was not able to keep his second wife or her brother or even the priest who performed the marriage present in this Court at all. At one time I had even suggested that I would be inclined to issue summons to them if any application in that behalf was made; but no inclination was shown to accept this help from the Court. In these circumstances, there is every reason to hold that the arguments advanced by Mr. Sabnis that the plea of the second marriage was raised by the petitioner-husband only with a view to defeat the application for setting aside the ex-parte decree. Whatever that might be, in the peculiar circumstances of the case I was inclined to allow the appeal and to set aside the ex parte decree so that parties should have their dispute decided on merits by leading evidence at their disposal.Prabhu Premlata Gurpur vs Prabhu Subraya Gurpur on 11 July, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1109895/ 3",['7']
183,"Bombay High Court Jagdish vs Bhanumati on 25 February, 1983 Equivalent citations: AIR 1983 Bom 297 Bench: Puranik ORDER 1. The marriage between the applicant and non-applicant was solemnised at Nagpur according to Hindu rites in February 1960. After the marriage, the applicant and non-applicant were staying together at Jharsugda in district Sambalpur of Orissa State. The non-applicant wife, after some time returned to Nagpur to reside with her father. She filed a petition for judicial separation in June, Senior Division, Nagpur. It was registered as H M. P. No. 96 of 1970. However, she withdrew the same on 21-9-1970 by filing a pursis to that effect. 2. Subsequently, the husband present applicant, presented a petition for dissolution of marriage in the year 1975, at the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Sambalpur in Orissa State. It was registered as Title Suit No. 27 of 1975. Summons of the said suit was duly served upon the non-applicant wife, but the failed to appear and contest the same. On 30-3-77, the Subordinate Judge at Sambalpur passed an exempted parte decree of divorce as prayed for by the husband. 3. The non-applicant wife did not take any step for setting aside the said exparte decree, nor did she prefer any appeal against the same. It is thereafter, that on 20-6-78, the non-applicant wife presented an application under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act for grant of permanent alimony. This application Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur and came to be registered as Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 149/78. She also preferred application under Sections 24 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 151 of the Civil P. C. for interim maintenance for herself and her child. 4. All the above facts are not disputed. In the Miscellaneous Judicial Case, the applicant in the said proceedings, raised a preliminary objection about the jurisdiction of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur in the matter of entertaining the proceedings under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The main ground in the said preliminary objection was that the decree of divorce was passed by the Subordinate Judge at Sambalpur and it is that Court along which would have jurisdiction to entertain matters under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The applicant husband also filed an application praying that the question of jurisdiction an preliminary issue should be decided by the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur before proceeding with the case. 5. However, the Trial Court fixed the case for hearing the wife's application for interim maintenance and at the same time heard the counsel of both the parties on the question of preliminary issue. By its reasoning in paragraph 5 of the order, below Exempted. 5, the Trial Court came to the conclusion that under Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court at Nagpur also has jurisdiction to deal with the matters under Section 25 and it is not necessary that the proceedings under Section 25 ought necessarily to be filed at the Court where the decree in the matrimonial case was passed. He also proceeded to deal with the application for interim maintenance and directed the husband to pay an interim maintenance of Rupees 350 per month to the wife and her daughter and also to pay Rs.Jagdish vs Bhanumati on 25 February, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1546440/ 1300/- towards the costs of the proceedings. It is this order below Exempted. 5 passed by the Trial Court at Nagpur on 1-8-1980 which is impugned by the husband applicant by this revision. 6. Shri V. R. Manohar, Advocate appears for the applicant husband, while Shri M. G. Bhangde, Advocate represented the non-applicant. 7. The only question involved and which was urged on behalf of both the parties is regarding the forum where application under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to be presented. Shri Manohar for the applicant contended that Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act is applicable for deciding the jurisdiction of the Court only in respect of petitions for substantial reliefs under the Hindu Marriage Act, but the same would not be applicable to proceedings under Section 25. He pointed out that Section 25 itself qualifies the forum where application under that section is to be presented. It was his case that since the petitioner husband had filed the Hindu Marriage petition at Sambalpur in Orissa State, where a decree of divorce was passed, the wife-non-applicant, could have initiated permanent alimony proceedings only at the Court of Sambalpur and not at Nagpur. Shri Bhande, on the other hand submitted that Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is a general provision governing all proceedings under the Act including the one for permanent alimony under Section 25. 8. Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down that; Every petition under this Act shall be presented to the district Court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction:--- (i) the marriage was solemnized, or (ii) the respondent, at the time of the presentation of petition, resides or (iii) the parties to the marriage last resided together, or (iv) .....................(not relevant for the purpose of this petition). Accordingly, it may be argued that in facts and circumstances of the case, since the marriage was solemnised at Nagpur and since the parties to the marriage last resided together at Sambalpur, the matrimonial petition by one of the parties could be presented either at Nagpur or at Sambalpur. In the instant case, the wife had filed a petition for judicial separation at Nagpur in 1970, but had withdrawn the same. Later, the husband had presented the petition for dissolution of marriage under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are to be taken up for consideration and whether the permanent alimony proceedings are maintainable at Nagpur Court. 9. The plain reading of Section 19 clearly shows that it refers to every petition under this Act. The entire reading of the Hindu Marriage Act and the Scheme thereof shows that the reference to the word ""petition"" has been made from time to time only in respect of petitions for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9, or to petitions for judicial separation under Section 10, or petitionJagdish vs Bhanumati on 25 February, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1546440/ 2for void or voidable marriages under Sections 11 and 12, and for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce under Sections 13, 13A and 13B of the Act. Other sections are procedural sections and sections governing the conditions of Marriage. 10. Apart from this, it is only in Ss. 24, 25 and 26 of the Act which refer to the word ""application"". S. 24 refers to an application for interim maintenance pendente lite. S 25 refers to application for grant for permanent alimony and S. 26 refers to an application in respect of custody or maintenance or education of minor children during the pendency of a proceeding. 11. The substantive matrimonial reliefs under the scheme of the Hindu Marriage Act are governed by Sections 9 to 13B of the Act i.e. for restitution of conjugal rights, for judicial separation, for declaration of a void or voidable marriage, for divorce on one or the several contingencies or for divorce by mutual consent. All these substantive reliefs under the Hindu Marriage Act are to be secured by presenting a petition before the Court of original jurisdiction as defined under Section 19 of the Act. On the other hand, the applications which we have discussed above under Sections 24, 25 and 26, are to be presented during the pendency of the main substantive proceeding. The application for interim maintenance under Section 24 has to be presented during the pendency of the petition for substantial matrimonial relief. So also application for custody of the child or for maintenance or education, is to be presented when the substantive petition for matrimonial relief is pending. The wordings of the opening sentences of Sections 24 and 26 clearly show that the application are to be presented in in any proceeding under this Act. The wordings of Section 25 are however slightly different. Section 25 reads in so far as it is relevant of purposes of this revision, as follows; 25. (1) Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum ......................."" 12. Thus, the application under section 25 has to be presented to the Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act between the parties in respect of a substantial relief under the Act. The phraseology further shows that it is that Court which can pass an order either at the time of passing any decree for substantial relief or at any time subsequent thereto. It is further clear when the section says that such application has to be made to it i.e., referring to the Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto. 13. Even viewing the case from another angle, it would be seen that the proceedings under Section 24, 25 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act are consequential relief to the main or substantial relief arising out of the marriage petition. As far as Sections 24 and 26 are concerned, there can be no dispute that they are to be field during the pendency of the main proceedings for substantial relief. In so far as S. 25 is concerned permanent alimony is a consequential relief to the substantial relief of the determination of matrimonial rights between the parties. The phrase clearly shows that the Court exercising jurisdiction at the time of passing of the decree or subsequent thereto on an application presented before it may pass an order granting relief of permanent alimony andJagdish vs Bhanumati on 25 February, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1546440/ 3","['15', '10', '19', '24', '9', '25']"

The plaintiff/respondent filed the above-named title suit inter alia, praying for a declaration of her right to get maintenance as well as her right of residence in the property described in item No. 1 of the plaint schedule, being premises No. 95A, Tallygunge Circular Road, New Alipore, 24-Paraganas and also for arrear maintenance alleging inter alia, that she was the legally married wife of the defendant No. 1 Aappellant and their marriage was solemnised according to the Hindu rites and customs in or about 1967 and they lived together as husband and wife till November, 1977 and out of their wedlock, a child was born to them and thereafter she was driven away by the defendant No. 1 /appellant from her matrimonial home. 2. The defendant No. I/appellant in his written statement, however, categorically denied and disputed the allegations of the plaintiff that she was her lawfully married wife and that he had any obligation to maintain her and that the alleged marriage had taken place at all, but admitted that the plaintiff/respondent, who was a widow, became intimate with the appellant and a child was born out of the intimacy, but he never induced the plaintiff to marry him and no marriage was ever solemnised between them. In fact the defendant No. 1 and the added defendant Smt. Purnima Bhatta-chitryya were Indian Christians by birth and they were married according to the Christian rites on or about 3rd February, 1945 at St. Johns Church, Calcutta and the marriage was still subsisting. The added defendant/ respondent No. 2 Smt. Purnima Bhatta-charyya in her written statement, also denied and disputed the plaint case altogether and categorically stated inter alia that she and the defendant No. 1/appellant were Indian Christians by birth and a marriage solemnised between them on 3rd February, 1945 at St. Johns Church, Calcutta according to the Christian rites and customs and the said marriage is now still subsisting. 3. The plaintiff/ respondent No. 1 examined herself and also one Maniklal Chat-terjee as witnesses for the plaintiff being PWs Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. The plaintiff as PW 1 in her evidence stated inter alia, that the defendant/appellant was her husband and their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu Marriage Act in August, 1967 and she did not know that her husband was a Christian; that she lived with the defendant/ appellant as husband and wife for 7 (seven) years and achild was born out of the wedlock who was living with his father; that she was a maiden at the time of her marriage and she was not told that the defendant/ appellant was a married man, but subsequently, came to know of it. Shri Maniklal Chatterjee as PW 2 in his evidence stated inter alia, that he knew that the defendant had married the plaintiff and they lived together as husband and wife for about 7/8 years at 70A, Chetla Road, and during such living, the plaintiff gave birth to a male child; he also denied that the defendant/appellant was a Christian and he got such information from the defendant/ appellant's family.

He, however, admitted that he came to know the plaintiff/respondent for the first time during 1966-67 and he had ready access to her and a male child was born as a result of such intimacy and he was still residing with the defendant No, 1 / appellant, but the defendant No. I/appellant did not marry the plaintiff/ respondent at any point of time and that the plaintiff/respondent subsequently used to live with one Sambhu Ghosal. He also denied that he was the owner of premises No. 95A, Tallygunge, Circular Road or that he had landed properties at Sarsuna. The added defendant/respondent No. 2 as DW 2 in cross-examination denied that the plaintiff/ respondent No. 1 and the defendant/ appellant were married and also categorically stated that her (DW 2) marriage with the defendant/ appellant was still in force as he did not divorce her. 4. The learned Judge, however, observed inter alia, that though the defendant/ appellant had produced the Baptism Certificate being Exhibit B, the said certificate had been issued in June, 1988, that is, long after the institution of the suit in 1979, and as such, the Certificate of Baptism was given no exclusive or conclusive authority by law as instrument of evidence under S. 91 of the Indian Evidence Act and the entry of baptism thus would not exclude independent proof of the fact, and further held that the defendants had failed to establish that they were Christians by religion. The learned Judge further held that the defendant No. 1 had admitted his long and continuous cohabitation with the plaintiff as a result of which a son was born to them and so there was a strong presumption of marriage from habit and repute and mere absence of proof regarding marriage rites and ceremonies could not dislodge the presumption which could only be rebutted by proof of insurmountable obstacles to a valid marriage, and such presumption also found support from the admission of the defendant No. 1/ appellant that the plaintiff was his wife while she gave birth of a child at a Nursing Home, and his statement made in connection with Misc. Case No. 39 of 1977 wherein he had categorically stated that he mentioned the plaintiff/ respondent as his wife in the hospital document (Exhibit C), also lent support to the presumption of marriage and the evidence of PW2 was of much importance on the question whether the plaintiff/ respondent and the. defendant/appellant No. 1 were married and such evidence was very much admissible under S. SO of the Indian Evidence Act. So far as the marriage between the defendant No. 1 and the added defendant No. 2 was concerned, though the learned Judge had referred to the extracts from the Register Book of Marriage kept at the St. John's Church (Old Cathedral), Calcutta (Exhibit A), showing that the marriage between the defendant and the defendant No. 2 was solemnised on 3rd February, 1945 according to the Christian rites, the said evidence was discarded by the learned Judge holding that such a document having been issued only on 6th May, 1985 might be considered as certificate of marriage but it did not prove the marriage conclusively, and no independent witness had been examined to prove such marriage and no suggestion was put to PW 1 to ascertain whether Purnima was the wife of defendant No. 1, and ultimately held, that the defendant No. 1 had failed to prove that they were legally married husband and wife, and accordingly, the learned Judge passed the decree for maintenance at the rate of Rs. 500/- per month from the date of filing of the suit, inDr. Ranjit Kumar Bhattacharyya vs Smt. Sabita Bhattacharyya on 22 December, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1767470/ 2favour of the plaintiff/ respondent. 5. Mr. Bhattacharyya, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, however, places strong reliance upon Exhibit A the true copy of the extract from the Register Book of Marriages kept by the St. John's Church (Old Cathedral), Calcutta which was duly certified by the Senior Chaplain of the said Church and also upon the evidence of the defendant's witnesses, especially that of DW2 to prove that the defendant No. 1 and the defendant No. 2 were married in 1945 according to the Christian rites and that the said marriage was still subsisting. 6. Mr. Bhattacharyya further contends that since the marriage between the appellant and the respondent No. 1 was alleged to have taken place in 1967, i.e., after the passing of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and that too at a time, when the marriage between the appellant and the respondent No, 1 held in the year 1945 was still subsisting, the alleged marriage of the respondent No. I with the appellant in the year 1967 was a nullity as on the date of the alleged marriage the appellant had a wife living and as such, the respondent No. 1 was not entitled to get any maintenance from the appellant No, I, inasmuch as, S. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions, and Maintenance Act, 1956 speaks of maintenance to be claimed by a legally married wife and the said Act does not contain any provision entitling a woman to claim maintenance from a person with whom she had entered into a void marriage, and in support of his contention Mr. Bhattacharyya refers to the Bench decision of the Patna High Court in the case of Banshidhar Jha v. Chhabi Chatterjee, . References were also made to the decisions of the different High Courts namely, T.P. K. Natesan Chettiar v. Achiyayee Aminal, ; Kesarabai v. Haribhau, and Mutyala Satya-narayanamurthi v. Mutyala Jaggamma, AIR 1962 Andh Pra 439. 7. Mr. Nandi, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1, however, contends that since the certificate, Exhibit B, was not duly proved, no reliance could be placed on such Exhibit, and the learned trial Judge also had rightly discarded' such document in arriving at his finding, that the defendants had failed to prove that they were legally married husband and wife. Mr. Nandi further contends that in the facts and circumstances of the case as stated above, the presumption of marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 drawn by the learned trial Judge in favour of the plaintiff, could not be rebutted by the defendants at all, and as such, the judgment and decree of the trial court should not be interfered with and/or disturbed. 8. Mr. Nandi, also contends inter alia, that since the trial Court had observed that there was a presumption of marriage between the respondent No. 1 and the appellant, the respondent No. 1 is entitled to maintenance no matter whether such marriage was valid or not under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 inasmuch as, the words ""Hindu wife"" in S. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 cannot be interpreted to mean only a wife whose marriage is valid according to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as such an interpretation would render the provisions of S. 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 otiose. The words ""Hindu wife"" as contemplated by S. 18, according to Mr, Nandi, would mean a Hindu wife whose marriage is solemnised, though void under the Hindu Marriage Act, and in support of his contention refers to a single Bench Decision of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of C. Obula Konda Reddy v. C. Pedda Venkata Lakshamma, , and also to a single Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in theDr. Ranjit Kumar Bhattacharyya vs Smt.

These Appeals coming on for hearing on Thursday the 5th Wednesday the 11th and Thursday the 19th day of April, 1990 in the presence of the respective Advocates, and having stood over for consideration till this day, the court delivered the following Judgment: 2. These two appeals by the husband arose out of a common judgment passed by the VIII Additional Judge, City Civil Court, Madras, in A.S. No. 49 of 1981 and CM.A. No. 33 of 1981. 3. The brief facts which are necessary for the disposal of these appeals are as follows : The respondent-wife filed the suit in O.S. No. 9654 of 1977 before the V Assistant Judge for separate maintenance against the appellant. According to her, their marriage took place on 31-1-1975 at Madras and the consummation of the marriage took place on 1-2-1975. The appellant took her to his parents' house after 2 or 3 days in respondent's place. Thereafter he started teasing her alleging insufficiency of gifts by her parents and also the presence of a small congenital lump on the respondent's shoulder. Even though it was known to him even before marriage, he ignored it as inconsequential. On 13-2-1975 the respondent-wife was sent away from the house by the appellant-husband asking her to come back with larger presents and jewels. The parents of the respondent were unable to fulfil his desire. On 28-7-1975 the appellant issued a notice to the respondent alleging that she had left the house on her own accord, to which she sent a suitable reply on 2-8-1975 denying the allegations and stating she was deserted by the appellant and that she was anxious to join the appellant. The appellant issued a rejoinder. Thereupon, he filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights in O.P. No. 430 of 1975. The respondent in her counter submitted that she was willing and anxious to join the appellant by narrating the circumstances under which she was deserted by her husband. On 21-2-1977 the court allowed the petition and granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights on the basis of the averments made in the counter filed by the respondent. Thereafter on 8-3-1977 the respondent wife sent a notice through her Counsel to the appellant that she was willing, to join with the appellant and lead a conjugal life with the appellant and requested him to send some relation to take her back to his house. The appellant did not send any reply. Again, on 19-5-1977 she sent word to the appellant that she would be returning to him on 23-5-1977. The appellant sent a reply through the emissary that final orders have not been passed by court and that he would lock up the house and go away on 23-5-1977. The respondent who went to the house of the appellant on 23-5-1977, was not allowed to enter the house by the appellant and his mother. Thereupon she issued a notice on 28-5-1977 setting out the facts and the appellant's refusal to take her back. The respondent made two more attempts on 7-8-1977 and 28-9-1977 to join the appellant, but in vain. On 15-10-1977 she along with her parents went to the appellant's house, but she was not allowed to enter the house by the appellant. Thereupon the respondent gave a complaint at the Elephant Gate Police Station. At the police station the appellant gave in writing that he declined to take her back to his house. Hence, she claimed maintenance under Section 18 of theT. Srinivasan vs T. Varalakshmi on 25 April, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134445/ 1Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act at the rate of Rs. 300 and also past maintenance, as the appellant is employed as Upper Division Clerk in the Police Department drawing a salary of Rs. 500 p.m., and also getting income from the undivided joint family property of himself and his father. 4. The suit was resisted by the appellant and in the written statement he admitted the marriage and submitted that the respondent and her parents played a deception on him by not disclosing a large lump on the back of the respondent which was discovered by him only on the nupital night. He would further state that the respondent agreed to remove the lump by surgery and hence she went to her parents' house on 13-2-1975. He denied having illtreated the respondent on the inadequacy of gifts etc. He would state that all his attempts to get back his wife, the respondent, proved to be of no avail. Hence he filed O.P. No. 420 of 1975 for restitution and obtained a decree. But in spite of the decree, she did not care to join him. Hence, he filed O.P. No. 271/78 for divorce on the ground that she has not joined him for more than one year after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. He stated that he was not liable to pay any maintenance to the respondent. The respondent is running a nursery school and earning Rs. 500 per mensem. He would state that he was getting Rs. 375 as clerk in the police department. O.P. No. 271 of 1978 which is the subject matter of C.M.A. No. 33 of 1981 was filed by the appellant under Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, for a decree of divorce on the ground that though he obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights on 21-2-1977 in O.P. No. 420 of 1975, the parties have not lived together. According to him, since one year has lapsed from the date of the decree and that there has been no restitution between the parties, he is entitled to the said relief. The said application was resisted by the respondent who would state that it is only the appellant who deserted her without reasonable or probable cause and all attempts made by her to go and live with him after the decree for restitution have become futile and as such, he is not entitled to a decree for divorce. 5. The trial Judge after holding a joint trial, in a common judgment came to the conclusion that it is only the appellant who deserted the respondent without reasonable or probable cause and the respondent-wife is entitled to maintenance at the rate of 100 per mensem and also past maintenance at the above rate for 6 months. However, trial Court negatived the claim for a charge over the property as the property was not specified. The trial court also dismissed O.P. No. 271 of 1978 holding that it was only the appellant who had rejected the offer of the respondent to come and live with him and that there was a fault on the part of the respondent to give restitution of conjugal rights. Aggrieved by the same, A.S. No. 49 of 1981 and C.M.A. No. 33 of 1981 were filed and the appellant was unsuccessful. Hence these two second appeals. They were admitted on the following substantial questions of law : C.M.S.A. No. 39 of 1981 1. Whether the court below failed to apply the principle laid down in Section 13(1A) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1959 ? 2. Whether a decree for divorce should automatically follow on the expiry of the period of one year from the date of decree for restitution of conjugal rights ?T. Srinivasan vs T. Varalakshmi on 25 April, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134445/ 23. Whether the Court below is justified in refusing a decree for divorce for the appellant on the basis of Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 ? S.A. No. 2237 of 1981 1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to maintenance even after a right to seek divorce under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act has accrued to the appellant ? 2. Whether the respondent is entitled to separate maintenance ? 3. Whether the quantum claimed is correct ? 6. The learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. N.S. Varadachari, submitted that the other questions in S.A. 2237 of 1981 only follow the decision on the substantial questions of law, 1 to 3 in C.M.S.A. No. 39 of 1981, namely, whether the appellant is entitled to the decree of divorce under Section 13(1-A) of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. When once it is not found in favour of the appellant, then automatically he is liable to pay maintenance as claimed by the respondent, which is the subject matter of S.A. No. 2237 of 1981 and awarded by the courts below and it cannot be said that the quantum awarded is also in any way excessive and the respondentjs not entitled to any separate maintenance. Therefore, it is enough if substantial questions of law in C.M.S.A. No. 39 of 1981 are disposed of together at the first instance. Accordingly substantial questions of law 1 to 3 in C.M.S A. No. 39 of 1981 are taken up for consideration. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that though Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act is controlled by Section 23(1)(a), yet mere refusal on the part of the appellant to take back the respondent will not amount to wrong so as to disentitle him to get a decree for dissolution of marriage. According to the learned counsel even accepting the case of the respondent that after the decree she attempted to join the appellant but the appellant refused to take her back, that cannot be a ground for refusing to grant a decree of divorce since one year period has lapsed from the date of the decree and the refusal would not amount to ""wrong"" as contemplated in Section 23(1)(a). In support of his contention, he relies on the decisions in Dharmendra Kumar v. Usha Kumar, , Bimla Devi v. Sing Raj, , Madhukar Bhaskar Sheorey v. Smt. Saral Madhukar Sheorey, , Soundarammal v. Sundara Mahalinga Nadar, . On the other hand the learned counsel for the respondent drew the attention of this court to the finding of the courts below and submitted that those decisions are not at all helpful to the case of the appellant, as in the instant case the appellant filed the very petition for restitution of conjugal rights only to obtain a decree of divorce and with that view, even after the decree of restitution of conjugal rights was passed on his application when the respondent did not contest the same but expressed her readiness and willingness to join the appellant and in spite of many requests by means of notices through advocate and mediators and when the respondent herself went along with her parents, she was not allowed to join the appellant and in the circumstances, the appellant cannot take advantage of his own wrong and obtain a decree of divorce. In this connection, the learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to the findings of the trial court as well as the lower appellate court. It is seen that the findings of the trial Court in para 21 are : ""Though the defendant got a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, it is evident from the evidence let in that he has got this order only to see that he gets a further order of divorce.""

These two appeals are directed against the common Judgment passed by the Family Court, in two proceedings initiated before it under the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act, in respect of the custody of one Varun, a minor child. G. & W.C. No. 73/87 was filed by the grandparents of the said Varun to appoint them as guardians of their grand-child and G & W.C. No. 75/87 was filed by the father of the said Varun to get custody of his son. The first petition came to be dismissed and the second petition came to be allowed and therefore, the grand-parents who happen to be the petitioners in the first petition and respondents in the second petition have preferred these appeals. 2. The evidence has been recorded in the first petition G & W.C. No. 73/87 and in the lower Court the parties have been referred to by virtue of the ranks they had occupied in the 1st petition. For the sake of convenience we will also adopt the same course of reference to the parties, by virtue of their ranks occupied in G & W.C. No. 73/87 or by virtue of their relationship as occasion may demand. 3. Certain factual events leading up to the filing of the petitions are practically undisputed, though the parties are at variance in respect of the cause or reasons which led up to the said events. We would in the first instance refer to the undisputed events. Usha the daughter of the petitioners was married to the respondent on 15-7-79. Both the respondent and his wife Usha lived together at Calcutta where the respondent was working during the said time till 23-12-79, on which date she left her matrimonial home at Bangalore to reside with her parents. By that time she had become pregnant and on 7-7-80 she gave birth to Varun a male child. Both Usha and her husband respondent filed a joint petition for divorce by mutual consent in the Court of the City Civil Judge, Bombay, in M.J.P. 844/82. On 29-4-82 the Bombay City Civil Court passed the order. It reads : ""The Petitioner No. I Kongot Ravindran Unni and the Petitioner No. 2 Usha Ravindran Unni jointly pray for a decree of divorce dissolving their marriage solemnized on the Fifteenth day of July one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine at Guruvayurappan Temple, Asthika Samaj, Matunga, Bombay, according to the Hindu Vedict Rites and for an order that the custody of the minor child named Varun do remain with the Petitioner No. 2 and that the Petitioner No. 1 be permitted to see and visit the said minor child at the residence of the Petitioner No. 2 whenever the Petitioner No. 1 desires to do so after giving adequate notice of the date and time of his intended visit to the residence of the Petitioner No. 2 to see the child and for a declaration that the Petitioner No. 2 gives up her claim permanently for the maintenance and/or alimony for herself and for the said minor child Varun and for such other and further orders and directing as may be just equitable and necessary in the circumstances of the case and the Petition being this day called on for hearing and final disposal, the Petitioners appearing by Advocate and upon the Advocate for the Petitioners tendering the Affidavit of the Petitioner No. 1 Kongot Ravindran Unni, herein dated the Nineteenth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty two the affidavit of the Petitioner No. 2 UshaP.

(Underlining by us) As can be seen from the contents of the order there was a decree resolving the marriage between Usha and the respondent and further an order was passed giving custody of the child Varun to Usha with visiting rights to the respondent. Afterwards, the child was in the custody of Usha Till February 1984, when she died of cancer. Thereafter, the said Varun is in the custody of its grand-parents the petitioners. Usha during her life time created a trust for the benefit of her son Varun and she also left a Will appointing her parents as guardians of her son and the said Will came to be probated. Thereafter, the two petitions referred to already have been filed by the grand-parents as also the father, before the Family Court, Bangalore. 4. On behalf of the petitioners their learned advocate Mr. Rego advanced the following contentions : (1) It was contended that in view of the fact that the City Civil Court, Bombay at the time of dissolution of the marriage of Usha with the respondent had passed orders regarding custody of Varun u/S. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, if any party wants any further orders regarding custody of Varun, he has to approach only that Court under Section 26 and in that view of the matter, both the petitions filed before the Family Court, Bangalore were not maintainable and deserve to be dismissed. (2) That the petition filed by the respondent under Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, is not maintainable because even on the very undisputed facts, he did not have custody of the ward Varun at any time and therefore, there could be no question of the ward leaving or being removed from the custody of the guardian within the meaning of Section 25 of the said Act.P. Madhavan Nair And Others vs K. Ravindran Unni on 10 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1993739/ 2(3) That the petitioners have been appointed as the testamentary guardians of minor Varun by Usha to whose custody the child was given as per the orders passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, and therefore, there is no question of Varun being removed from the custody of the guardian within the meaning of the said Section 25. (4) That, right from the beginning, the respondent father had not evinced any kind of interest in the minor child and ever since the birth, the child has been living with its grandparents and it has also expressed its desire to continue with the grand-parents and irrespective of the rights of the parties, having regard to the paramount consideration of the welfare of the minor child, custody should be continued with the grand-parents. 5. The grand-parents had not raised any point relating to jurisdiction before the Family Court and even in the course of the memorandum of appeal, they had not put forward any such ground but nevertheless, as it is a pure question of law, they were permitted to raise an additional ground in that regard for the first time before this Court. 6. We will take up for consideration the point pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Family Court to entertain these petitions. Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, under which orders were passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, giving custody of minor Varun to Usha reads as hereunder : ""In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree upon aplication by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending, and the Court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made."" Under this provision, the City Civil Judge, Bombay, had the necessary jurisdiction to pass the order giving custody of Varun to its mother has not been disputed. A mere look at the section itself would indicate that even after decree, the very same Court before whom the proceeding has been initiated under this Act, is entitled to pass such orders with respect to the custody and maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree as if the proceedings culminating in the decree are still pending. Therefore, the City Civil Judge, Bombay, before whom the divorce proceedings were initiated by the consent petition of both Usha and her husband respondent could also pass appropriate orders regarding custody and other aspects pertaining to the minor even after the decree, as if the proceeding was stilt pending. Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act which refers to the overriding effect of this Act reads as hereunder : ""Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,-- (a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to anyP.

The relevant portion of the petition relating to Court fee and valuation is extracted below: ""Fixed Court fee of Rs. 100/- is paid for this petition as per the Schedule II, Article I of the Karnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1958, as amended upto date"". 2. After contest, the said petition was dismissed. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant filed an miscellaneous appeal on 9-10-2000 in the Court of the Principal District Judge, Belgaum. As the office raised an objection in regard to maintainability, the appeal was not numbered. The objection was that having regard to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Parashuram Rao Anantha Rao Pise v. Smt. Pratibha Parashuram Rao Pise, 1974(1) Kar. L.J. 265 (DB), the appeal ought to have been filed in the High Court. After hearing, the learned Principal District Judge, Belgaum, by an order dated 11-1-2001 held that the appeal was not maintainable before the District Court and directed the return of the appeal papers to the appellant for presentation before the High Court, relying on Section 19 of the Civil Courts Act, 1964. Instead of take return and representing the appeal, the appellant has filed this appeal against the order of the District Judge, under Order 43, Rule 1(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellant contends that having regard to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Mallappa v. Mallava, AIR 1960 Mys. 292 (DB), and Section 19 of the Civil Courts Act, an appeal against the order of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), passed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 would lie to the District Court and not to the High Court and the District Court committed an error in ordering return of the appeal. The appellant has also contended that the decision in PISE is no longer good law in view of amendment to Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 by Act 60 of 1968. 3. The learned Single Judge before whom the appeal came up for hearing, was of the view that Mallappa's case, laid down the correct law. However, as the subsequent decision of Parashuram Rao Anantha Rao Pise took a contrary view, the learned Single Judge, by order dated 8-1-2003, referred the matter to the Division Bench to resolve the conflict between Mallappa's case and Parashuram Rao Anantha Rao Pise's case. The question that therefore arises for consideration is whether an appeal from an order/decree of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, in a proceedings under Sections 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, lies to the High Court or the District Court. 4. To decide the said question, a brief reference to the relevant provision of law is necessary.Mahadev Jyoti Umrani vs Smt. Sumitra on 1 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18285/ 14.1 Section 19 of Hindu Marriage Act ('HM Act', for short), requires every petition under the Act to be presented to the District Court. The term 'District Court' is defined in Section 3(b) of the said Act, as follows.-- "" ""District Court"" means, in any area for which there is a City Civil Court, that Court, and in any other area the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, and includes any other Civil Court which may be specified by the State Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in this Act"". 4.2 Section 14 of the Karnataka Civil Courts Act, 1964 ('Civil Courts Act', for short), provides that the District Court shall be deemed to be the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction within the local limits of its jurisdiction. Section 16 provides that the jurisdiction of the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), shall extend to all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature. 4.3 The State Government, by Notification in LAW 36 LCL 71, dated 2-11-1971 issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, specified all Courts of the Civil Judges (now Courts of Civil Judges (Senior Division)) as having jurisdiction in respect of matters under the Hindu Marriage Act. In view of it, except where Family Courts are established under the Family Courts Act, all matrimonial cases under the Hindu Marriage Act are filed in the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division) and not the District Court. 4.4 Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with appeals. It provides that all decrees made by the Court in any proceedings under the said Act shall be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. 4.5 This takes us to Section 19 of the Civil Courts Act, which deals with appeals from the decrees and orders passed by a Civil Judge (Senior Division), in original suits and proceedings of a civil nature. It provides that where such appeals are allowed by law, the appeal shall lie: (a) to the District Court, when the amount or the value of the subject-matter of the original suit or proceedings is less than Rupees One lakh; and (b) to the High Court in other cases. 4.6 Section 20 of the Kamataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 ('Court Fees Act', for short), provides that Court fee payable under the said Act shall be determined or computed in accordance with the provisions of Chapters IV, VI, VIII and Schedules I and II. Section 50 provides that in a suit as to whose value for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of Courts, a specific provision is not otherwise made in that Act or in any other law, value for that purpose and value for the purposes of computing the fee payable under the Court Fees Act shall be the same, Sub-section (2) of Section 50 of the Court Fees Act provides that in a suit where Court fee is payable under that Act at a fixed rate, the value for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of Courts shall be the market value or where it is not possible to estimate it at money value, such amount the plaintiff shallMahadev Jyoti Umrani vs Smt. Sumitra on 1 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18285/ 2state in the plaint. 4.7 Article 1 of Schedule II to Court Fees Act provides that in a petition under Sections 9 to 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and Memorandum of Appeal under Section 28 of that Act, the Court fee payable will be Rs. 100/-. 5. The reliefs claimed in a proceeding under Sections 9 to 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, are not capable of pecuniary valuation, as they relate to restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, declaration of nullity of marriage, annulment of marriage, and divorce. In regard to such a proceeding, jurisdiction is fixed statutorily under Section 19 of the HM Act read with Section 3(b) of HM Act and Notification dated 2-11-1971. The jurisdiction is not determined with reference to any pecuniary value mentioned by the person who approaches the Court in his plaint/petition. Therefore, there is no need for a petitioner in a proceeding under Sections 9 to 13 of HM Act, to state tide value of the subject-matter of the relief claimed, for determining the jurisdiction of the Court. In other words, Section 50(2) of Court Fees Act is inapplicable in regard to a proceeding under Sections 9 to 13 of HM Act, even though the Court fee thereon is payable only at a fixed rate. 6. Suits/proceedings which are not capable of pecuniary valuation, are of two types: (a) Those where there is no requirement in law to value the relief for purposes of determining the jurisdiction. (Petitions under Sections 9 to 13 of Hindu Marriage Act fall under this category.) (b) Those where there is a statutory requirement to specify a pecuniary value, even where the relief is not capable of pecuniary valuation, so as to determine the Court fee payable and/or to determine the jurisdiction of the Court which can deal with the matter. (A suit for a bare injunction not involving question of title, suit for easements, suits for declaration (not involving claim for possession or injunction) fall under this category). In cases falling under first category, neither Court fee nor jurisdiction of Court depends upon any valuation by the plaintiff/petitioner; and there is no need to value the reliefs sought. Even if any pecuniary value is mentioned, it is irrelevant and can be ignored. When a relief is incapable of being valued and when there is no legal obligation on the part of the plaintiff/petitioner to value the relief sought, the question of 'value of subject-matter of the proceedings' being less than or more than Rupees One Lakh does not arise. Therefore, the effect of Section 19(2) of the Civil Courts Act, in regard to decrees and orders passed by a Civil Judge (Senior Division) in suits and proceedings of a civil nature are as follows.-- (i) Where the subject-matter of a suit/proceeding is capable of valuation, or where there is a requirement in law to specify a valuation (even where the relief is not capable of valuation) and the amount or value of the subject-matter is less than Rupees One Lakh, the appeal will lie to the District Court. (ii) In all other cases (including cases where the amount or value of the subject-matter is Rupees One lakh or more, or where the subject-matter is incapable of pecuniary valuation), the appeal willMahadev Jyoti Umrani vs Smt.

188,"Kerala High Court Vinaya Nair vs Corporation Of Cochin on 27 February, 2006 Equivalent citations: AIR 2006 Ker 275, 2006 (3) KLT 17 Author: K Radhakrishnan Bench: K Radhakrishnan, K Sankaran JUDGMENT K.S. Radhakrishnan, J. 1. This matter has been placed before us on a reference made by a learned single Judge having expressed doubt with regard to the correctness or otherwise of the learned single Judge's judgment in Ramesh Kumar v. Kannapuram Grama Panchayat 1997 (2) KLT 434 wherein the learned single Judge took the view that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956 would apply to a Hindu outside the territory of India only if he is a Hindu domiciled in the territory of India and that he should have permanent residence in India. 2. Petitioners herein are husband and wife who belong to Nair community. Their marriage was solemnized on 13-7-2005 at Vinayaka Kalyana Mandapam at Ernakulam in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. First petitioner husband is employed at Canada and second petitioner his wife is a native of Kannur District in Kerala. First petitioner's parental home is at Thodupuzha and parents own properties there. First petitioner was born while parents were at Canada. Consequently he acquired Canadian citizenship by birth and therefore he has a Canadian domicile by birth. First petitioner, a Hindu by birth and who professes Hindu Religion has married the second petitioner, a Hindu by religion. After marriage they submitted an application in Form No. 1 of the Kerala Hindu Marriage Registration Rules 1957 to Corporation of Cochin for registering their marriage. Corporation however, refused to register their marriage on the ground that the first petitioner is of Canadian domicile. Petitioners have therefore approached this Court seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondent to issue a marriage certificate under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 read with Hindu Marriage Registration Rules (Kerala) 1957. 3. The Registering Authority placed reliance on the judgment of a learned single Judge of this Court in 1997(2) KLT 434 (supra). Learned single Judge took the view that Hindu Marriage Act would apply to a Hindu outside the territory of India only if he is a Hindu domiciled in the territory of India. Learned single Judge also took the view that only those Hindus having permanent residence in India will be covered by the Hindu Marriage Act. Petitioner in that case belonged to Nair community and was a resident of Kerala. He was employed in a Company at Tokyo in Japan during 1989-96. He married a Japanese girl. Marriage was solemnized in Kerala on 27-7-1996 at Kannapuram Grama Panchayat in accordance with the customery rites prevalent in the Nair community. Petitioner's wife is a Buddhist. They claimed that their marriage was solemnized under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. They along with their newly born child wanted to go to Japan for employment. For the said purpose they wanted a marriage certificate. Local authority refused the certificate on the ground that petitioners wife is not a Hindu and therefore Hindu Marriage Act would not apply. Learned single Judge accepted the plea of the local authority and dismissed the Writ Petition.Vinaya Nair vs Corporation Of Cochin on 27 February, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/706719/ 14. Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is an act to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus. Section 5 of the Act lays down the conditions for the solemnization of a Hindu marriage. Ceremonies for a Hindu marriage are provided under Section 7 of the Act. Section 8 of the Act deals with registration of Hindu marriages. Petitioners have complied with all the conditions for a valid Hindu marriage under Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that they had undergone all the ceremonies as provided under Section 7 of the Act and that they have solemnized the marriage at Ernakulam a place to which Hindu Marriage Act applies. The sole reason for denying the marriage certificate by the local authority is that even though the first petitioner is a Hindu by birth he was born in Canada and has acquired Canadian citizenship by birth and has his domicile in Canada. Question is whether the local authority could deny registration of a marriage entered into between a Hindu, having Canadian domicile and a person who is having Indian domicile, if their marriage is solemnised following the conditions laid down in Sections 5 and 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act at a place where Hindu Marriage Act applies. Contention was raised, by local authority placing reliance on the judgment of the learned single Judge that unless and until the first petitioner is a Hindu domiciled in the territory of India to which Hindu Marriage Act applies no certificate of registration as provided under Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act could be issued. Certificate was refused not because the petitioners are not Hindus and not because their marriage was not solemnized at Ernakulam following the ceremonies of Hindu Marriage and following the conditions for a Hindu marriage but due to the sole reason that first petitioner is having Canadian domicile and not Indian. Question is whether such a stand of the local authority is legal or not. 5. The Hindu Marriage Act came into force on 18th May 1955 which has amended and codified the law relating to marriage among Hindus. Section 2 of the Act states that the Act applies to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments, which includes a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj. Act also applies to any person who is a Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion. Section 4 of the Act gives -overriding effect to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides that any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage having the force of law ceases to have effect with respect to all matters dealt with in the Act. The Act also supersedes any such law contained in any Central or State enactment and any other law in force immediately before it came into operation by enacting that all such laws shall cease to have effect in so far as they are inconsistent with any provisions contained in the Act. Section 1 of the Act deals with extent of its application. Act extends to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir and applies also to Hindus domiciled in the territories to which the Hindu Marriage Act extends who are outside the said territories. For easy reference we may extract Section 1 which reads as follows: 1. Short title and extent-- (1) This Act may be called the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. (2) It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and applies also to Hindus domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who are outside the said territories.Vinaya Nair vs Corporation Of Cochin on 27 February, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/706719/ 2Previously the words ""domiciled in India"" found a place in Sub-section (2) of Section (1) which was later changed and the words ""domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends"" was substituted making the Act applicable to all Hindus with such domicile who may for the time being be outside the said territories whether they be in Jammu Kashmir or outside India altogether. The Apex Court in Organo Chemical Industries Ltd. v. Union of India AIR 1979 SC 1803 held that a bare mechanical interpretation of the words and application of a legislative intent devoid of concept of purpose will reduce most of the remedial and beneficent legislation to futility. Legislature in our view would not envisage a situation where persons who are of Hindu religion, professes Hinduism, comes to a place where Hindu Marriage Act is applicable and solemnise their marriage, even then the marriage would not be treated as a valid marriage even if they satisfied all the conditions laid down in the Hindu Marriage Act and followed all the customs, on the mere ground that one of them has acquired domicile by birth outside India not. by choice, but due to accident. We have to interpret the provisions especially Sections 1 and 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act bearing in mind the above principle. The Calcutta High Court in Prem Singh v. Dulari Bai and Anr. had occasion to consider a similar issue. The Bench considered the scope of Sub-section (1) of Section.1as well as Sub-section (1) Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. That was a case where the husband submitted an application for restitution of conjugal rights against respondent wife. According to him he had married the respondent according to Hindu rites in February 1955 in India. After marriage they continued, to live as husband and wife and a daughter was born. Complaint of the petitioner was"" that respondent had failed to return to the matrimonial home which led the petitioner's filing of application for restitution of conjugal rights. Trial court noticed that the petitioner therein was a Nepali and he was not a domiciled Indian and therefore he could not have invoked the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Consequently it was held that his application under Section 9 for restitution of conjugal rights was not maintainable. While interpreting Sections 1(1) and 2(1) of Hindu Marriage Act the Court held that as regards the intra territorial operation of the Act it is clear that it applies to all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs irrespective of the question whether they are domiciled in India or not. Above mentioned decision of the Calcutta High Court was however distinguished by a Special Bench in Gour Gopal Roy v. Sipra Roy AIR 1978 Cal. 163 expressing the view that it is not enough for the applicability of the Act if one of the parties is of Indian domicile. A learned single Judge of the Gujarat High Court in Nitaben v. Dhirendra Chandrakant Shukla and Anr. I (1984) D.M.C. 252 disagreed with the views expressed by the Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Gour Gopal Roy's case and quoted with approval the Division Bench judgment in Prem Singh's case. Learned single Judge of the Gujarat High Court, in our view has extensively considered the scope of Sections 1(1) and 2(1) of Hindu Marriage Act and took the view, the idea of domicile can never be imported into the marriage of two Hindus married in India according to Hindu rites. Court held that non applicability of the Act would be in an extreme case where both the spouses did not remain in India, both the spouses have domiciled outside India and both married outside India. Reference may also be made to a judgment of the Karnataka High Court in Vatsala v. Sub Registrar & Marriage Officer and Anr. 1991(1) Kar. L.J.294. That was a case where a foreigner got married in India with a girl of Indian nationality under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. The point that came up for consideration in that case was whether the marriage can be solemnized of an Indian citizen with a foreign national in India under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954.

This appeal by the appellant/wife is directed against the judgment and decree dated 30.7.2002 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Patiala vide which petition filed by the respondent/husband under sections 11 and 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (for short the Act), was allowed.Rajinder Kaur vs Kuldeep Singh on 31 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164255/ 1The respondent/husband filed a petition under sections 11 and 12 of the Act against the appellant/ wife on the allegations that the marriage between the parties was solemnized on 5.12.1997 at Ropar. Prior to the marriage the respondent/ husband was married to one Surjit Kaur and a female child namely Jaswinder Kaur was born on 15.8.1993. Surjit Kaur died on 10.5.1995 and thereafter the marriage between the parties was performed. The case set up by the respondent was that after the marriage the husband came to know that the appellant was already married with Jaspal Singh son of Hardial Singh resident of House No.75-A, Ward No.1, Jhugian Road, Kharar. Jaspal Singh was still alive and the marriage between the appellant and Jaspal Singh had not been dissolved. It was also the case set up that on inquiries family members of the appellant including the appellant disclosed that the marriage between the appellant and Jaspal Singh was dissolved by a decree of divorce but the copy thereof was retained by their counsel. However, no copy was shown to the respondent. It was also the case of the respondent that even sub-caste of the appellant was not disclosed which was, in fact, the same as that of the respondent. Thus, plea of fraud was taken for declaring the marriage to be nullity. Petition was contested on the plea that the respondent/husband has supressed the material facts regarding birth of a female child on 5.2.1999 in Kiran Nursing Home, Ropar. Smt.Surjit Kaur earlier wife of the respondent had died as a result of dowry death. FIR No.115 dated 5.5.1995 was registered at Police Station Sadar Patiala against the respondent and his father. It was alleged that the marriage between the parties was arranged through Ms.Kamaljit Kaur wife of Mohan Singh and not by Daljit Singh. It was disclosed that sub-caste was correctly disclosed at the time of marriage. It was pleaded that sub castes of the parties were different. It was also pleaded that the fact regarding previous marriage was disclosed to the respondent. Stand was taken that the marriage with Jaspal Singh was dissolved through writing in the panchayat which was written on stamp paper and signed by both the parties. Stand was also taken that the marriage between the partes was solemnized after dissolution of earlier marriage of the appellant with Jaspal Singh in the panchayat, and that Jaspal Singh had also solemnized second marriage with Baljinder Kaur daughter of Jagir Singh on 30.6.1998. It was denied that the certified copy of the decree was ever asked from the appellant. In the replication, averments made in the written statement were denied and that of the petition were reiterated. On the pleadings of the parties learned trial court framed the following issues:- 1. Whether the petitioner is entitled to annulment of his marriage with respondent Rajinder Kaur within the provisions of sections 11 nand 12 of the Hindu Marriage act? OPA 2. Relief. The respondent to prove the sub-castes of the parties proved on record pe-degree tables Ex.P.1 and P.2 . The respondent appeared in the witness box and also examined Smt.Parkash Kaur, Sucha Singh and Dalbir Singh, to prove the castes of the parties.Rajinder Kaur vs Kuldeep Singh on 31 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164255/ 2Learned matrimonial court held that sub-caste of both the parties was the same. However, plea of the respondent that fraud was played as the sub caste was not disclosed was not accepted. It was held that the fact was in fact disclosed to the respondent. On appreciation of evidence and fact regarding prosecution of the respondent regarding death of Surjit Kaur was taken to hold that the respondent must have been informed about the sub caste and the plea of fraud was rejected. It was also held that the parties were not within the digree of prohibited relationship as defined under section 3 (g) of the Act and therefore, it could not be a ground to annul the marriage. Learned matrimonial court, however, held that the marriage is void under section 11 of the Act, as on the date of marriage Jaspal Singh i.e. spouse of the appellant was alive. The learned matrimonial court held that plea that the marriage was dissolved in panchayat could not be accepted as no plea of custom was raised nor any such custom was proved. The learned matrimonial court held that on the date of marriage the appellant had not obtained divorce from her previous husband from any competent court having jurisdiction. As already observed above learned matrimonial court also found as a fact, that no evidence was led to establish that there was any custom or usage prevalent in the community of the appellant under which divorce through writing of panchayatnama was permissible. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M.M.Malhotra Vs. Union of India and others AIR 2006 SC 80, has laid down as under:- ""11. For appreciating the status of a , Hindu woman marrying a Hindu male with a living spouse some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (herein referred to as the ""Marriage Act"") have to be examined. Section 11 of the Marriage Act declares such a marriage as null and void in the following terms:: 11. ""Void marriage-- Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5."" Clause (i) of Section 5 lays down, for a lawful marriage, the necessary condition that neither party should have a spouse living at the time of the marriage. A marriage in contravention of this condition, therefore, is null and void. By reason of the overriding effect of the Marriage Act as mentioned in section 4, no aid can be taken of the earlier Hindu law or any custom or usage as a part of that law inconsistent with any provision of the Act. So far as Section 12 is concerned, it is confined to other categories of marriages and is not applicable to one solemnized in violation of Section 5 (i) of the Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 puts further restrictions on such a right. The cases covered by this section are not void ab initio, and unless all the conditions mentioned therein are fulfilled and the aggrieved party exercises the right to avoid it,Rajinder Kaur vs Kuldeep Singh on 31 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164255/ 3","['5', '11', '12']"
190,"Madras High Court Athiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A. Mohan And 3 Ors. on 22 December, 1994 Equivalent citations: II (1995) DMC 340 Author: A Lakshmanan Bench: A Hadi, A Lakshmanan JUDGMENT A.R. Lakshmanan, J. 1. Defendants 1 and 4 are the appellants in this appeal. The 1st respondent is the plaintiff and respondents 2 to 4 are defendants 2, 3 and 5. Respondents 2 to 4 viz., defendants 2, 3 and 5 were given up since they remained ex parte. 2. The 1st respondent/plaintiff filed the suit for partition of the suit properties, which are admittedly joint family properties having been allotted to the share of his father (1st defendant) in a partition between him, his brother and their father. The plaintiff's case is as follows:-- The plaintiff is the undivided son of the 1st defendant. His mother Rajammal/3rd defendant was married to the 1st defendant about 25 years prior to the suit according to the custom obtaining in the community to which they belong. Two sons were born to the 1st defendant through the 3rd defendant. The plaintiff is one of the sons. The other son, who was elder to the plaintiff, died a few months after his birth. 3. The 1st defendant married a second wife. The plaintiff's mother 3rd defendant preferred a complaint against the 1st defendant under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code in C.C. No. 34 of 1960 on the file of the Additional First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, and at the intervention of some mediators, the parties compounded the offence. 4. The 1st defendant obtained from the plaintiff's maternal grand-father/ 2nd defendant, who purported to act as the guardian for the plaintiff, a document alleged to be a release deed releasing the share of the plaintiff in the joint family properties for a stated consideration of Rs. 2,500/-. The said document was executed on 31.7.1960 and marked as Ex. A-1 . According to the plaintiff, Ex.A-1 is void and inoperative in law. The 2nd defendant, grand-father of the plaintiff, was neither a de facto nor dejure guardian of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was, at that time, under the care and protection of his mother, the 3rd defendant. In law, the father is the natural guardian and next to him, the mother is the natural guardian, and when both the father and the mother of the plaintiff are alive, the 2nd defendant, who is the maternal grand-father of the plaintiff, had no right to act as the guardian on behalf of the plaintiff and execute any document on his behalf. Further, there was absolutely no necessity to release the plaintiff's share in the joint family properties much less for a grossly inadequate consideration of Rs. 2,500/-. 5. The plaintiff would submit that under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, even the natural guardian cannot dispose of the minor's property without the previous sanction of the Court. Ex. A-1 executed by the 2nd defendant Subbaraya Gounder, maternal grand-father of the plaintiff, dealing with the plaintiff's share in the joint family properties, is absolutely void under the provisions of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act. Ex. A-1 release deed is void in law and has no legal effect and is non est. The plaintiff must, therefore, be deemed to be continuing to be a joint family member and must be deemed to be in joint constructive possession of the suit properties,Athiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A. Mohan And 3 Ors. on 22 December, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/892722/ 1which are joint family properties. In the absence of a release deed, the properties continued to be joint family properties. In the absence of a release deed, the properties continued to be joint family properties of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, and the plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to a half share in the properties. 6. The plaintiff issued a notice to the 1st defendant on 6.2.1975 demanding partition and separate possession of his half share in the suit properties. A reply dated 18.2.1975 was sent by the 1st defendant containing false and untenable allegations. 7. The defendant Athiappa Gounder filed a petition in I.A. No. 732 of 1979 to implead defendants 2 and 3 as parties to the suit and the said petition was allowed. Defendants 4 and 5, who are the sons of the 1st defendant through one Valliammal, were added as per orders in LA. No. 105 of 1987 dated 11.3.1987. According to the plaintiff, defendants 2 to 5 are unnecessary parties and they have been added only at the instance of the 1st defendant. 8. The 1st defendant claims that he has married a second wife and through her he has two sons viz., defendants 4 and 5. The plaintiff's mother/3rd defendant gave a complaint of bigamy against the 1st defendant before the Addl. First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, and in that case, the 1st defendant denied having contracted a second marriage. In these circumstances, there could not have been any valid marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5 and so, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim to be the legitimate children of the 1st defendant through any valid marriage. Therefore, they are not entitled to any share in the suit properties. Even if there was any marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5, it is not valid in law since the marriage between defendants 1 and 3 was subsisting. Even otherwise, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim any share in the suit properties as per Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act. As per Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, defendants 4 and 5 at best can claim a share in the separate properties of the 1st defendant and not in the joint family properties. So, in any view of the matter, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim any right or share in the suit properties. Therefore, the plaintiff has filed the suit for division of the suit properties into two equal shares and for putting him in possession of the share so allotted to him, and for other reliefs. 9. The 1st defendant, the father of the plaintiff, filed a written statement. The allegations which are necessary for the disposal of the present appeal alone are extracted here. It is true that the plaintiff's mother the 3rd defendant was married to the 1st defendant about 25 years prior to the suit. But, the said marriage was dissolved in O.P. No. 47 of 1960 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Salem. The plaintiff is the only son of the 1st defendant. The Panchayat regarding C.C. No. 34 of 1960 on the file of the Additional First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, is true. The execution of the release deed on 31.7.1960 for Rs. 2,500/- is true. The release deed is valid and binding on the plaintiff and the plaintiff cannot now attack the validity of the same after his completing the 25th years. It is only the plaintiff's mother who made her father the guardian for the plaintiff and executed the release deed. The plaintiff's suit without a prayer to set aside the release deed is bad. The plaintiff cannot claim a share after 17 years. The 1st defendant's possession of the suit properties all these years as his own openly and to the exclusion of others debars the plaintiff from claiming any share.Athiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A. Mohan And 3 Ors. on 22 December, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/892722/ 210. The 4th defendant filed a separate written statement contending that since the plaintiff has executed a release deed, he is not entitled to any share in the suit properties. The plaintiff's mother wanted her father to be the guardian for the plaintiff. So, the plaintiff's maternal grandfather Subbaraya Gounder, as, guardian of the plaintiff, has executed the release deed after obtaining a sum of Rs. 2,500/-. The plaintiff's claim for a half share in the suit properties without seeking to set aside the release deed is null and void. Defendants 1, 4 and 5 have been enjoying the suit properties and are in possession of the same openly all these years. Defendants 4 and 5 are the sons of the 1st defendant through his second wife. There was a valid marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5. Therefore, defendants 4 and 5 are entitled to 1/3rd share each along with the 1st defendant. The suit is barred by limitation as the plaintiff has not moved the Court to set aside the release deed within three years after attaining majority. 11. On the basis of the above pleadings, the Trial Court framed five issues. The plaintiff has examined himself as P.W. 1 and marked Exs. A-1 to A-3. On the side of the defendants, the 1st defendant examined himself as D.W. 1 and two other witnesses were examined on their side besides marking Exs. B-1 to B-3. The learned Subordinate Judge, on a consideration of the entire evidence, has held that Ex. A-1 having been executed by the 2nd defendant, who was not the plaintiff's de jure guardian, was void as per Section 11 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, that there was no need to have it set aside, that despite Ex. A-1, the plaintiff continued to be a member of the joint family and was entitled to a half share since it has not been established that the 1st defendant has married one Valliammal after his marriage with the 3rd defendant was dissolved by a decree of divorce, and that defendants 4 and 5 will not be entitled to any share in the suit property. Consequently, the Trial Court decreed the suit as prayed for, against which the present appeal has been filed by defendants 1 and 4. 12. We have heard the elaborate arguments of Mr. S. Rajasekar for the appellants/defendants 1 and 4 and Mr. S.P. Subramaniam for the 1st respondent/plaintiff. Learned Counsel for the appellant reiterated the grounds raised in the memorandum of appeal. He invited our attention to the decisions reported in Kasturi Lakshmibayamma v. Sabnivis Venkoba Rao ; Shanthi Parshad v. Kunj Lal (A.I.R. 1953 Pepsu 151); Mayilswami Chettiar v. Kaliammal [1969(I) M.L.J. 177 = (1968) 81 L.W. 406]; Muppudathi Pillai v. Krishnaswami [1959 (II) MLJ, 225 = 72 L.W. 543 (F.B.)]; and V. Muthukumara Chetty v. Anthony (AIR 1915 Madras 296). Mr. S.P. Subramaniam, learned Counsel for the 1st respondent addressed arguments supporting the judgment of the Court below. 13. We have already seen that the plaintiff's claim is sought to be denied on the ground that he had executed the release deed Ex. A-1 dated 31.7.1960 giving up his share in the joint family properties for a consideration of Rs. 2,500/-. The plaintiff's case is, that the release deed Ex. A-1 is void ab initio. Ex. A-1 (at page 21 of the typed set) has been executed by the 2nd defendant, the maternal grandfather of the plaintiff, in favour of the 1st defendants' father and elder brother. The 2nd defendant was neither de jure nor de facto guardian of the plaintiff at the relevant point of time. 14. Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act provides that the father and after him the mother are the natural guardians. This section runs as follows:Athiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A.

Agrawal Construction Co., 2004(II) MPJR SN 55 taking the view that in the absence of provision in Act of 1983 delay can not be condoned under Section 5 of Limitation Act has been referred for consideration of Larger Bench on 7-5-2004 in the light of decision rendered by the Apex Court in Mukri Gopalan v. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker, (1995) 5 SCC 5 = AIR 1995 SC 2272. In C.R. No. 633/2003, C.R. No. 1000/2003 and C.R. No. 151/2004, similar question has been referred. After the reference was made, Special Leave Petition arising out of Division Bench decision in the matter of Nagar Palika Parishad, Morena (supra) has been dismissed by the Apex Court as per Order dated 27-8-2004. Thereafter esteemed brother Dipak Misra, J., in C.R. No. 1119/2003 has referred two questions for consideration by Larger Bench which includes the question whether decision of Apex Court of dismissal of SLP is a binding precedent. The two questions referred for consideration are quoted below :-- ""(a) Whether the power of High Court for exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 19 of M.P. Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 is totally constricted and restricted to a period of three months of the passing of the award which is the limitation prescribed for an aggrieved party or it can exercise such power of revision suo motu within a reasonable period of time that can travel beyond three months ? (b) Whether the decision rendered in the case of Nagarpalika Parishad v. Agrawal Construction Co., 2004(2) MPJR 374 would be a binding precedent ?"" 2. Facts giving rise to the revisions need not be elaborated as only question for consideration is whether delay can be condoned in filing revision in exercise of power under Section 5 of Limitation Act as the revisions have been preferred beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 19 of the Act of 1983 which prescribes the limitation for filing revision to be three months from the date of the award by an aggrieved party. Sub-section (1) of Section 19 empowers the High Court to exercise power of revision suo motu at any time or on an application by aggrieved party to be filed within three months. 3. Shri M.L. Jaiswal, Sr. Advocate, Shri V.R. Rao, Shri Sanjay K. Yadav and Shri Mohd. Nasir, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners have submitted that provision of Limitation Act, 1963 have not been expressly or by implication excluded by the Act of 1983; and that, thus, by virtueM.P. State Electricity Board vs Pandey Construction Co. on 13 April, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733438/ 1of Section 29(2) of Limitation Act, provision of Sections 4 to 24 shall apply, and consequently Section 5 of Limitation Act is also applicable. They have also placed reliance on the scheme of Act of 1983 to contend that, it nowhere excludes the applicability of the Limitation Act, as a different period of limitation has been prescribed than prescribed by the schedule, hence by virtue of Section 3 of Limitation Act, revision filed is subject to Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) of Limitation Act. Revision is provided under Section 19 of Act of 1983 to the High Court which is a Court as such provision of Limitation Act applies. There is no exclusion by special or local law, that is by the Act of 1983. Decision in Nasiruddin and Ors. v. Sitaram and Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 577, is distinguishable as that is in the context of condonation of default in depositing the rent under the concerned Rent Control Act where power to condone the delay was expressly excluded. It has also been submitted that decision in Mukri Gopalan 's case (supra) is attracted where the Apex Court has held that District Court while hearing the appeal of eviction under Kerala Rent Control Act has the power to condone the delay in filing an appeal filed after expiry of period of limitation prescribed under the Kerala Rent Control Act. It is further submitted that conditions for applicability of Section 29(2) stands satisfied hence this Court should prefer the dictum of Mukri Gopalan 's case (supra) instead of Nasiruddin's case (supra). It is contended that the decision in Nagar Palika Parishad, Morena (supra) rendered by the Apex Court, by dismissal of SLP can not be said to be binding precedent as the scheme of the Act of 1983 has not been considered by Division Bench of this Court while rendering decision or by the Apex Court while dismissing the SLP. It is also submitted that order passed by Supreme Court in Nagar Palika Parishad, Morena (supra) is rendered sub silentio, hence dismissal of SLP can not be said to be binding precedent under Article 141 of the Constitution of India. There is no merger of the order. In absence of merger, it can not be said that dismissal of SLP in Nagar Palika Parishad, Morena constitute binding precedent. 4. Learned Counsel for petitioners have also submitted that even if delay in filing revision by an aggrieved party can not be condoned, that does not preclude the High Court to exercise the suo motu power of revision in appropriate cases; and that as the suo motu power is not restricted by the period of limitation of three months, this Court can exercise the power at any time as provided in Section 19 (1) of the Act of 1983. 5. Shri V.R. Rao, learned Counsel appearing in C.R. No. 1119/2003 on behalf of respondent conceded that even if revision is not preferred within limitation, it is open to this Court to exercise the power of suo motu revision in appropriate cases within reasonable time. 6. Shri K.C. Ghildiyal, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of respondent in C.R. No. 633/2003 has submitted that Section 19 of the Act of 1983 expressly or by necessary implication exclude the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act and, therefore, this Court can not condone the delay. 7. First coming to the Scheme of the Act of 1983, Section 3 provides for Constitution of Arbitration Tribunal for resolving all such disputes or differences pertaining to works contract involving a sum of Rs. 50,000/- or more. Reference to Tribunal is provided under Section 7. Either party to a works contract may refer a dispute in writing to the Tribunal. Section 7-A provides every reference petition shall include whole of the claim. Section 7-B contains the limitation for filing a reference. It is provided that a Tribunal shall not admit a reference petition unless the dispute is first referred forM.P.

Sub-section (2-A) of Section 7-B provides that the Tribunal shall not admit a reference petition unless it is made within three years from the date on which the dispute arises.

Section 16 deals with passing of award, Section 17 provides finality to the award. Section 17-A deals with inherent powers of the Tribunal to make such an order as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Tribunal. Section 18 provides that award to have force of decree of District Court. Section 20 creates a bar on jurisdiction of Civil Court. Section 22 makes Chairman, Members etc. to be public servants. Action taken in good faith is protected under Section 23. Tribunal in relation to any reference or legal proceeding before it shall be deemed to be Civil Court as per Sub-section (1) of Section 24 and any reference or legal proceeding before it shall be deemed to be judicial proceeding. Tribunal shall have such jurisdiction and may exercise such of powers under Sections 340, 342, 344, 345, 346, 348, 349 and 350 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as provided by Sub-section (2) of Section 24 of Act of 1983. 8. We consider it proper to refer to various decisions referred to at Bar. The Apex Court in Hukumdev Narain Yadav v. Lalit Narain Mishra, AIR 1974 SC 480, has laid down that in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the Court to examine whether, to what extent the nature of the provisions of the special law or the nature of the subject-matter and scheme of the special law exclude the operation of Limitation Act. What the Court has to see is whether the scheme of the special law and the nature of the remedy provided therein are such that the Legislature intended it to be a complete code. If on an examination of the relevant provisions it is clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act are necessarily excluded, then the benefits conferred therein can not be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Special Act. Their Lordships held that provision of Section 86 of Representation of People Act gives a peremptory command that High Court to dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of Section 81, 82 or 117. If for non-compliance with the provisions of Sections 82 and 117 which are mandatory, the election petition has to be dismissed under Section 86(1) the presentation of election petition within the period prescribed in Section 81 would be equally mandatory, the non-compliance with which visits the penalty of the petition being dismissed. 9. In Sakuru v. Tanaji, AIR 1985 SC 1279, it has been held that Limitation Act, 1963 apply only to proceedings in ""Courts"" and not to appeals or applications before bodies other than Courts such as quasi-judicial Tribunals or executive authorities, notwithstanding the fact that such bodies or authorities may be vested with certain specified powers conferred on Courts tinder the Codes of Civil or Criminal Procedure. But even in such a situation the relevant special statute may contain an express provision conferring on the Appellate Authority the power to extend the prescribed period of limitation on sufficient cause being shown by laying down that the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act shall be applicable to such proceedings.M.P.

192,"Gauhati High Court Anupam Das vs Smt. Mampi Das on 4 October, 2007 Equivalent citations: AIR 2008 Gau 3, 2007 (4) GLT 543 Author: T Vaiphei Bench: T Vaiphei ORDER T. Vaiphei, J. 1. This revision petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is directed against a common interlocutory order dated 8-12-2006 purportedly passed under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and under Section 20(3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, by the learned District Judge, Shillong in Misc. (Main) Petition. Nos. 13(H) and 14(H) of 2006 directing the revision-petitioner to pay Rs. 1,000/- per month to the respondent and another sum of Rs. 500/- per month to her minor child for their respective maintenance. 2. The relevant facts giving rise to this revision petition are not in dispute. The petitioner was married to the respondent on 26-8-2002 in. accordance with the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and the same was duly registered with the Office of the Registrar of Marriage, East Khasi Hills District, Megbalaya. The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was again solemnized on 3-10-2002 at Kamakhya Temple at Guwahati according to Hindu rites. From this marriage, a male child, namely, Master Hritik Das, who is now aged about 4 years, was born to them on 1-9-2003. The minor boy is in the custody of the respondent. Subsequently, marital disputes apparently arose between the spouses. Alleging that she has been subjected to mental and physical cruelty, the respondent filed a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 before the learned District Judge, Shillong for dissolving her marriage with the petitioner by a decree of divorce. The divorce petition was registered as Divorce Case No. 4(H) of 2006. The respondent side by side filed two miscellaneous applications for herself and on behalf of her minor-son purportedly under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for permanent alimony and under Section 20(3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 for maintenance, which were registered as Misc. (Maint) Petition No. 13(H) 2006 and Misc. (Maint) Petition No. 15(H) of 2006. It was on the basis of the aforesaid applications that the impugned order of maintenance was passed. 3. Assailing the impugned order, Ms. A Paul, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, contends that the learned District Judge grossly erred in law, and acted without jurisdiction in granting maintenance allowance to the respondent under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act when this provision is solely concerned with permanent alimony and not interim maintenance allowance. She further submits that the learned District Judge has completely overlooked the glaring legal position that permanent alimony could be granted only after/at the time of passing of a decree for annulment of marriage. It is also the contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that when the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent had been solemnized and duly registered with the Registrar of Marriage under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the learned District Judge has no inherent jurisdiction to entertain and proceed with the divorce petition filed by the respondent under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act; such proceedings and the impugned order passed in connection therewith are, therefore, null and void. In support of herAnupam Das vs Smt. Mampi Das on 4 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/406689/ 1contention, she refers me to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Prabir Chandra Chatterjee v. Kaveri Guha Chatterjee . On the other hand, Mr. L.R. Das, the learned Counsel for the respondent, submits that the divorce petition may have been wrongly labelled as one under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, but when the petition apparently discloses a cause of action for divorce on the grounds of acts of cruelty under Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act, which is the case here, the learned District Judge, Shillong, certainly has the jurisdiction to entertain the divorce petition and grant appropriate relief; it is a settled position of law that errors in nomenclature cannot be a ground for ousting the jurisdiction of the District Court to try the divorce petition inasmuch as it is one constituted as a District Court for the purpose of the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. Strong reliance is placed by him on the decision of the Apex Court in Challamane Huchha Gowda v. M.R. Tura to buttress his contention. Drawing my attention to Prabir Chandra Chatterjee case (supra), the case cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, he forcefully submits that this case, instead of helping the case of the petitioner, applies to the instant case on all fours. In that view of the matter, according to the learned Counsel for the respondent, the impugned proceeding and order do not suffer from any infirmity warranting the interference of this Court. 4. There is no dispute at the bar that the learned District Court, Shillong has the jurisdiction to entertain a divorce petition both under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. Incidentally, it may also be noticed that the act of ""cruelty"" is one of the grounds for dissolving a marriage by a decree of divorce which is common to both Hindu Marriage Act and Special Marriage Act, Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act provides that any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party has, after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty. Similarly, Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act says that subject to the provisions of the Act and to the rules made thereunder, a petition for divorce may be presented to the district Court either by the husband or the wife on the ground that the respondent has since the solemnization of the marriage treated the petitioner with cruelty. A careful reading of the pleadings of the petitioner will show that it is not his pleaded case at this stage that the divorce petition of the respondent does not disclose any cause of action. It may be recalled that the divorce petition was filed by the respondent under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, while the miscellaneous applications for maintenance were filed under Section 25 of the same Act and Section 20(3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act respectively. Corresponding provisions for interim maintenance in the form of alimony pendente lite in respect of the wife is engrafted by the legislature in Section 36 of the Special Marriage Act. Similarly, a corresponding provision for interim maintenance of a child is found in Section 38 of the Special Marriage Act. 5. In Prabir Chandra Chatterjee case (supra), a matrimonial proceeding was initiated by the wife by a petition of divorce of her marriage with her husband on various grounds like cruelty, adultery, etc. The petition for divorce was labelled as one both under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and the reason for the same appeared to be that the marriage between the parties were first solemnized according to Hindu rites under the Hindu Marriage Act and was thereafter registered as well under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. TheirAnupam Das vs Smt. Mampi Das on 4 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/406689/ 2Lordships of the Calcutta High Court held that if the marriage of the wife with the husband, though celebrated and solemnized according to Hindu rites, was thereafter duly registered under Chapter III of the Special Marriage Act, the ongoing matrimonial proceeding should be governed by Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and not by Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. And in that case, labelling the petition under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act as one ""under Section 13, Hindu Marriage Act"" also was useless surplusage, which, at any rate, could not affect the maintainability or merit of the petition for divorce, nor the jurisdiction of the Court to grant divorce, if any case, therefore, was eventually made out at the trial. 6. In the instant case, the facts tell the story in reverse in that the solemnization of the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent under the Special Marriage Act preceded their marriage solemnization according to Hindu rites. Nevertheless, the principles of law involved in the instant case will be one and the same. In this connection, the subsequent observations of the Calcutta High Court in Prabir Chandra Case (supra), which are found at paragraph 4, are instructive, and the same is reproduced hereunder in extenso hereunder: But, we however, have not at all been able to understand the submission made by Mr. Chatterjee that because of such amalgamation of the sections of the Hindu Marriage Act as well as the Special Marriage Act in the heading of the petition, the petition ""does not disclose a cause of action"" within the meaning of Order 7. Rule 11 of the Civil PC to warrant its rejection thereunder. The petition apparently discloses a cause of action for divorce on the grounds of acts of cruelty, adultery etc. and if those allegations are proved on evidence at the trial, it would be for the Court to grant appropriate relief under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act or the Special Marriage Act, by which the marriage in question would appear to the Court to be governed. 7. As already noticed, it is not the case of the learned Counsel for the petitioner, at least for the purpose of this proceeding, that the petition for divorce filed by the respondent does not, prima facie, disclose any cause of action for divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act. The moot point then is whether wrong labelling of a petition can be a ground for non-suiting the respondent. I have already noted earlier that ""cruelty"" as a ground for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce is available both under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and under Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act and that the District Court at Shillong also has the jurisdiction to entertain a divorce petition under both the Acts. What happens in the instant case at worst is that errors in pleadings have undoubtedly crept in on both the petition for divorce and the miscellaneous application for interim maintenance. Can the respondent, who is admittedly a lay person, be penalized for the defects in the pleadings made by her counsel? In N Mani v. Sangeetha Theatre and Ors. (2004) 12 SCC 278, the Apex Court observes: 9. It is well settled that if an authority has a power under the law, merely because while exercising that power the source of power is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to a wrong provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power as long as the power does exist and can be traced to a source available.Anupam Das vs Smt.

On the 19th day of September, 1958 the petitioner Monika Das Gupta falsely called Monika Roy filed this petition for declaration that the marriage between her and Promode Kumar Roy performed on 8-2-1958 is null and void. 2. On 8-2-1958 the petitioner who was then a spinster of about 26 years of age was married to Promode Kumar Roy then a bachelor of about 35 years of age at No. 54A Amherst Street in the town of Calcutta. 3. The petitioner and the respondent lived and cohabited from the said 8th day of February, 1958 until the 5th day of March, 1958 at 54A Amherst Street, Calcutta and 12/1A Hindustan Park, Calcutta. The respondent never consummated the marriage by carnal copulation, for according to the petitioner the respondent was, by reason of his impotency or malformation, legally incompetent to consummate the said marriage and to enter into the said marriage. 4. On or about 13-2-1958 the petitioner disclosed the fact of impotency of her husband to Shephali Das Gupta, wife of the petitioner's brother. 5. On or about 25-5-1959 an order for amendment of the petition was directed. The amended petition contains the following paragraph: ""That your petitioner comas of a respectable vaidya family and has suffered a good deal because of the facts hereinbefore stated. That your petitioner states that the claim in this suit cannot be adequately valued but she values the relief in this suit for the purpose of jurisdiction only at Rs. 50,000/. That this Hon'ble High Court and not the Calcutta City Civil Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this suit."" 6. On 18-9-1959, this suit was heard as an undefended suit before me. 7. Monika Das Gupta said before me that her husband attempted to consummate the marriage on several occasions without success. This led her to guess that there was some malformation of the physical organ of her husband. 8.

Mr. Tamanash Chandra Das Gupta, father of the petitioner and Principal, Nabagram Hiralal College, Konnagar, said that on 19th February the deplorable information reached his ears through Shephali along with his daughter who was there. He thought over the matter and sent for Dr. Achudananda Sarkar. 11. Mr. Das Gupta further said that on the 20th February, 1959 Promode Kumar Roy agreed to be examined by a Specialist. On the next morning, however, Promode Kumar refused to be examined by a Specialist. 12. Dr. Achudananda Sarkar said that he was called on 20-2-1958 to examine Promode Roy. 13. On 20-2-1958, he agreed to be examined by a. Specialist or to have some pathological examination. On the next day Promode refused to have either pathological examination or consult a Specialist. 14. Dr. Sarkar further said that he decided to have pathological examination first and thereafter, if necessary, he would consult Dr. Souren Ghose, F. R. C. S., Specialist in venereal diseases. 15. On the evidence before me I hold that the respondent Promode Kumar Roy was impotent and incapable of consummating the marriage. 16. This finding in favour of the petitioner, however, does not conclude the matter for this petition gives rise to a question relating to the jurisdiction of the High Court in its Original Civil, jurisdiction to hear and determine such suits and/or proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. 17.

The appeal arises out of a petition by a Hindu husband under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act against his Hindu wife -- the first respondent in the petition -- for judicial separation. The ground of the petition is that on the 21st of July, 1963 the first respondent committed adultery with the second respondent impleaded in the petition. Judicial separation was granted by the learned Judge holding that the first respondent has been guilty of adultery with the second respondent on 21st of July, 1963. Along with the order allowing judicial separation the court below directed the petitioner to pay maintenance to the first respondent at the rate of Rs. 25/- per mensem under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Judge decreed maintenance to the first respondent on the following reasoning: ""It has been held that in the case of an unchaste wife whose marriage has been dissolved on the ground of her living in adultery bare maintenance allowance or starving allowance alone was permissible and the allowance under the section was to prevent starvation and not claimable as a matter of absolute right irrespective of the conduct of the claimant--vide page 1064 Hindu Law by Raghavachari, 5th edition. A judicial separation has been decreed in this case on the ground of adultery. Therefore the wife is entitled only to bare maintenance allowance. I think considering the financial position of the husband and the needs of the parties a monthly allowance of Rs. 25/- would constitute such an allowance and in view of the outrageous conduct of the wife which has provided the ground for the order of judicial separation I would grant it only from this date payable monthly."" The appeal is by the petitioner against the order of the court below allowing maintenance to the respondent. The respondent has filed a memorandum of cross-objection for enhancement of the amount decreed by the court below. The order srantine judicial separation has become final as there is no appeal by the respondent. 2. The plea of the appellant is that since judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriase Act has been granted on the ground of adultery the respondent is not entitled to maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. An extreme position was taken that in such cases a court has no jurisdiction under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act to decree maintenance. Apart from Section 25 (3) of the Hindu Marriage Act learned counsel for the appellant relied on the decision in Raia Gopalan v. Rajamma. 1966 Ker LT 891 = (AIR 1967 Ker 181) to support his contention. Section 25 (3) of the Hindu Marriage Act reads: ""If the court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been made under this section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she has not remained chaste, or, if such party is the husband, that he has had sexual intercourse wth any woman outside wedlock, it shall rescind the order.""Kaithakulangara Kunhikannan vs Nellatham Veettil Malu on 2 March, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1219775/ 1Counsel for the appellant contended that when unchastity on the part of a wife subseauent to an order under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act is a ground for its cancellation the legislature would not have intended grant of maintenance to her when she was guilty of adultery before the filing of the petition for judicial separation or for divorce. Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act reads: ""Anv court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other pro-perty of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent."" The above provision does not affect the jurisdiction of the court to grant maintenance depending on the grounds decreeing judicial separation or for divorce. Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, no doubt, confers a discretion in the Court to award maintenance. It is one thing to say that a finding that a wife is guilty of adultery for the purpose of an order for judicial separation under Section 10 or that she was living in adulterv for the purpose of an order of divorce under Sec-ton 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act will deprive the Court of its jurisdiction to award maintenance and it is a different thing to say that in fixing the quantum of maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court should take into consideration the conduct of the wife as found in the order allowing judicial separation or granting divorce. 3. In 1966 Ker LT 891 = (AIR 1967 Ker 181) Vaidialingam, J. has followed a bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Sachindra Nath v. Banamala AIR 1960 Cal 575, and has refused to follow the decision of a single Judge of the same High Court in Amar Kanta v. Soyana. AIR 1960 Cal 438. In Sachindra Nath v. Banamala, AIR 1960 Cal 575, the decision in Amar Kanta v. Sovana AIR 1960 Cal 438, has not been referred to. In the former case it was found on a Petition under Section 13 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act that there was reliable evidence to show that the wife was living in adultery with the co-respon-dent even at the time when the case was being heard by the District Judge. In those circumstances, the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court said: ""Unchastity on the part of a woman (and also sexual intercourse by a man with a woman outside wedlock) are sins against the ethics of matrimonial moralitv in this country, Moral law, it is true, is not the positive Civil law of a country, but there are many instances where law and morality meet. In our opinion, such a meeting place of law and moralitv is Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, or for the matter of that Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. In the exercise of judicial discretion, expressly vested in Courts of Law under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, a Judge should, unless there be very special grounds, leave a wife divorced on the ground of Droved unchastity or adultery, to the resources of her immorality and deny her the lawful means of support,Kaithakulangara Kunhikannan vs Nellatham Veettil Malu on 2 March, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1219775/ 2by passing a decree for maintenance in her favour."" The view that in the absence of very special grounds the courts should leave a wife to the resources of her immorality is not justified by the wording of the Section. The above observations were made in a case where the wife was persisting in living in adultery even when the case was being heard by the District Judge. The observations made by the Judges of the Calcutta High Court have to be understood in the light of the facts in the case. They cannot be understood as meaning that the court has no jurisdiction or its jurisdiction is in any way curtailed in awarding maintenance in cases of proved adultery. 4. In AIR 1960 Cal 438, there was a dissolution of the marriage on the ground that the wife had been living in adultery, Datta J. dealing with Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act pointed out: ""In my opinion on the authorities referred to she is entitled to a bare subsistence allowance or starving allowance. When she is earning a living and is not in helpless position her right to maintenance, even of the bare subsistence disappears for the allowance is meant to pre-vent 'starvation' "" In 1966 Ker LT 891 = (AIR 1967 Ker 181) Vaidialingam, J. posed the question in the following manner: ""Where a charge of adultery is the very foundation of a claim for asking judicial separation and that claim is accepted by a court notwithstanding that finding the respondent against whom that finding has been entered, can claim, as of right, to be awarded maintenance under Section 25 of the Act"" The learned Judge answered the above question thus: ""In my opinion, if a subsequent conduct of the wife who has become unchaste can form the basis, for cancellation of an order passed under Setton 25 (1), a finding recorded during the iudicial separation proceedings regarding the unchastitv of the wife must and should be taken into account even in the first instance, when an order is being passed under Section 25 (1) of the Act. Otherwise it will lead, in my opinion, to a very incongruous situation namely that it is only when a wife becomes unchaste after the award of maintenance she is disabled from continuing to receive that maintenance, whereas a wife who has been held puiltv by the court of unchastity even in the main proceedings, will nevertheless be entitled to act maintenance, in the first instance under Section 25 (1) of the Act."" Again at Page 902 the learned Judge observed: ""Section 25 (1) in my opinion, contemplates the case of a claim of wife who is chaste at that time and who has been chaste during the matrimonial relationship. This view finds support from the expression 'if such party is the wife, that she has not remained chaste' occurring in Section 25 (3). Section 25 (3) proceeds on the basis that the wife was chaste when the order under Section 25 (1) was passed but has not remained chaste after the date of the order under Section 25 (1). If the wife was found guilty of the act referred to in Section 10 (1) (f), as in this case, that means she was notKaithakulangara Kunhikannan vs Nellatham Veettil Malu on 2 March, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1219775/ 3","['13', '18', '25', '10']"

This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act by the wife who is the respondent in the lower Court, questioning the decree passed for judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act in O.P. No. 209 of 1986, filed by the husband respondent herein, seeking divorce under Section 13(l)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, by dissolving the marriage between the appellant and the respondent. 1. The case of the respondent as stated in the Original Petition, filed before the lower Court is as follows :- He married the appellant in the year 1977 at the house of the appellant's parents at Shah Inayat Gunj, Hyderabad according to Vedic rites and the customs of the community to which the parties belong. A daughter and a son were born in lawful wedlock. They are named, Vandana and Raghavender respectively. The appellant is the daughter of the maternal uncle of the respondent. His maternal uncle is doing of Transport business and he has got lorries. He is financially sound, whereas he is working as a lorry driver and financially weak. Therefore, the appellant was always complaining that she has no amenities like T.V., Refrigerator at her husband's house. She was also visiting Cinema Houses frequently for seeing pictures. He also worked as A.P.S.R.T.C. Bus Driver for sometime and his services were terminated as he had participated in strike. Thereafter, he worked with his father-in-law for sometime on the promise that he would be made a share-holder. But, when he demanded his share. He was assured that he would be given a cash of Rs. 25,000/- which was also not given. Eventhough he tried his best as a lorry driver to keep his wife happy with the meagre income he was getting, the appellant was not happy and she quarrelled with him and as a result of which, on 27-4-1986 her father came, abused him and took her away and inspite of his best efforts to get her back, he could not succeed. When all his efforts failed, he sent a lawyer's notice on 10-5-1986 and filed the petition seeking dissolution of marriage thereafter. 2. The appellant filed her counter in the lower Court denying all the above allegations. The marriage and birth of two children were admitted by her. Her case is that her father gave her jewellery worth Rs. 26,000/-and other articles worth Rs. 9.000/-. In addition to the above, he spent Rs. 15.000/- towards marriage expenses on behalf of both sides. After the marriage, they lived happily till 1980, by which time two children were born. Afterwards, she noticed change in the attitude and behaviour of her husband and he used to pick up quarrels over triffling matters, thereby abusing and beating her mercilessly for no fault of hers. The reason behind this attitude and ill-treatment was that he had fallen in love with a girl by name Santha, working as a teacher in a private school Lal Bahadur Shastri School at Nim-boliadda, Hyderabad and on account of this love-affair, her husband started neglecting her from 1980 onwards. The intimacy of her husband with Santha developed to the extent that the said girl frequented her visits to their house in her presence and she had been spending most of the day time with her husband. She resented her visits and requested her husband to prevent her. But, he never liked it. He beat her and drove her out of the house. Then, she came toC. Meena vs C. Suresh Kumar on 29 December, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1366172/ 1her parents house from there, she wrote personally a letter to the said girl on 4-8-1981 dissuading her from developing intimacy with her husband. She also wrote a letter to father of the girl Sri K.K. Parameswaran with the same request. The said Santha also wrote a letter dated 13-1-1983 and the house of her husband has become a hell for her and she had tolerated this with patience but there was no change in the attitude of her husband and other family members. She denied having received any notice issued by her husband. She finally stated that the petition is filed by her husband to cover up his own wrongs and to avoid her. Therefore, it has to be dismissed. 3. The respondent-husband examined himself as P.W. 1 besides examining his mother as P.W. 2. He also filed Exs. A-l to A-3 documents-the alleged notices and the returned covers. The appellant herein, has examined herself as R.W.1. and marked Exs. B-l to B-4 documents. The lower Court framed the point viz., whether the petitioner is entitled for divorce on the ground of cruelty ? The learned trial Judge found that the behaviour of the appellant cannot be termed as amounting to mental cruelty, but there is desertion by her from 27-4-1988. He also found that the demand of the appellant for purchase of T.V. and Refrigerator appears to be unreasonable and unfair, but however, he expressed that he is not prepared to accept the contention of the respondent that there is irretrievable break down of the marriage and it is not difficult for them to retrieve themselves and come together. Therefore, he rejected the relief for dissolution of marriage by divorce, but however, he granted judicial separation as the appellant has deserted the petitioner and as the petition was filed within two months of the respondent leaving her matrimonial house. This order is challenged by wife in this Appeal. 4. Now, the question that falls for consideration in this Appeal is, whether the respondent is entitled for Judicial separation ? 5. The marriage between the parties was performed in the year 1977. Till 1980 both the .spouses lived happily and they were also blessed with two children. Thereafter, differences arose. The case of the respondent-husband is that his wife is pestering him for providing aminities like T.V.,and refrigerator etc., and as he is not in a position to provide them, she was unhappy. She used to compare the status of her father and the amenities available in her fathers' house with that of her husband and used to feel unhappy. As she was not happy in his house, although he tried his best to make her happy, she left his house on her own accord and deserted him, thereby leaving the children also. On the other hand, it is the case of the appellant that they were happy till 1980, by which time two children were born and thereafter.he developed intimacy with one Santha, a teacher working in a private school and she also frequented her visits to their house and she was spending long time, eventhough the appellant was present in the house and the appellant did not like this attitude and as she complained, the respondent became furious and started ill-treating her. On 27-4-1986 the respondent beat the appellant severely and drove her out of the house with clothes on her person. As the respondent's brother had also beat her, she gave a police complaint. The respondent and her other family members made her life miserable and she has no other go except to take shelter in the house of her father. 6. In view of these rival contentions, the question whether the appellant has deserted the respondent or the respondent has made the appellant's life miserable and drove her out, has to be seen in theC. Meena vs C. Suresh Kumar on 29 December, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1366172/ 2light of the evidence and other circumstances. 7. It may be noticed that the Original petition was filed under Section 13(l)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, which sets out the ground of cruelty after the solemnisation of the marriage. There is absolutely no evidence adduced by the respondent establishing that the appellant had treated him with cruelty. It is seen that the Original Petition was filed within a period of two months of the respondent leaving her matrimonial home. Therefore, evidently, the respondent could not seek dissolution of marriage on the ground that she has deserted him for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition as envisaged under Section 13(l)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 8. The respondent as P.W. 1 stated that on 27-4-1986 the appellant left the house with all her belongings to the house of her father and when he went there and asked her to come, the father of the appellant stated that he had committed a mistake by giving his daughter in marriage to a beggar and therefore, he returned home. In Ex. A-1, Notice issued by the respondent, he did not mention that the appellant left the house with all her belonging or that her father stated that he had committed a mistake in giving his daughter in marriage to a beggar. What all he had stated in the petition and in the evidence adduced is about the conduct of the appellant in insisting to purchase a T.V. and Refrigerator, etc., The appellant in her evidence denied that she started demanding the' respondent to purchase a Refrigerator or a T.V. but she stated that the root cause for their fall out is the intimacy of her husband with Santha. 9.The learned Judge has stated in para-13 of his judgment as follows : ""I have already observed that the demand for purchase of T.V. and Refrigerator does not amount to cruelty"". Having found that the respondent failed to establish cruelty, he should have dismissed the petition. The learned Judge further observed that he is not prepared to accept the contention of the Counsel for the respondent that there is irretrievable break down of the marriage and it is not difficult for both of them to retrieve themselves and come together. But the learned Judge felt that the respondent herself went away to her parents house and therefore, there is desertion by the appellant from 27-4-1988. Hence curiously the learned Judge has granted Judicial separation. He lost sight of the ingredients which should be made out before granting the relief of judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. If the learned Judge is of the opinion that the appellant has deserted the petitioner, even to grant the relief of Judicial separation, desertion by the appellant must be for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. The learned Judge observed that the petition was filed within two months from the date of leaving of the house by the appellant. In view of the evidence and the findings of the learned Judge, grant of relief under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act is misconceived and unwarranted. No doubt, Section 13-A provides for grant of alternative relief of decree for Judicial separation, when a petition for dissolution of marrige by a Decree of divorce is filed, if the Court considers it just to do so, having regard to the circumstances of the case. But this Section should be read with Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The grounds on which a decree for Judicial separation can be passed are the same as that of a decree for divorce. So unless a case for divorce is made out, the question of granting Judicial separation docs not arise. Therefore, on aC. Meena vs C.

The appellant is the complainant and the respondents are the accused 1 to 8 before the lower Court. This appeal is preferred by the Appellant/Complainant against the order of acquittal of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate at Chengalpattu passed on 14-4-1988 in C.C. No. 391 of 1986. 2. The Appellant/Complainant filed a complaint before the lower Court stating as follows :- The Appellant/Complainant is the legally wedded wife of the 1st Respondent/1st Accused. The marriage between them was solemnised on 9-9-1984 at Kattuppakkam Village within the limits of Uthiramerur police station in Chengalpattu District. The Appellant/Complainant and the 1st Respondent/1st Accused were living happily at Kattuppakkam Village for about a year. The 2nd accused is the daughter of the 3rd accused and the 4th accused. The 5th accused is the brother of the 2nd accused. The 8th accused is the relative of the accused 1 and 2 and they are residents of Kattuppakkam Village. The 6th and 7th accused are the relatives of the 3rd accused. The 1st respondent/1st Accused began to illtreat the Appellant/Complainant a year after the marriage that took place on 9-9-1984. The 1st accused was neglecting and avoiding the company of the Appellant/Complainant. The efforts of the Appellant/Complainant for mediation also failed. The Appellant/Complainant learnt from the witnesses viz., Rajagopal, Poongavanam and Nataraja Gounder that the 1st accused married the 2nd accused on 22-9-1985 at Sakthi koil in Athur near Thozhupedu. The 1st accused and the 2nd accused exchanged the garlands and then the 1st accused tied the 'Thali' around the neck of the 2nd accused in the presence of deity of Sakthi koil. The accused 3 to 8 actually assisted the solemnisation of their marriage and the connected functions at the time of their marriage. The 1st accused did not return to the village after his second marriage. All the accused had the knowledge that the first marriage of the Appellant/Complainant with the 1st accused is still subsisting. The Appellant/Complainant learnt that the aforesaid second marriage was later registered at the Sub-Registrar Office at Acharapakkam on 23-12-1985. The parents of the complainant obtained an extract from the Sub-Registrar's Office at Acharapakkam regarding the registration of the second marriage between the 1st and the 2nd accused. On 29-5-1986, the 1st accused and the 2nd accused along with the accused 3 to 5 came to live in the house of the 1st accused. When the appellant/complainant questioned the same, the 1st accused came to assault her. The relatives of the complainant tried for settlement and it was of no avail. Thus the 1st accused and the 2nd accused have committed an offence of bigamy under Section 494 of IPC and the accused 3 to 8 have committed the offence punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109 of IPC. 3. Copies of the complaint were furnished to all the accused. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate at Chengalpattu framed the charge under Section 494 of I.P.C. as against the accused 1 and 2 and the charge under Section 494 read with Section 109 of I.P.C. against the accused 3 to 8. When questioned in respect of the charges framed against them, the Respondent/Accused denied the same and claimed to be tried. In proof of the charges framed against the accused, the complainantManjula vs Mani And Others on 11 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/517344/ 1examined P.Ws. 1 to 3 and filed the documents marked as Exs.P1 and P2. 4. When questioned under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. with reference to the incriminating circumstances appearing in the evidence on the side of the complainant, the Respondents/Accused denied their complicity in the crime. However the 1st Respondent/1st Accused would state in Tamil as follows :- So also the 2nd Respondent/2nd Accused would state in the proceedings under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. in Tamil in the following words :- Thus both the accused 1 and 2 would state that even though there was no marriage, they registered their marriage in the Office of the Sub-Registrar in view of the earlier intimacy between them. The Respondents/Accused did not choose to examine any witness on their side. 5. On consideration of the materials placed before him, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate at Chengalpattu found all the accused not guilty of the offences with which they are charged and acquitted all the accused under Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. Aggrieved against the order of acquittal, the Appellant/Complainant has come up in appeal. 6. After hearing the learned counsel for the Appellant/Complainant and the learned counsel for the Respondents/Accused, the point that arises for determination is as to whether the complainant has proved her case beyond all reasonable doubt and as to whether the Respondents 1 and 2 Accused 1 and 2 are guilty of the offence of bigamy under Section 494 of I.P.C. and as to whether the Respondents 3 to 8/Accused 3 to 8 are guilty of the offence under Section 494 read with Section 109 of I.P.C. and if so, what is the sentence to be imposed on the Respondents/Accused. 7. Point :- It is the case of the complainant that the 1st accused by name Mani married the 2nd accused by name Panchalai on 20-12-1985 at about 9-30 a.m. in the Sakthi koil at Athur while the 1st marriage between the appellant Manjula and the 1st accused Mani was subsisting, and later the accused 1 and 2 have registered their marriage on 23-12-1985 at the Sub-Registrar Office at Acharapakkam and thereby the accused 1 and 2 have committed the offence of bigamy punishable under Section 494 of I.P.C., and the accused 3 to 8 abetted the commission of the offence of bigamy between the accused 1 and 2 and thereby the accused 3 to 8 have committed an offence punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109 of I.P.C. 8. To prove the accusation made against the accused the Appellant/Complainant examined herself as P.W. 1 Manjula and one P.W. 2 Rajagopal, who is alleged to have seen the second marriage between the accused 1 and 2, and P.W. 3 Vedanayaki, who is the clerk in the Sub-Registrars Office at Acharapakkam and, who produced the extract from the Hindu Marriage Register from the Sub-Registrar's Office at Acharapakkam marked as Ex.P 2 in this case. P.W. 1 Manjula and P.W. 3 Vedanayaki had no personal knowledge about the second marriage that took place between the accused 1 and 2. So the only witness who had seen the occurrence of the second marriage between the accused 1 and 2 on 20-12-1985 at Athur is P.W. 2 Rajagopal. His evidence was disbelieved by the trial Court for three reasons as set out in the middle of Para 8 of the Judgment of the lower Court in the following words in Tamil :-Manjula vs Mani And Others on 11 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/517344/ 2Thus the lower Court disbelieved the testimony of the only eye witness examined witness examined as P.W. 2 Rajagopal on the ground that he went towards south to purchase bull and there was no necessity for him to go to Athur where the second marriage between the accused 1 and 2 took place, and P.W. 2 Rajagopal was unable to say on which side the passage of the temple was situated and he is aged 78 years and he had undergone cataract operation and so it cannot be believed that he had witness the second marriage at a distance of 25 feet in a gathering of 100 persons assembled there at the time of the second marriage between the accused 1 and 2. Now let us consider and reappraise his evidence as to whether it can be believed or not notwithstanding the finding recorded by the lower Court about the unreliability of the evidence of P.W. 2 Rajagopal. 9. The evidence of P.W. 2 Rajagopal given before the lower Court is extracted here in Tamil in extenso for better appreciation of his testimony. He stated in his chief-examination as well as in his cross-examination in Tamil as follows :- 10. Thus a careful reading of the entire evidence of P.W. 2 Rajagopal would show that about 11/2 years prior to his giving evidence he along with one Poongavanam went towards south for the purpose of purchase of bulls and the bulls were not available and so they came back to Kongarai Village and stayed there, and in the morning they proceeded to the village of Athur, and the distance between the village of Kongarai and Athur is 8 miles, and while at the village of Athur they came to know that marriage was taking place in Sakthi koil, and they went there and saw from a distance of 25 feet that the accused 1 and 2 with the garlands in their hands, and the accused 1 and 2 exchanged the garlands and thereafter the 1st accused tied the 'Thali' around the neck of the 2nd accused, and he did not ask them anything, and the he came back and informed the father of P.W. 1 Manjula as well as P.W. 1 Manjula. During his cross examination he stated that he could not purchase the bulls on that day but later on he purchased the bulls and there was no shandy at Athur, and his uncle's daughter was given in marriage in that village of Athur and he did not go to the house of his relative, and he is aged 78 years and he was able to see the persons in the Court, and he did not know the length and breadth of the temple and he did not know as to how many passages were there for the temple and he did not know how many deities were there in the temple, and there was no enmity between him and the accused, and on that day he did not go to them and he did not talk to them, and the said temple was Sakthi temple, and he did not know the year in which the marriage between the accused 1 and 2 took place, and he was not related to P.W. 1 Manjula but he was residing three houses away from the house of P.W. 1 Manjula, and he informed the father of P.W. 1 Manjula since he felt that he should inform the same P.W. 2 Rajagopal denied the suggestions that he was obliged to P.W. 1 Manjula, and his eye sight was poor, and he did not go to Athur on that day, and he was deposing falsey about the marriage of the accused 1 and 2 from his imagination. 11. A careful scrutiny of the evidence of P.W. 2 Rajagopal will show that his evidence is natural, cogent and convincing. Merely because he did not purchase the bulls on that day or he did not visit the house of his relatives at Athur, it cannot be said that he could not have gone to Athur Village. It is not even elicited from him that the village of Athur was situated at a far off place from his native village of Kattuppakkam. It seems from his evidence that himself and one Poongavanam stayed in the first instance at Kongarai and later they came to the village of Athur. There was no necessity for him also to stay at the village of Kongarai. It does not mean that he did not go to the village ofManjula vs Mani And Others on 11 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/517344/ 3","['24','10']"
197,"Calcutta High Court Chandra Mohan Majhi vs Smt. Kaushalya Majhi on 20 February, 1997 Equivalent citations: II (1997) DMC 214 Author: D Sircar-I Bench: D Sircar-I JUDGMENT D.P. Sircar-I, J. 1. In this criminal revisional application under Section 401 and Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code the order dated 27.2.1991 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Purulia in Misc. Case No. 81 of 89 of his Court has been challenged. 2. The present opposite party Kaushalya Majhi filed a petition before the learned S.D.J.M., Purulia against the petitioner in this revisional application Chandra Mohan Majhi @ Hembram under Section 125, Cr. P.C., alleging that Chandra Mohan married heron the 8th paisakh, 1394 B.S. corresponding to 22nd April, 1987, according to Hindu religious rites but subsequently resorted to torture upon her, assaulting her severely and driving her out of his house. Kaushalya prayed for maintenance from Chandra Mohan claiming that Chandra Mohan had sufficient income from cultivation as well as from business in vegetable. 3. Chandra Mohan challenged the petition denying flatly that there was any marriage at all between Kaushalya and himself and that he had any responsibility to maintain her. He also maintained that he had been brought up by his maternal uncle and had no income of his own. 4. The learned S.D.J.M. considered the evidence adduced before him, allowed the petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C. and directed the present petitioner Chandra Mohan to pay maintenance at the rate of Rs. 400.00 per month to Kaushalya and also to pay cost of Rs. 100.00 to her for this revisional application. The aggrieved 2nd party, Chandra Mohan filed his revisional application challenging that order of the learned S.D.J.M., Purulia. In the face of the stout denial by the 2nd party that there was no marriage at all, the learned S.D.J.M. held that Kaushalya, the 1st party, was entitled to get maintenance, as neglected legally married wife of the second party, rejecting the contention of the second party that the case of the 1st party was altogether false and that there was no marriage at all. The learned S.D.J.M. observed that in a petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C. marriage was not required to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt and if a valid marriage on preponderance of probability was proved, the Court should not go into the intricate question of law to find if there was a valid marriage. He again held on the other hand that, to claim maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. the petitioner-wife was to prove that she was a legally wedded wife of the opposite party but the standard of proof was not required to be so high as was required in a case under Sections 494/495/497/498, I.P.C. He also held that strict proof of ceremony of marriage was not necessary. 5. I am afraid that the learned S.D.J.M. over-simplified his responsibility and missed the correct legal stand point. It is true, in a case under Section 125, Cr. P.C. dispute about the marriage need not be so meticulously proved as in a dispute about marriage thrashed in a Civil Court or in the criminal proceeding under Sections 494/495/496/497, I.P.C. But that does not mean that the Court mustChandra Mohan Majhi vs Smt. Kaushalya Majhi on 20 February, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1967801/ 1accept too much credulously and naively whatever the 1st party asserts about her marriage. The Section 125, Cr.P.C, no doubt, provides a swift and cheap remedy against any person who despite means neglects or refuses to maintain his wife etc. and the primary object of this section is to prevent starvation and vagrancy and is a distinct and quite independent of the right which such wife etc. may or may not have under the personal law. But the term ""wife"" as used in this provision of law undoubtedly means only, legally wedded wife. Consequently, the 1 st party claiming to be wife of the 2nd party must prove that there was a lawfully recognized marriage. Standard of proof need not be so high as under the Divorce Act or under relevant provisions of I.P.C. to warrant a conviction; but the petitioner undoubtedly has to prove with sufficient materials that there was a marriage between the 1st party and the 2nd party as recognized by rites, custom prevalent among their society or secular legal provisions. A petition for maintenance cannot be just lightly allowed and in a slip-slod manner, without sufficient proof of solemnization of a marriage. In case of incident of long past sufficient evidence about living of the 1st party in the house and keeping of the 2nd party since long, recognition of the parties as spouses and of the children born out of such long standing living together which, may, by preponderance of probability, lead the Court to accept the plea that there was a lawful marriage. But under no circumstances, the 1st party just by claiming marriage can be absolved of the responsibility to prove the fact of marriage satisfactorily and sufficiently by reasonable standard of proof acceptable to a man of ordinary prudence. Without sufficient materials to establish the fact, the 2nd party cannot be saddled with the responsibility of marriage and of maintaining the 1st party. Consequently, we must hold that the 1st party claiming maintenance from the 2nd party had her responsibility to prove that there was a marriage as per religious rites and custom or secular legal provisions with the 2nd party and that she was the legally wedded wife of the 2nd party. The learned S.D.J.M.'s observation that ""in a petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C. marriage is not required to be proved beyond all reasonable doubts"" is, therefore, not justified and is likely to be over-ruled. That order has been challenged by this petitioner is this revisional application. 6. The learned Advocate for the petitioner argues before this Court that the claim of the 1st party-opposite party for maintenance is altogether false and must be dismissed as, (i) there was no marriage at all between the parties; (ii) at the time of the alleged marriage the present petitioner (2nd party in the petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C.) was a minor; (iii) the parties in this case belonged to Santhal community, and, as such, members of a Scheduled Tribe and marriage according to Hindu rites if any, was void; (iv) even if the Hindu Marriage Act is assumed to be applicable, the age of the petitioner-2nd party being below 21 years on the date, under Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act the marriage was illegal. 7. The learned Advocate for the petitioner argues that the parties, belonging to the Santhal community, had their own custom of marriage, which, undisputedly, not being followed, there was no marriage at all. He argues further that the 1st party opposite-party failed to adduce sufficient evidence about procedure and custom resorted to in the marriage. As such the finding of the learned Magistrate that there was a legally recognised wedding was quite unjustified, illegal, erroneous and must be set aside. He argues that the petitioner- 2nd party is a bachelor even now. He further argues that the petitioner-2nd party has no sufficient means and for that the order of the learned S.D.J.M. about maintenance was not justified. On the contrary, the 1st party-opposite party being anChandra Mohan Majhi vs Smt. Kaushalya Majhi on 20 February, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1967801/ 2able-bodied woman is quite capable of earning and maintaining herself. 8. The learned Advocate for the opposite party argues that the petitioner did not comply with the order of this Court dated 12.6.1991 and as such made himself liable for punishment for such violation of the order. He further argues that the party admits that although they are members of a Scheduled Tribe, they are governed by Hindu Law and the rituals and customs prevalent among the Hindus. Further in a case under Section 125, Cr. P.C. marriage need not be proved, and, further, there was no denial of marriage. 9. The arguments of the learned Advocate for the opposite party that there was no denial of marriage is altogether baseless. The 2nd party-petitioner stoutly challenged the first party's claim of marriage in unequivocal terms and asserted that there was no marriage at all. The argument of the learned Advocate for the opposite party that, in a petition under Section 125, Cr. P.C. the petitioner need not prove the fact of marriage satisfactorily is also incorrect, as may be found from the interpretation of law as discussed above. Only by pleading that there was marriage, the petitioner cannot get maintenance from the 2nd party. She must prove by sufficient and believable evidence that there was a legally valid marriage, recognised by law, the custom, or, the course of event prevailing since. long. Without proving by reasonable standard, acceptable to a man of ordinary prudence, that she is the legally wedded wife of the 2nd party, the 1st party is not entitled to get the maintenance. Therefore, we shall have now to examine whether the 1st party-opposite party has been able to prove by sufficient evidence that she is the legally married wife of the petitioner-2nd party. 10. The 1st party comes with the case that she was married by the 2nd party on 8th Baisakh, 1394 B.S. corresponding to 22nd April, 1987, according to Hindu religious rites and customs viz Saptapadi, Sindurdan, Homa etc. She does not have any case that the marriage was solemnized according to any procedure special to the members of the Scheduled Tribe which the parties undoubtedly belong to. If such a plea is proved to be true the 1st party must establish by reliable evidence that the family adopted the Hindu system of the so-called upper caste Hindus of Aryan origin by custom. The learned Advocate for the present petitioner-2nd party cites the provision of Section 2, Sub-section (2) of Hindu Marriage Act which provides that the Act is not applicable to the member of any Scheduled Tribe unless the Central Government by notification otherwise directs. The 1st party-opposite party claiming that the marriage was solemnized according to Hindu Law did not produce any such notification and hence the Court has no reasonable ground to hold that the parties are governed by Hindu Marriage Act. The 1st party, therefore, fails to prove that any provision of Hindu Marriage Act is applicable to any of the families of these parties in particular or to the Tribe in general. Consequently marriage, if any of these parties solemnized according to the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act was a nullity. And there is no case of marriage of these parties following the custom prevalent among their own community. 11. I am afraid, the situation would not much improve for the 1st party- opposite party, had she been able to produce any such notification. Even if we assume for arguments' sake that by any such notification, not produced in Court, the parties belonging to Santhal community (about which there is no dispute) they or either of them came under the spell of Hindu Marriage Act, the 1st party had to establish by reliable evidence the actual customary rites and ceremonies of the Hindu systemChandra Mohan Majhi vs Smt.

In the instant revisional application an important question of law has arisen for consideration of this Court, namely whether a suit, in which reliefs other than reliefs contemplated under the various provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act have been prayed for is to be filed before the Court of the learned District Judge under the provisions of S. 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act or before the Court of a learned Munsif. 2. The present petitioner as plaintiff filed a suit being Title Suit No. 93 of 1982 in the Court of the learned Munsif at Chandan-nagore against the opposite party inter alia on the pleadings that the opposite party is not legally married wife of the plaintiff and the opposite party did not acquire the status of wife of the plaintiff. The sum and substance of the case made out by the plaintiff in his plaint is that the plaintiff who is a Hindu while reading M.A. in the University of Calcutta became acquainted with the defendants some time in the year 1967-68 and such acquaitance developed into love and intimacy and finally they got married on 24th April, 1981 in the house of the defendant's father at Singuf according to the Hindu rites and after the marriage the parties resided together as husband and wife till 24th October, 1981. Subsequently the plaintiff came to know that the defendant opposite party is Christian by religion, a fact which was suppressed by defendant and her relatives before the marriage. Hence, the suit for declaration that the marriage is illegal, void and the defendant is not legally married wife of the plaintiff and she had not acquired the status of the wife and also for permanent injunction restraining the defendant from-claiming anything on the basis of the said marriage. 3. The defendant opposite party contested the suit by filing written statements denying all the material allegations in the plaint and specially allegation that it was not known to the plaintiff before the marriage that the defendant was Christian. 4. The learned Munsif framed number of issues in the suit including the issue whether the learned Munsif has jurisdiction to try such a suit. The aforesaid issue relation to the jurisdiction was taken up by the learned Munsif as a preliminary issue and the learned Munsif after hearing both the parties on the said issue by order No. 28 dt. 31-10-84 decided such issue against the plaintiff holding he had no jurisdiction to try the suit. By said order the learned Munsif has also directed the return of the plaint for filing the same before the Court having jurisdiction to try such suit. The learned Munsif was of the view that plaintiff having prayed for declaration that the marriage between the parties void, the learned Munsif has no jurisdiction to try such a suit and under S. 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Such a plaint is to be presented in the District Court. 5. On appeal by the plaintiff against the said order the learned District Judge, Hooghly by his judgment and by his order dt.Sasanka Sekhar Basu vs Miss Dipika Roy on 12 February, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257159/ 17th Oct., 1985 in Misc. Appeal No. 1 of 1985 has affirmed the order of the learned Munsif returning the plaint and, has dismissed the appeal. 6. Such order is under challenge under the present revisional application. 7. Mr. Dilip Kr. Seth appearing for the petitioner in support of the revisional application has submitted inter alia that both Courts below have committed jurisdictional error by directing return of the plaint completely overlooking that the suit filed by the plaintiff was not at all a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act within the meaning of S. 19 of the said Act as none of the reliefs which can be obtained under the said Act has been prayed for in the suit. He has further submitted inter alia that under S. 19 of the said Act only a petition filed under the said Act is required to be presented before the District Court and not otherwise. He has further contended inter alia that the suit filed by him is really a suit for declaration under the Specific Relief Act and although he has prayed inter alia for the relief such that the marriage between the parties is void, such relief has been asked for not on any of the grounds under which a marriage can be annulled under S. 11 or 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, but on the ground that subsequent to the solemnisation of the marriage between the parties and living for some time as husband and wife, the plaintiff came to know that the opposite party is Christian by religion, a fact which was suppressed by the opposite party and her parents and therefore there was no marriage between the parties and the opposite party therefore did not acquire the status of wife. The plaintiff therefore, submits Mr. Seth, is certainly entitled to file such suit for declaration before the Court of the learned Munsif. 8. Mr. Siba Pada Mukherjee, learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party after drawing my attention to the plaint filed in the suit specially to the paragraphs 5,7,11, 12 and 13 thereof has contended inter alia that it wiil appear from such pleading of the plaintiff himself that admittedly the marriage was solemnised between the parties under the Hindu rites and the parties after such marriage lived together for a few months as a husband and wife and accordingly, because of such admission of the plaintiff, the marriage between the parties cannot be annulled except by decree passed under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to Mr. Mukherjee no reliefs other than the reliefs provided for under the Hindu Marriage Act can be obtained by the parties to a marriage relating to matrimonial status before the Civil Court under the provisions of the Specific Relief Act. Mr. Mukherjee submitted that Hindu Marriage Act being a special statute excludes the jurisdiction of the Civil Court for grant of relief relating to matrimonial status except in the manner provided for under Hindu Marriage Act. 9. Mr. Seth in support of his contention that the plaintiff in his aforesaid suit not having claimed any relief under the Hindu Marriage Act, S. 19 of the said Act would not be applicable and, therefore, the plaintiff is certainly entitled to file the suit before the Court of the learned Munsif has relied on two decisions of this Hon'ble Court, namely, the cases of Krishna Pal v. Asoke Kr. Pal, reported in (1982) 2 Cal LJ 366 and in the case of Tapan Kr. Maitra v. Pratima Roy Chowdhury, reported in (1985) 89 Cal \VN 671. 10. In the said case of Krishna Pal v.Sasanka Sekhar Basu vs Miss Dipika Roy on 12 February, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257159/ 2Asoke Kr. Pal (1982) 2 Cal LJ 366, the defendant brought a suit for a declaration that no marriage between him and defendant No. 1 was solemnized according to Hindu Shastra and according to any other law and also for a declaration that the child born to defendant No. 1 was not by the loin of the plaintiff and also for a declaration that the entries relating the alleged marriage in Bankura sub-registry office dt. 21 Jan., 1977 was fradutent and null and void. In the said suit permanent injunction was also prayed for by the plaintiff to restrain the defendant No. 1 from claiming herself as married wife of the plaintiff or from asserting that the child given birth by her was born by the loins of the plaintiff. In the said suit the learned Munsif decided the issue No. 1 relating to his jurisdiction to try such suit in favour of the plaintiff by holding that the reliefs claimed by the plaintiff were not covered by Ss. 9 and 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Hon'ble Mr. Justice Chittotosh Mukherjee, (as his Lordship then was) held in the said case that in deciding the question at the preliminary stage as to the appropriate forum of filing the suit, the Court is not called upon to record, about the truth or otherwise of the allegations made in the plaint of the suit and the only question for consideration at the stage is whether on the basis of the allegations made in the plaint and the prayers contained therein, the suit is for a relief contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act. 11. In the said judgment his Lordship is clearly of the view that if the reliefs claimed in the suit are not reliefs which can be obtained under the various provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, S. 19 of the said Act will not be applicable and the suit can be filed before the learned Munsif. 12. In the case of Tapas Kr. Maitra v. Pratima Roy Chowdhury, reported in (1985) 89 Cal WN 671 the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Prabir Kumar Majumdar has also held, following the decisions in the aforesaid case of Krishna Pal v. Asoke Kr. Pal (1982 (2) Cal LJ 366) that in a suit where no relief is prayed which are available under the various provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the plaint in the said suit cannot be considered to be a petition under S. 19 of the said Act and the learned Munsif is fully competent and has jurisdiction to entertain, try and determine the suit. In the said case the plaintiff filed a suit asking for a declaration that the registration of the alleged marriage between the parties is declared null and void, for cancellation of the said purported registration of marriage and for restraining the defendant by a permanent injunction from executing an order of maintenance and cost in M.C. Case No. 271/77 of the Court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate. 13. The question therefore, which have come up for consideration of this Court as to whether S. 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act will be applicable even in a suit wherein reliefs other than reliefs contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act have been asked for and whether it is open to a party to a marriage to ask for any relief not contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act relating to the matrimonial status under the Specific Relief Act and to file a suit in respect thereof in the Court of the learned Munsif. 14. I respectfully agree with the above-mentioned two decisions of this Hon'ble Court. 15. In my view, S. 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act is applicable only in case of petitions filed under the said Act and not otherwise, as would be evident from the very language of the section itself, which is quoted hereunder :--Sasanka Sekhar Basu vs Miss Dipika Roy on 12 February, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257159/ 3",['11']

When this application came up for admission before one of us (Giridhar Malaviya, J.) learned counsel for the applicant placed reliance on the observations of Hon. Deoki Nandan, J, in the case of Smt. Premwati v, Mahesh Chandra, reported in 1980 Allahabad Criminal Rulings, page .70 wherein the Hon'ble Judge had quashed the proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. on the ground that the husband had filed a suit for divorce against his wife. As there were large number of cases of the Allahabad High Court as also the other High Courts which had taken a contrary view, the case was referred to large bench at the stage of admission itself so that the controversy may be decided. That is how this petition is now before us for admission. 2. It will be useful to consider the facts of the instant case. The applicant claims to have married opposite party No. 2 in Gyanpur on 23.2.1984. Thereafter the husband and wife lived in Allahabad where the applicant was posted, who is a resident of Mirzapur. It is claimed that in August, 1986, the ' real brother of Opp. Party No. 2 took her away to her father's place in the garb of visiting her ailing mother. When the applicant later went to the house of his father-in-law in Gopiganj, district-Varanasi he found that his mother-in-law wal hail and hearty and also learnt that his in-law would not send opposite party no. 2 with him on account of some mis-understanding. As 'his repeated efforts to bring back his wife failed he sent a registered legal notice through his counsel to opposite party No. 2 on 14.5.1987 asking her to join him without delay failing which he proposed to take legal action. A reminder sent on 15.6.1987 also yielded no result. Ultimately on 3.11.1987 applicant claims to have filed a suit under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act against opposite party No. 2 and his father-in-law in the Court of District Judge, Allahabad which was registered as Matrimonial Petition No. 148 of 1987 (Rajendra Prasad Gupta v. Smt. Mamta Devi). Despite several notices to opposite party No. 2, it is claimed by the applicant she did not appear in matrimonial suit, but instead opposite party No. 2, with the object of harassing the applicant, filed an application claiming maintenance from the applicant Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. which was numbered as Case No. 10 of 1987. On getting the notice of proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. from the Court of Munsif Magistrate I, Gyanpur, Varanasi, the applicant moved an application before him to drop the proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. on the ground that he had already filed a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights with the result that opposite party No. 2 could claim the maintenance in the matrimonial proceedings itself.. According to the applicant since opposite party no. 2 could seek the same relief in the matrimonial proceedings pending since before the initiation of proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C., it was nothing but an abuse of process of Court as also in unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings. The said applicationRajendra Prasad Gupta vs State Of U.P. And Ors. on 20 March, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1028985/ 1moved by the applicant having been dismissed by the Munsif Magistrate, I, Gyanpur, Varanasi by an order dated 23.2.1988, the applicant has filed the present application in the High Court under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the proceedings before the magistrate. 3. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued not only the law point involved in this case viz. whether in view of pendency of a petition under The Hindu Marriage Act an application Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. can still be maintained or not, he has also challenged the correctness of the impugned order dated 23.2.1988. According to learned counsel for the applicant the Court below erred in almost believing the plea and the contention of the learned counsel for the opposite party No. 2 that he had instituted matrimonial petition for restitution of conjugal rights in the Courts at Allahabad after getting the notice from the Court of the magistrate in proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. learned counsel says that whereas his suit under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act had been instituted on 3.11.1987 and was registered as Matrimonial Petition No. 148 of 1987, the opposite party no. 2 had moved her application Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. in the Court of Munsif Magistrate I, Gyanpur, Varanasi on 1.12.1987 i.e. almost 28 days after filing of the .matrimonial suit. Learned counsel further contends that the observation by the learned magistrate that the applicant's counsel had failed to show the provision under which proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. would be dropped, could not be good ground for the magistrate to reject his application for dropping the proceeding Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. Since we are going to consider the question whether the pendency of a matrimonial petition before the matrimonial Court should or should not be treated as a bar on the maintenance of a proceeding Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. we will obviously consider both these aspects while disposing of this matter. 4. It will be relevant to consider the scheme relating to alimony, so far as it is relevant for the present controversy, under the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides a petition to the district Court by either of the spouse for restitution of conjugal rights. Once the Court comes to the conclusion that either of the spouces had no reasonable excuse to withdraw from the society of the other it has to pass a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Similarly Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for a decree for divorce. By a series of decisions alimony and ad-interim maintenance to the aggrieved party has been held to be payable under Section 24 of the; Hindu Marriage Act during the pendency of a proceedings Under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Alimony during the proceedings as also after the decree for divorce have also been held to be admissible to an aggrieved party under Sections 24 and 25 of the said Act. 5. The contention of learned counsel for the applicant is that as the opposite party No. 2 could have claimed alimony in the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, there was no question of her seeking the same relief twice by filing a separate application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. 6. Section 125 Cr.P.C. contemplates that if any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his wife who is unable to maintain herself then the magistrate may make an order directing such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife at a rate not exceeding Rs. 500/- in whole. Sub-clause (4) of Section 125 Cr.P.C. provides that no wife could get an allowance from her husband under Section 125 Cr.P.C. if she was living in adultery or. if without any specific reason she had refused to live with .her husband or if they had started living separatelyRajendra Prasad Gupta vs State Of U.P.

In other words the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that since in both these proceedings the question will have to be considered whether the wife living separately from her husband without any specific reason or not, there was no point in permitting the proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. to continue when they were filed at a later stage. It has also been suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the present proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. having been initiated .after the opposite party No. 2 had come to know about the matrimonial suit, her action was clearly mala-fide and as mala-fides vitiate every action in the eyes of law the present proceedings Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. initiated by opposite party No. 2 against the applicant should be quashed. We will examine the contentions. 8. Although it is true that opposite party No. 2, the wife, could come to the Allahabad Courts and could claim pendentelite maintenance from her husband by filing an application Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the question to be considered is whether in view of a previously instituted proceeding against her under the Hindu Marriage Act. She is to be deprived other right to claim maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. from the Court where she is residing or not. The proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. are always treatedas summary proceedings. The Supreme Court has also now made it clear that during the pendency of an application Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. a wife is entitled to receive interim maintenance vide the case of Savitri v. Govind Singh reported in 1986 Supreme Court page 984. The provision for some amount of maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. has apparently been made looking at the peculiar circumstances under which neglected women, minor children and poor parents have been living in the society since long. This relief can be claimed by the aggrieved person Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. at the place of their own residence. Consequently to deny the said remedy to a neglected and hard pressed wife merely on the ground that she could claim it in a suit which she could defend and which may sometimes be pending at a place different from her place of residence, would almost render the facility and benefit which has been provided to her Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. nugatory. Consequently we have no hesitation to hold that a proceeding under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act can not operate as a bar to a proceeding of maintenance Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. . 9. Coming to the case of Premwati v. Mahesh Chandra (supra) we find that the application moved Under Section 125 Cr.P.C. by the wife in that case had been rejected by the Magistrate on the ground that she had not stated in the application that she was unable to prove that the opposite party was a bad 'character who beat her and was not maintaining her inspite of his having means to do so. Hon'ble Deoki Nandan, J. deciding that case found that the assertions of the Court below that Premwati had not stated in her application that she was unable to maintain herself was factually incorrect. The Hon'ble Judge also found that the finding of the Court below, that in the absence of a first information report against her husband and in getting herself medically examined the wife had failed to prove the allegations that her husband was a bad character and had beaten her, were bad as in this country the common conduct of such aggrieved wives was to quietly go back to their father's place and lodging a report against her husband was uncommon. The Hon'ble Judge. while setting aside the judgments of the two Courts below had observed in the last paragraph as follows : .Rajendra Prasad Gupta vs State Of U.P.

Rule. With consent of the learned Counsel for the parties the writ petition is taken up for final hearing. 2. This writ petition challenges Sub-clause (vi) of Clause 7 in Form A of the Delhi Hindu Marriage Registration Rules, 1956, as being ultravires of Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as well as being contrary to the mandate of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Seema v. Ashwini Kumar . 3. The relevant facts necessary for disposal of the present writ petition are as follows: (a) The petitioner No. 1 got married with petitioner No. 2 in Delhi according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and both the petitioners are citizens of India. The petitioners approached the Office of Register of Marriages, New Delhi for the purpose of registration of their marriage which had been solemnized at New Delhi. However, the Registrar of Marriages declined to register their marriage on the ground that the petitioner No. 1 and 2 and their parents were not residents of Delhi. This led to petitioners approaching the Office of the Registrar of Marriages, NOIDA, where the parents of petitioner No. 2 resided. However, the Registration of Marriages, NOIDA declined to register their marriage on the ground that the marriage of the petitioner No. 1 and 2 was not solemnized within his jurisdiction and, furthermore, the petitioner No. 1, i.e., the husband, did not reside within his jurisdiction. Similar fate met the petitioners when they approached the Office of Registrar of Marriages at Jaipur, though at that time, parents of the petitioner No. 1 were residing in Rajasthan. (b) Petitioner No. 1 and 2 who were at that time in Maldives where the petitioner No. 1 was working in a hotel, also sought the registration of their marriage with the Ambassador of India in Maldives, but the said prayer was declined by the Ambassador on the ground that he had no powers to register the marriage. 4. Consequently, it is submitted by Mr. V.P. Singh, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the registration of marriage is necessary because of a child which is soon expected and non-registration of marriage may create problems for seeking a passport for the new arrival. He further submitted as in any event the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Seema v. Ashwini Kumar (supra) has already laid the law as follows: 15. ...As is evident from narration of facts, though most of the States have framed rules regarding registration of marriages, registration of marriage is not compulsory in several States. If the record of marriage is kept, to a large extent, the dispute concerning solemnization of marriages between two persons is avoided. As rightly contended by the National Commission, in most casesVikram Aditya Singh And Ors. vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 11 October, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1611764/ 1non-registration of marriages affects the women to a great measure. If the marriage is registered it also provides evidence of the marriage having taken place and would provide a rebuttable presumption of the marriage having taken place. Though, the registration itself cannot be a proof of valid marriage per se, and would not be the determinative factor regarding validity of a marriage, yet it has a great evidentiary value in the matters of custody of children, right of children born from the wedlock of the two persons whose marriage is registered and the age of parties to the marriage. That being so, it would be in the interest of the society if marriages are made compulsorily registrable. The legislative intent in enacting Section 8 of the Hindu Act is apparent from the use of the expression ""for the purposes of facilitating the proof of Hindu marriages. 17. Accordingly, we are of the view that marriages of all persons who are citizens of India belonging to various religions should be made compulsorily registrable in their respective States, where the marriage is solemnized. 5. Mr. Singh has further submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in connection with the interpretation of Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, has thus held that marriage should be registered in the State, where the marriage is solemnized and consequently, no rule or a form could stipulate terms contrary to the said binding position of law. 6. In so far as the present case is concerned, the impugned amendment in so far as this writ petition is concerned reads as follows: Amendment of Form A - In the Delhi Hindu Marriage Registration Rules, 1956, Form A, Clause 7, for Sub Clause (vi), the following sub-clause shall be substituted, namely- (iv) One of the parties or his/her parent is residing within the jurisdiction of the Registrar, for more than thirty days. 7.

Kundu, J. 1. In this writ proceeding, as appears from the cause title of the writ application, the writ petitioners are ""(1) Sri Chandra Nath Sadhu, son of Jatirindra Nath Sadhu, of Masterpara, P.O. Tribeni, District: Hooghly, at present residing at 62, Benimadhabtala, Post Office: Tribeni, Police Station: Mogra, District: Hooghly and (2) Sri Subham Laha, being minor represented by his adoptee father Chandra Nath Sadhu, residing at 62, Benimadhabtala, Post office: Tribeni, P.S.: Mogra, District: Hooghly"". The respondent No. 4 in the writ application is Smt. Sutapa (Laha) Sadhu, daughter of Jatirindra Nath Sadhu, 62, Benimadhabtala, Post office: Tribeni, Police Station: Mogra, District: Hooghly. The respondent No. 4 is the natural mother of the writ petitioner No. 2. The writ petitioner No. 1 claims to be the adoptive father of the writ petitioner No. 2. 2. On 24.3.2003 this Court passed the following order: ""Leave granted to the learned advocate for the petitioner to add the name of Santanu Laha son of Late Jagat Laha of Barasat, 34, Dasabhujatala, Chandernagore, P.O. & P.S. Chandernagore, District: Hooghly as added respondent No. 5 here and now. The petitioner is directed to serve copy of the writ application upon the added respondent No. 5 within 7 days from today and file affidavit of service thereto showing actual service on the next date. Let the matter stand adjournment for 10 days and appear in the list on 4.4.2003 under the heading Special Fixed Listed Motion"". 3. Thereafter Shri Santanu Laha, respondent No. 5 was added as respondent in the writ petition. The respondent No. 5 is the natural father of the writ petitioner No. 2. From the affidavit-of-service affirmed by Shri Dilip Sadhu on 4.4,2003 it appears that the respondent No. 5 has been served with a notice dated 25.3.2003 issued by Smt. Sanghamitra Nandy, advocate for the writ petitioners alongwith a copy of the writ application. In spite of such service the respondent No. 5 chose not to appear and contest this proceeding. 4. The respondent No. 4 and the respondent No. 5 married each other and the marriage between the respondents No. 4 and 5 was solemnised according to Hindu rites and customs on 5.2.1996. Out of the wedlock of the respondents No. 4 and 5 the writ petitioner No. 2 Shri Subham Laha was born on 10.10.1998. Admittedly even now the writ petitioner No. 2 is a Hindu minor. Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 reads as follows: ""Natural Guardians of Hindu minor.--The natural guardians of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor's person as well as in respect of the minor's property (excluding his or her undivided interestSri Chandra Nath Sadhu And Ors. vs The State Of West Bengal And Ors. on 23 May, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/347050/ 1in joint family property), are- (a) In the case of a boy or unmarried girl--the father, and after him, the mother: provided that the custody of a minor who has not completed the age of five years shall ordinary be with the mother; (b) In the case of an illegitimate boy or an illegitimate unmarried girl--the mother, and after her, the father; (c) In the case of a married girl--the husband; provided that no person shall be entitled to act as the natural gurardian of a minor under the provisions of this section- (a) If he has ceased to be a Hindu, or (b) If he has completely and finally renounced the world by becoming a hermit (Vanaprastha) or an ascetic (yati or sanyasi)"" 5. Thus according to Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, in case of the writ petitioner No. 2, who is a Hindu minor boy, natural guardians are respondent No. 5, the natural father and after him the respondent No. 4, the natural mother. 6. Unfortunately the relationship between the respondents No. 4 and 5 had come to a stage that it was not at all possible for them to live together as husband and wife any more. The respondent No. 4 and the respondent No. 5 jointly presented a petition under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce by mutual consent. 7. Paragraph 9 of the aforesaid petition under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 reads as follows: ""That the petitioner and the co-petitioner both have resolved that the co-petitioner Smt. Sutapa Laha nee Sadhu shall be the natural guardian of her son Subham Laha. The co-petitioner Smt. Sutapa Laha nee Sadhu shall also be entitled to the custody of minor Subham Laha and also be entitled to do all acts for welfare and well being of Subham Laha."" 8. By an order No. 4 dated 13.12.2001 passed by the learned District Judge, Hooghly, in Mat Suit No. 300 of 2000 the marriage between respondents No. 4 and 5 was dissolved by a decree of divorce on consent. The aforesaid order No. 4 dated 13.12. 01 passed in Mat Suit No. 300 of 2000 reads as follows: ""Order No. 4 dated 13.12.2001: The application under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act is moved by the parties.

It is submitted by them that they are not in a position to reconcile and, therefore, they pray for dissolution of their marriage on consent. Upon consideration of the facts and circumstances and the evidence adduced by the parties, I am of the view that there has been an irretrievable break down of the marriage and for that the marriage should be dissolved by a decree of divorce on consent as prayed for. Hence, Ordered that the application under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act is allowed on consent.

In this writ proceeding this Court is not deciding the question of custody of the writ petitioner No. 2. 10. On 9th February, 2002 a Deed of Adoption was executed in the District Sub-registry Office at Hooghly and by the said Deed of Adoption the writ petitioner No. 1 claims to have become the adoptive father of the writ petitioner No. 2. The writ petitioner No. 1 and the respondent No. 4 are the brother and sister. Annexure-'P-3' of the writ application is a copy of the Deed of Adoption. It is evident from the said Deed of Adoption that respondent No. 5, the natural father was not a signatory in the said Deed of Adoption. There is nothing in the said Deed of Adoption to indicate that respondent No. 5, the natural father, consented or permitted to give the petitioner No. 2 in adoption. Section 9 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 lays down the provisions regarding persons capable of giving in adoption. Section 9 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 reads as follows: ""9.

202,"Bombay High Court Vijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate vs Neela Vijaykumar Bhate on 4 October, 2000 Equivalent citations: II (2001) DMC 64 Author: R Desai Bench: B Srikrishna, R Desai JUDGMENT Ranjana Desai, J. 1. By the impugned judgment and order dated 7th April, 1994, the III Family Court at Bombay has allowed M.J. Petition No. 382 of 1993, filed by the respondent-wife for dissolution of marriage under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and hence this appeal by the husband Vijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate (the original respondent). 2. Facts which give rise to the present appeal will have to be shortly stated : The appellant and the respondent were engaged, to be married on or about 21st May, 1973. According to the respondent, after the engagement she visited the appellant at Pune, where he was serving. She learnt that the respondent was friendly with one Sushilabai Atwe. Thereafter the respondent received some anonymous letters asking her not to marry the appellant. However, the respondent and her parents did not believe the letters and the respondent was married to the appellant on 10th June, 1973, at Bombay, according to Hindu vedic rites. 3. After the marriage, for about eight days the couple lived at Dombivli at the appellant's parent's house. Thereafter they went to Pune. The respondent stayed at Pune for about a month. During that period she found that the appellant was friendly with one Sushilabai Atwe. On account of this, the relations between the appellant and the respondent were strained. The respondent informed the appellant's father about it. Thereafter the respondent succeeded in persuading the appellant to leave the job at Pune. The appellant left the job and came to Bombay in July, 1973. The couple was living with the appellant's father at Dombivli. The appellant's relations with his sisters, brothers and other members of his family were not cordial. There used to be frequent quarrels between the appellant and his father. 4. After some days the appellant's parents asked the appellant and the respondent to live separately. Accordingly, they started living at Thane. Thereafter, the respondent went to her father for delivery, The respondent was not well. The appellant was also living there. He used to pick quarrels with the respondent and her parents. The appellant never used to return home in time. After the birth of their daughters, the couple purchased a flat near the respondent's parent's flat. During that period the respondent's parents looked after the children but the appellant never helped the respondent. 5. According to the respondent, the appellant had no friends. She, therefore, introduced him to her neighbour's son one Ramesh Sawant. The appellant was friendly with Ramesh. He and Ramesh used to see movies together. The appellant used to take advantage of the respondent's parents and yet he used to insult them and expect several things from them. He was never bothered about the respondent and her daughters' health. The appellant was a money minded person and this attitude of his caused mental torture to the respondent.Vijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate vs Neela Vijaykumar Bhate on 4 October, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/615143/ 16. The appellant suspected the respondent's character and alleged that she has illicit relations with the said Ramesh. The respondent used to treat the said Ramesh as a brother and hence she was shocked at this allegation. She however, stopped talking to Ramesh. Subsequently, appellant himself insisted that she should talk to Ramesh. 7. According to the respondent, the appellant used to insist on respondent's father consulting him in his financial matters. The appellant's stingy life-style, his nagging nature, and his lack of affection and care, affected the respondent's health. The respondent was advised to go out of Bombay for a change. On 6th April, 1982, she went to her uncle's house for a few days. The appellant followed the respondent though the respondent had told him not to do so. 8. The respondent shifted from there and went to her maternal uncle's place. The appellant followed her there as well. Everywhere he accused the respondent of having illicit relations with Ramesh Sawant. The appellant approached the respondent's relatives, friends and neighbours and made false accusations against the respondent. On some occasions the appellant forced the respondent to accompany him. The respondent apprehended danger to her life and, therefore, her father used to accompany her to the office. Instead of making any real efforts for reconciliation, the appellant was defaming the respondent. The efforts for reconciliation were made by Dr. Pethe and one Baburao Padhya. However, the appellant's adamant approach made reconciliation difficult. 9. The appellant wrote number of love letters to the respondent requesting her to join him but his behaviour was not consistent with the tone of the said leters. In the circumstances, the respondent filed the instant petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The respondent prayed for permanent custody of the daughters. We are, however, not concerned with the question of the custody of the daughters as admittedly the daughters are no longer minors. 10. The appellant opposed the petition. He denied that he had any illicit relations with Sushilabai Atwe; that he had any quarrels with the members of his family or with the respondent's parents. Generally, he denied all allegations of cruelty. According to him, the marital life of the couple was happly, he was a caring husband and he used to look after his daughters as well as his wife very well. He contended that without any rhyme or reason the respondent had left the matrimonial home. He had never quarrelled with the respondent's father over his money. He was not responsible for the respondent's illness. In fact, he had taken the respondent to various specialists. 11. After the respondent went to her uncle's place, he had written several letters to her and requested her to come back along with their daughters. The respondent did not allow the daughters to live with him. He was never informed about the whereabouts of the daughters. He had told the respondent's uncle to bring about reconciliation. In the meeting arranged for reconciliation respondent's relatives started quarrelling with him. All efforts at reconciliation were, therefore, frustrated. He denied that he had no friends He had kept his shares and debentures in the joint names of the respondent and his parents. Even after the respondent left the matrimonial home, he gave her cheque book by which she could withdraw the amount for the expenses of the children. According to the appellant the respondent had extra marital relations with Ramesh Sawant. Several averments about this alleged illicit relationship are found in the written statement dated 22nd August, 1983. It may be stated hereVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate vs Neela Vijaykumar Bhate on 4 October, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/615143/ 2that the allegations as regards illicit relations with Ramesh Sawant were subsequently withdrawn by the appellant, in that an application for amendment made by him to delete the said allegations was allowed. We shall advert to it a little later. 12. In support of her case the respondent examined herself and her father Shriram Keshav Natekar. The appellant examined himself. He also examined his mother Snehlata R. Bhate and his sister Aparna Vijay Bhagwat. After appreciating the evidence on record, the Family Court came to the conclusion that, by making reckless allegations against the character of the respondent, the appellant had committed acts of mental cruelty. The Family Court, therefore, passed a decree of divorce. The Family Court, however, was of the view that the other allegations which according to the respondent constituted cruelty do not amount to cruelty within the meaning of the Hindu Marriage Act, but were in the nature of ordinary wear and tear of married life. Therefore, in this appeal filed by the appellant-husband, basically, there is a challenge to the view taken by the Family Court that allegations made against the character of the respondent amount to cruelty. It is contended that since the allegations were allowed to be withdrawn no decree of divorce can rest on them. 13. It is not necessary to refer to the findings of the Family Court on the question of custody and access to the children and their maintenance as in view of the fact that the daughters have attained majority, the said questions do not survive now. But, for the completion of narration of facts, it may be stated here that the Family Court had granted permanent custody of minor daughter Rashmi to the respondent. The appellant was directed to pay to the respondent maintenance for Rashmi at the rate of Rs. 750/- per month from the date of the order. Since the other daughter Deepa had attained majority there was no question of her custody being .granted to either the appellant or the respondent. No maintenance was granted to Deepa as being a major she was not entitled to maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. 14. We have heard at some length Mr. V.A. Gangal with Mr. S.D. Balsara, learned Counsel for the petitioner and Mr. M.B. Badkar with Mr. Ajitkumar C. Shah learned Counsel for the respondent. With the assistance of the learned Counsel we have gone through the record. 15. On behalf of the appellant written submissions have also been filed in the Court. Mr. Gangal contended that the Trial Court erred in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had committed acts of cruelty. Allegations of cruelty are two fold : firstly, it is alleged that the appellant was money minded; that he did not take care of his children and he was of a quarrelsome and suspicious nature, He did not attend to his matrimonial duties and made false accusations against the respondent. Secondly, it is alleged that in his written statement the appellant had falsely alleged illicit relationship between the respondent and Ramesh Sawant, which casued mental cruelty to the respondent. 16. Mr. Gangal contended that on the aspect of the appellant's making false allegations about the adulterous relationship between the respondent and Ramesh Sawant, except her interested word there is nothing on record. The respondent has not examined a single independent witness in support of her case. The only witness she examined was her father, who was obviously interested inVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate vs Neela Vijaykumar Bhate on 4 October, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/615143/ 3",['13']

It is in her evidence, as P.W. 1, during the course of cross-examination, that she was a Christian by birth, whereas the husband was a Hindu. The trial Court found the marriage between the parties to be valid, but refused to grant maintenance on the ground that the husband has no source of income. When the matter was taken in revision, the Court below awarded a maintenance of Rs. 150/- per month to the wife upholding the finding regarding the validity of the marriage. Hence, the revision petition and the criminal petition by the husband. 3. In view of the admission that the wife was a Christian by birth, whereas the husband was a Hindu and the marriage between them took place as per Hindu rites, the question that arises for consideration is whether the marriage is a valid one for purposes of granting maintenance under section 125, Cr.P.C. 4. To decide the issue, it is 1st necessary to have a reference to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and the other Marriage Laws. Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus : ""2. Application of Act :- (1) This Act applies - (a) to any person who is a Hindu by religion .....; (b) xx xx xx xx (c) to any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion ......

(2) xx xx xx (3) The expression ""Hindu"" in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is nevertheless a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section."" 5. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act basically contemplates solemnisation of the marriage between two Hindus and prescribe certain conditions thereof for its validity. The said section reads as follows : ""5. Conditions for a Hindu Marriage :- A marriage may be solemnised between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely : (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party - (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children or; (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity or epilepsy. (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of 21 years and the bride the age of 18 years at the time of marriage; (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (vi) omitted by Act 2 of 1978."" 6. Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for the registration of Hindu marriages for purposes of proof of the same. 7. Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus : ""11. Void Marriages :- Any marriage solemnised after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, against the other party be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5.""A.A. Balasundaram vs A. Vijayakumari And Anr. on 12 September, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604131/ 2The section as seen provides for grant of a decree declaring the marriage to be null and void on an application made by either party thereto when the marriage is performed in contravention of any of the conditions specified in Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act i.e., living spouse, degrees of prohibited relationship and sapinda relationship respectively. 8. Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for grant of a decree of nullity of voidable marriages on any of the grounds mentioned thereof. It reads as follows : ""12. Voidable marriages :- (1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely :- (a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or (b) that the marriage is in contravention of the conditions specified in Clause (ii) of Section 5; or (c) that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required under Section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978, the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or by any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent; or (d) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner. (2) xx xx xx."" To sum up, as per Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriages performed in contravention of Clauses (i), (iv) and of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act are void, whereas under Section 12 of the said Act, for contravention of any of the conditions enumerated therein, the marriages are voidable. 9. There is nothing in Section 11 or Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act saying that the marriage between a Hindu and a Christian, if performed, is void or voidable. It is crucial to notice that neither Section 11 nor Section 12 of the said Act renders a marriage between a Hindu and a Christian void or voidable on the ground that the parties belong to two different religions. The provisions of the said Act, namely Sections 11 and 12, having been specific in rendering certain marriages void and voidable and being silent as regards the marriage between a Hindu and a Christian and there being no provision in the Act dealing with such a question, it cannot be held that such a marriage is either void or voidable. 10. It is apposite to notice at this stage that though the husband earlier filed O.P. No. 91/87 in the Sub-Court, Rajahmundry, for a declaration that the marriage is voidable, he withdrew the same and thus the lis in that regard is no more pending before the Civil Court.A.A.

Bhattacharjee, J. 1. A petition by the applicant-wife for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. dismissed by the trial court. has been decreed by this Court on appeal. The wife has now filed this application in this Court under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act for permanent alimony. In opposing this application, Mr. Bachawat, the learned Counsel for the husband/opposite party, has urged that this Court cannot entertain this application which is to be filed in the 'District Court' in accordance with the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Mr. Bachawat has submitted that the present application ought to have been filed in the City Civil Court which is the 'District Court' within the meaning of the Act, where the original petition for restitution of conjugal rights was presented in accordance with Section 19 of the Act. For better appreciation and facility of discussion, the relevant portions of Section 19 and Section 25 of the Act are reproduced hereinabove : -- ""19. Every petition under this Act shall be presented to the district court within local limits of whose ordinary civil jurisdiction - (i) the marriage was solemnized; (ii) the respondent at the time of presentation of the petition resides; or (iii) the parties to the marriage last resided; or..."" Section 25. (i) Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties, and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immoveable property of the respondent"". 2. Mr. Bachawat has urged that an application under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is nevertheless a ""petition under this Act"" within the meaning of Section 19 and must, therefore, be filed in the 'District Court' (here, the City Civil Court) under and in accordance with Section 19.Sm. Shyamali Sarkar vs Ashim Kumar Sarkar on 18 September, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/833996/ 13. The expressions ""application"" and ""petition"", though sometimes used indiscriminately to denote the samething, have different connotations also. An ""application"" for example, unless otherwise expressly provided, may even be oral, as would appear, for example, from the provisions of Article 134A of the Constitution, the provisions of Rule 11, Order 21 of the Civil P.C. and the catena of cases decided under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. But a ""petition"" must and cannot but be in writing. That these two expressions have different connotations, would also appear from the provisions of Section 2(a) & (b) of the Limitation Act of 1963; for otherwise, even as late as in 1963, those clauses would not have expressly defined the word ""application"" to include a ""petition"" and the word ""applicant"" to include a ""petitioner"". When a statutory definition defines ""A"" to include ""B"", then ordinarily, though not invariably, the implication is that ""A"" would not have, but for such definition, included ""B"". While recommending the insertion of these new definitions in the Limitation Act of 1963, the Law Commission in its Second Report on Limitation (S. 9, page 5) observed that ""the object is to provide a period of limitation for original petitions and applications under special laws"". These observations would also indicate that the word petition, when used in juxtaposition to the word application, would mean petitions of original nature, that is petitions which would initiate and found proceedings of original nature which are independent of and not consequential to any other proceedings. 4. The Hindu Marriage Act has provided for four substantive reliefs like restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, nullity of marriage and divorce and in Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B and 14 where it has provided for those substantive reliefs, it has also provided that the mode to invoke reliefs under those Sections would be by way of petition, But in Section 24 and 25, where the Act has provided for proceeding for pendente life and also permanent alimony, which can be initiated only as consequential to another original proceeding for any of the substantive reliefs under Sections 9 to 14 it has provided that the mode to invoke those Sections for such consequential reliefs would be by way of application. In Section 14 itself, while in Sub-section(1), word petition has been used with reference to substantive proceeding for dissolution of marriage, in the proviso to Sub-section (1) and in Sub-section(2) the word application has been used to provide for the mode to initiate the incidental proceeding to. obtain permission of the Court to present the substantive petition for dissolution of marriage before the expiry of one year since the date of the marriage. Now, when in respect of the same subject-matter, namely, matrimonial reliefs, different words like ""application"" and ""petition"" have been used in the same Statute, and even in the same Section of that Statute, then there may very well be a presumption that the Legislature, which is ordinarily presumed to use words precisely and not indiscriminately, has used the two different words to mean different things. When two different words are used in the same Statute, it may be presumed that those words, even if otherwise analogous, have been used with different connotations. Applying these rules of interpretation, it may be held that the expression ""petition"" in Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act would mean orginal petitions filed for any of the substantive reliefs awardable under Sections 9 to 13B of the Act and would not cover applications under Section 24 or 25, which can be filed only during the pendency or on the termination of a substantive proceeding under Sections 9 to 13B, as something incidental or consequential to such a proceeding. 5. But let us not go by the rules of interpretation alone. For, as pointed out by Chandrachud, J. (as his Lordship then was) in Union of India v. Sankalchand, , the principles of interpretation, withSm. Shyamali Sarkar vs Ashim Kumar Sarkar on 18 September, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/833996/ 2rules pulling in different directions, have become a murky area and just as the case-law digest can supply an authority on almost any thinkable proposition, so also these principles have collected over the years divergent formulae which can fit in with any interpretation which one may choose to place"". To quote from Lord Denning (Discipline of Law -- 1979 -- page 9), ""if you find a maxim or rule on your side, your opponent will find one on his side to counteract it"". We would accordingly find in any standard treatise on the subject some other rules also to the effect that the Legislature may use two different expressions without intending to make any distinction and, as pointed out by the Privy Council in Ramdas Vithaldas v. Amerchand, ILR 40 Bom 630 at p. 638 : (AIR 1916 PC at P. 9), the rule that two different words in the same context should mean two different things may ha ve to be negatived in a case where the ""draughtsman was not very careful in his use of language"". Indeed a reference toS. 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act would show that the draftsman was really careless, for that Section provides for custody of children consequential to a decree in a substantive proceeding and, therefore, according to the analysis made hereinbefore based on rules of interpretation, the Section should have provided for an application as the mode to invoke such consequential relief. But the Section, for reasons difficult to appreciate, has used the expression ""application by petition"", copying the same blindly from Section 42 of the Divorce Act, 1869 (which was also similarly copied in Section 38 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954) forgetting altogether that the Indian Divorce Act having provided for suits (and not petitions) for substantive matrimonial relief, its providing for application by petition for consequential relief could have created no confusion. 6. I am, however, satisfied that even without the aid of these ambivalent rules of interpretation, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act would on a proper construction of its express terms, clearly indicate that the Section having provided for some relief which is incidental or consequential to the substantive relief awardable under the Act, can and is to be invoked in the court which has granted that substantive relief. Under the express terms of Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, extracted at the outset, ""any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act"" can order payment of permanent alimony and there should not be the slightest doubt that a Court hearing appeals under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act and thus granting or refusing, by way of confirmation or otherwise, the various reliefs awardable under the Act, is obviously exercising jurisdiction under this Act. It is true that, as pointed out by Mr. Bachawat, under Section 19 of the Act, only the District Court hats been conferred jurisdiction to entertain petitions under the Act. But while the district courts have thus been exclusively granted the initial jurisdiction in respect of these petitions under the Hindu Marriage Act. the appellate courts, while hearing appeals from the decisions of the district courts, and affirming, modifying or reversing those decisions, would also be exercising jurisdiction under the Hindu Marriage Act. If, as pointed out by Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee in Gurdeo Singh v. Chandrika Singh, (1909) ILR 36 Cal 193 at P. 206, the expression jurisdiction means ""the power or the authority of a court to hear and determine a cause, to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power in relation to it"", then there cannot be an iota of doubt that the appellate courts in hearing appeals under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and in affirming or reversing the decrees granting or refusing reliefs under the Act, exercise jurisdiction under that Act. It would, in my view, amount almost to a contradiction in terms to say that the appellate Court has granted a decree under the Hindu Marriage Act, but yet has not exercised any jurisdiction thereunder.Sm.

205,"Madras High Court C.G. Rangabashyam vs Ranjani Murugan And Ors. on 25 February, 1980 Bench: A Varadarajan ORDER 1. This criminal miscellaneous petition has been filed under S. 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the third accused in C.C. No. 1417 of 1979 on the file on the IV Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Madras for calling for the records in that case and quashing the proceedings in so far as they relate to the petitioner. According to the private complaint, the petitioner - a Member of the Board of Revenue, Government of Tamil Nadu is the husband of the respondent - second accused. The first respondent in this petition is the complainant. The second respondent is the first accused in the complaint. The fourth respondent is the fourth accused in the complaint. According to the private complaint, the complainant Ranjini Murugan is the lawfully wedded wife of the first accused M. Murugan they having been married on 10th May, 1957, and they have three daughters and a son. The third accused is the husband of the second accused. In view of the wealth and high social status of the first accused and the complainant, accused 2 and 3 and many other couples known to them were in the habit of making social visits to the house of the complainant and the first accused. The second accused became a member of the Hypnotic Circle, Madras, propagating Hypnotism as an Art and Science of which the first accused is the President. In course of time, illicit intimacy developed between accused 1 and 2 with the consent and connivance of the third accused. The first accused used to visit the house of the accused 2 and 3 at No. 3, Thiruveedhi Amman Koil Street, Madras 28 and he was welcomed and encouraged by the accused 2 and 3 to spend his time in their house. In or about January, 1978, accused 1 to 3 entered into a criminal conspiracy for the first accused marrying the second accused. In order to facilitate the same, the first accused began to pressurise the complainant to give him a divorce. But, when she refused to comply with that demand, he began to pressurise her to give her consent to marry the second accused. The complainant understand that in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy entered into by the accused 1 to 3, the first accused married the second accused in Ranganathaswami Temple, Tiruneermalai, Madras-44 on 26th March, 1978. The first accused was spending most of his time in the company of the second accused from October, 1978 and he has been continuously residing in the house of the accused 2 and 3 where the third accused also continues to live. In order to save embarrassment to accused 1 and 2, the third accused consented to the second accused filing a petition for divorce against him on 17th July, 1978 falsely alleging that the third accused had deserted her since 1967. The third accused admitted that allegation in that proceeding even though it was untrue and both the accused 2 and 3 were living together even at the time of filing of that petition for divorce and a decree for divorce was passed on 19th August, 1978. From the aforesaid facts and circumstances it is clear that the accused 1 to 3 entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit the offence of bigamy and they are liable under Sections 120-B and 494 of the I.P.C., and S. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It is in these terms that the complainant filed a private complaint for the issue of summons to the accused and prosecuting them for the offence of criminal conspiracy and bigamy. 2. In this petition for quashing the proceedings in the criminal case so far as the petitioner third accused is concerned two points have been raised and they are : (1) that the allegations made in the petition do not constitute an offence punishable under S. 494, I.P.C. and therefore, there could be noC.G. Rangabashyam vs Ranjani Murugan And Ors. on 25 February, 1980 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81658/ 1criminal conspiracy for the commission of that offence and (2) that admittedly the second accused was the legally wedded wife of the third accused at the time of the alleged second marriage of the first accused with the second accused and therefore there was valid marriage between the accused 1 and 2 which would become invalid in view of Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and therefore the alleged marriage between the accused 1 and 2 is not a bigamous marriage. In P. V. Raddy v. State . The High Court dismissed an application under Section 484, Cr.P.C. of 1973 holding that the inherent powers possessed by it under that section can be invoked and exercised only when the facts alleged in the complaint if they are accepted to be correct at their face value, do not make out an offence with which the accused is charged. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court have upheld the view of the High Court observing :- ""It is now well settled that the High Court does not ordinarily interfere at an interlocutory stage of a criminal proceedings pending in a Subordinate Court. Bearing in mind the well recognised principles of law governing the matter and taking into consideration the nature of the impugned order, we think the High Court was right in declining to grant relief to the appellants. It is also not a matter in which we may legitimately interfere in exercise of our extraordinary powers under Art. 136 of the Constitution specially when the case is at its threshold and evidence has still to be adduced as to whether the minerals extracted could or could not be used as major mineral for certain purposes. It must be realised that it is not possible to determine the difficult question of the kind involved in the instant case purely in abstract without relevant evidence bearing on the matter in issue. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal."" In the light of that decision, it is necessary to see whether the allegations made in the complaint in the present case do not constitute the offence of bigamy. The alleged conspiracy cannot stand by itself and has to stand or fall with the case of the complainant that the offence of bigamy has been committed by the accused 1 and 2 in the case. In the complain clear allegation is made about the alleged conspiracy between all the three accused, for, it is stated in paragraph 5 that in or about January, 1978, the accused 1 to 3 entered into a criminal conspiracy that the first accused should marry the second accused and commit an illegal act, and in paragraph 6 of the complaint it is alleged that in pursuance of that criminal conspiracy, entered into by the accused 1 to 3, the first accused married the second accused at Sri Ranganathaswami Temple, Tiruneermalai, Madras-44 on 26th March, 1978. The complaint contains allegations as to what happened prior to and after the alleged conspiracy between the accused 1 to 3. About what happened prior to the conspiracy, it is alleged into complaint that the accused 2 and 3 who are husband and wife were in the habit of making social visits to the house of the complainant and the first accused, that the second accused became a Member of the Hypnotic Circle, Madras, of which the first accused is the President, that in the course of time illicit intimacy developed between the accused 1 and 2 with the consent and connivance of the third accused, and that the first accused used to visit the house of the accused 2 and 3 at No. 3, Thiruveethiamman Koil Street, Madras-28, where he was welcomed and encourged by the accused 2 and 3 to spend his time. About what happened after the conspiracy and the alleged marriage between the accused 1 and 2 on 26th February, 1978, what is stated in the complaint is that the first accused was spending most of his time in the company of the second accused from October, 1978 by continuously living in the house where the accused 2 and 3 were living, namely, No. 3, Thiruveethiamman Koil Street, Madras-28 that in order to save embarrassment to the first and theC.G.

T. Vanamamalai, the learned counsel for the petitioner in this case and it was asked whether it will not be difficult to say, in the face of these allegations that the complaint does not contain allegation from which the offence of criminal conspiracy could be inferred if the necessary evidence is adduced, the learned counsel for the petitioner did not seriously submit that the allegations do not constitute a case of conspiracy, and bigamy provided, the alleged marriage between the accused 1 and 2 is valid in law. I find that the allegations in the complaint would constitute the offences of conspiracy and bigamy provided that the alleged marriage between accused 1 and 2 is valid in law but for S. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the alleged marriage between the first accused, the husband of the complainant, and the second accused, who, according to the complaint, was the legally wedded wife of the petitioner herein at the time of the alleged marriage is invalid in law and therefore there is no question of that marriage becoming void by reason of S. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The learned counsel invited my attention to paragraph 431 of Mullah's Hindu Law where it is stated that ""A woman cannot marry another man while her husband is alive, except where her marriage has been dissolved by divorce."" The learned counsel invited my attention also to paragraphs 34 and 66 at pages 33 and 63 of N. R. Raghavachariar's Hindu Law Seventh Edition. In paragraph 34 it is stated :- ""Though monogamy is recommended by the text a Hindu can marry any number of wives even during the lifetime of one or more wives, the rules of Hindu Law laying down the conditions for taking a second wife being held as not mandatory but only as directory. But single-husbandedness is the lot prescribed for a woman under Hindu Law which does not countenance polyandry, and hence a second marriage for the woman during the lifetime of her first husband is invalid unless there has previously been a valid divorce in accordance with the custom, if any, of the caste to which the parties belong."" In paragraph 66 we find the following passage :- ""A review of the authorities on the question of custom sanctioning remarriage of a woman during the lifetime of the first husband leads to the following position, a custom by which a woman can marry again during the lifetime of the first husband without the first marriage being annulled by divorce or in some manner recognised by caste usage as equivalent to divorce, as for instance by abandonment by the first husband, the mere wish of the woman against that of the husband being insufficient for this purpose, is void as an immoral one, because if a wife could leave her husband whenever she pleased and without any forms or justification whatever, the marriage tie to which ordinarily a special sanctity is lent by the Hindu religion and sentiment, will have absolutely no force at all, and the intercourse of the sexes, in a caste in which such a state of society was allowed, would reduce its members to the level of the beasts of the field to the standing disgrace and mortification ofC.G.

Appeal under Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short ""the Code"") against the order dated 27-7-1998 passed by IXth Additional District Judge, Indore in Hindu Marriage Case No. 258 of 1998 granting an injunction against the appellant/wife restraining her not to enter forcibly into the house of the respondent/husband. 2. The facts giving rise to this appeal are that the respondent/husband filed a divorce petition under Section 13(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act against the appellant/wife on the ground of cruelty. Alongwith this petition, respondent/husband has also filed an application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code praying therein that appellant/wife be restrained not to forcibly enter into the house of the respondent/husband because the appellant/wife has threatened to the respondent/husband to commit suicide and the submission of the husband in the application was that on 28th March, 1998 she has finally left the house of the respondent/husband along with all her silver and gold ornaments in the absence of the respondent without his knowledge and since then she is residing alongwith her brother and the respondent is apprehending that the wife may come again in the house of the husband and may create some problem and also commit suicide and may involve the husband in some criminal case, therefore, she be restrained not to forcibly enter into the house of the husband. This application was heard by the Trial Court and by impugned order dated 27-7-1998 allowed the same and granted an injunction against the appellant/wife. This application was objected by the wife before the Trial Court and it was submitted that no such injunction can be granted as there is no provision under the Hindu Marriage Act for grant of such injunction but the Trial Court after considering the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties granted an injunction exercising inherent powers under Section 151 of the Code, against which appellant/wife has filed this Misc. Appeal. 3. I have heard Shri S.K. Pawnekar, learned counsel for appellant/ wife; Miss. Achla Joshi with Shri R.C. Mehra, learned counsels for respondent/ husband: and perused the record. 4. The submission of Shri S.K. Pawnekar, learned counsel for the appellant/wife is that there is no provision in the Hindu Marriage Act for grant of injunction. The only reliefs that are available under the Act are restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, a decree of divorce, and a decree of nullity can be granted but no declaratory relief or a relief of injunction can be granted and the Court has also no jurisdiction either to consider the prayer of an injunction of such a nature. In support of his submissions he cited the decisions in the case of Umashankar Prasad Singh v. Radha Devi and Ors., reported in AIR 1967 Patna 220; in the case of Trilokchand Modi and Anr. v. Om Prakash Jaiswal, reported in AIR 1974 Patna 335; and in the case of Parwati Devi v. Harbindra Singh,Pratiksha vs Pravin on 9 October, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/996224/ 1reported in AIR 1980 Rajasthan 249, in which it has been held that there is no provision in the Hindu Marriage Act for granting an injunction against the other party restraining him or her from contracting a marriage with another person and also there is no provision in the Act for filing a suit for permanent injunction. Therefore, it is not permissible for any Court to grant any such temporary injunction in such suits. 5. In reply the submission of Miss. Achla Joshi and Shri R.C. Mehra, learned counsels for respondent/husband is that by virtue of provisions of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, are applicable to the petitions under the Hindu Marriage Act and all the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act shall be regulated as far as may be by the Code of Civil Procedure. Her further submission is that in view of the provisions of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the injunction application under Section 151 of the Code is tenable before the Court hearing the petition and the Court can exercise the powers for grant of injunction. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for respondent/husband that if the provisions of Rules 1 and 2 of Order XXXIX of the Code would not be applicable, then under Section 151 of the Code the Court hearing and deciding the petition under the Hindu Marriage Act having inherent powers to grant relief of injunction or to pass such orders or as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court and under the inherent powers Court may grant general or other relief which it may think just and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case. It is further submitted that the Trial Court has rightly allowed the injunction application under the facts and circumstances of the case exercising the inherent powers under Section 151 of the Code and, therefore, the impugned order is perfectly legal and needs no interference by this Court in this appeal. In support of her submissions, she relied upon the decision in the case of Braj Kishore Sinha and Anr. v. Rekha Sinha, reported in I (1992) DMC 331; and also on Full Bench decision of Patna High Court in the case of Bajrang Rai and Ors. v. Ismail Mian and Ors., reported in AIR 1978 Patna 339; and Division Bench decision in the case of Chitra Sengupta v. Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, reported in AIR 1988 Calcutta 98; and also in the case of Anita Karmokar and Anr. v. Birendra Chandra Karmokar, reported in AIR 1962 Calcutta 88. 6. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and considering the rival and forceful submissions, I am of the view that the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure have been by virtue of Section 21 made applicable to different types of petitions under the Act, whether, for example, it be a petition for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9; or a petition for alimony under Section 25 of the Act; or for a petition for a decree of nullity under Sections 11 and 12 (where the marriage is void or voidable), the Court by virtue of Section 21 is not powerless or precluded to issue temporary injunctions in these proceedings. Perpetual injunctions are granted under Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the temporary injunctions are granted under the Code of Civil Procedure. Under Sub-section (1) of Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in his favour whether expressly or by implication. The obligation means and includes every duty enforceable by law. The word ""obligation"" defined under Section 2(a) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 means and includes every duty enforceable by law. As has been held that the word ""obligation"" is not used in the Act in a limited or restricted sense thus the conjugal obligations are also not excluded from the scope of preventive injunction. Therefore, injunction can be issued to restrain a HinduPratiksha vs Pravin on 9 October, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/996224/ 2husband or wife from contracting a second marriage during the subsistence of the first. Any kind of breach about legal obligation to affect right of marriage can be covered in the wide importance of the word ""obligation"" and in the circumstances of the case an injunction can be issued against spouse regarding breach of conjugal or matrimonial obligations and they may be said to be covered within the aforesaid scope of Section 38(1) of the Specific Relief Act under which a perpetual injunction may be granted in favour of the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in his favour, whether expressly or by implication. The Hindu Marriage Act does not expressly create any bar about seeking the preventive relief of injunction in the proceedings filed under the Hindu Marriage Act. Therefore, in a petition filed under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act as well as a suit filed under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the proceedings in both the cases being of civil nature, its cognizance is not expressly or impliedly barred by any provisions under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Court which is taking the cognizance in the matter is primarily a Civil Court which is sufficiently vested with the inherent powers. Therefore, the jurisdiction cannot be treated as excluded. 7. The object of issue of temporary injunction is to prefer status-quo so that the party in whose favour a decision is ultimately given by the Court is not deprived of his benefit. For granting temporary injunction it is not necessary that relief of perpetual injunction must always be asked for. It, therefore, follows that simply because there is no provision under the Act for granting permanent injunction, the Court is powerless to issue temporary injunctions in any other case under the Act. To issue a temporary injunction it is necessary that the case should fall strictly within the provisions of Rules 1 and 2 of Order XXXIX of the Code and under those rules the injunction can only be issued when there is a threat to any property in dispute or the same is in danger or being wasted. Therefore, the element of property is a must in both the cases. Therefore, from the plain reading of the aforesaid provisions it may be clear that strictly injunction may not be granted under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code in matrimonial disputes covered by the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act but certainly by virtue of provisions of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, temporary injunction can be granted in exercise of its inherent powers which are not to be conferred by statute in the Court. This power relate to the procedure to be followed by the Courts in deciding cases before it. 8. Section 151 of the Code provides as under:-- ""151. Saving of inherent powers of Court-- Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice, or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court."" 9. Section 151 of the Code is not a substantive provision conferring any right to get any relief of any kind. The object of the Legislature in enacting the various provisions of laws of procedure is also to serve the ends of justice. This section provides recognition of an age-old well established principle that every Court has inherent powers to act ex debito justitiue to do that real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone it exists or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. It has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Jaipur Mineral Development Syndicate, Jaipur v. The Commr. of L-T., New Delhi, reported in AIR 1977 SC 1348, that ""Every Court is constituted for thePratiksha vs Pravin on 9 October, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/996224/ 3","['15', '9', '13', '21', '2','25']"

Brijesh Kumar Gupta; applicant before this Court, has filed the present Transfer Application under Sections 23(3) and 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Section 21A(b) of Hindu Marriage Act, praying for transferring Divorce Petition No. 367 of 2001, Smt. Poonam Gupta v. Brijesh Gupta, under Sections 13 and 27, Hindu Marriage Act pending in the Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Meerut to the Court of VIIth Additional District Judge, Gwalior, where Matrimonial Petition No. 2A of 2000, Brijesh Kumar Gupta v. Smt Poonam Gupta, under Section 12. Hindu Marriage Act (to declare the marriage between the parties as void) is said to be already pending since before the filing of the aforementioned divorce petition by the wife at Meerut. 2. In para 10 of the affidavit, filed in support of the transfer application, the applicant, Brijesh Kumar Gupta has admitted that he had received notice of the said Matrimonial Divorce Petition No. 367 of 2001 (Annexure-2 to the affidavit) to appear in the case on July 30, 2001 when an attempt for reconciliation was made before the Family Court, Meerut. He also admitted that Family Court, Meerut, fixed 5.7.2002 vide its order dated 14.5.2002 and that the said Court has rejected his application for stay of the proceedings not finding favour with the prayer made by the said applicant (the husband) vide application (paper No. 18Ga) for transferring the matrimonial divorce petition at Meerut to Gwalior. 3. From the facts as stated in the affidavit in support of the transfer application, it is evident that husband-applicant has already submitted to the transfer of the Family Court, Meerut. by joining proceedings. 4. Heard learned counsel for the husband-applicant, Sri Vijay Prakash, Advocate at length and perused the record. 5. The learned counsel for the husband-applicant contends that the court below (Family Court, Meerut) has committed illegality in rejecting application filed by the husband applicant for transferring Divorce Petition No. 367 of 2001 to the Court at Gwalior where Matrimony Petition No. 2A of 2000 (Annexure-1 to the affidavit), filed earlier in point of time, is already pending. 6. Copy of the application (Paper No. 18Ga) dated 14.5.2002 has been filed as Annexure-4 to the affidavit wherein the prayer is to the effect that proceedings of Matrimonial Petition No. 367 of 2001, Smt. Poonam Gupta D. Brijesh Kumar Gupta, be stayed and transferred to the Court of VIIth Additional District Judge, Gwalior, so that both the cases may be heard together. 7. By means of the order dated 31.5.2002, the Family Court, Meerut, has held, while rejecting the said application (18Ga), that the said Court was not competent to transfer the case as prayed and itBrijesh Kumar Gupta vs Smt. Poonam Gupta on 17 July, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1039973/ 1was open for the said husband (opposite party in the Meerut case) to seek desired relief by approaching the Hon'ble High Court, Allahabad/Hon'ble Supreme Court for the desired relief. 8. The learned counsel for the husband-applicant, in support of his prayer in the transfer application, referred to the provision of Section 21A Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (as amended up to date) called the Act. Section 21A of the Act is being reproduced : ""21A. (1) Where : (a) a petition under this Act has been presented to a District Court having jurisdiction by a party to a marriage praying for a decree for judicial separation under Section 10 or a decree of divorce under Section 13 ; and (b) another petition under this Act has been presented thereafter by the other party to the marriage praying for a decree for judicial separation under Section 10 or for a decree of divorce under Section 13 on any ground, whether in the same District Court or in a different District Court, in the same State or in a different State, the petitions shall be dealt with as specified in Sub-section (2). (2) in a case where Subsection (1) applies : (a) if the petitions are presented to the same District Court, both the petitions shall be tried and heard together by that District Court ; (b) If the petitions are presented to different District Courts, the petition presented later shall be transferred to the District Court in which the earlier petition was presented and both the petitions shall be heard and disposed of together by the District Court in which the earlier petition was presented. (3) in a case where Clause (b) of Sub-section (2) applies, the Court or the Government as the case may be, competent under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), to transfer any suit or proceeding from the District Court in which the later petition has been presented to the District Court in which the earlier petition is pending, shall exercise its powers to transfer such later petition as if it had been empowered so to do under the said Code."" 9. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that since a petition (for declaring marriage between parties void) has been presented prior in time at Gwalior under Section 12, Hindu Marriage Act, the subsequent Matrimonial Divorce petition at Meerut filed by the wife could not proceed and it was incumbent upon the Meerut Court to stay proceedings before it and transfer the said petition to Gwalior. In support of the above argument, he has referred to the expression 'where in the same State or in a different State'. According to the learned counsel for the applicant, Section 21A of theBrijesh Kumar Gupta vs Smt. Poonam Gupta on 17 July, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1039973/ 2Act provides where conditions contemplated under Subsection (1) Clauses (a) and (b) are fulfilled and in that situation, according to him, the petitions have to be dealt with as specified in Sub-section (2) and since all the conditions contained under Section 21A(1) Clauses (a) and (b) of the Act are specified in the present case, the court below had no choice/option but to resort to Sub-section (2) of Section 21A of the Act. Referring to Sub-section (2) he referred to Clause (b) and Sub-section (3) of Section 21A of the Act, it is argued that under Sub-section (3) of Section 21A, Meerut Court should have transferred the case before it to the Gwalior Court. 10. Learned counsel for the husband-applicant, further referred to Sections 22 and 23, Code of Civil Procedure which are reproduced : ""22. Where a suit may be instituted in any one of two or more Courts and is instituted in one of such Courts, any defendant, after notice to the other parties, may, at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues are settled at or before such settlement, apply to have the suit transferred to another Court, and the Court to which such application is made, after considering the objections of the other parties (if any), shall determine in which of the several Courts having jurisdiction the suit shall proceed."" ""23. (1) Where the several Courts having jurisdiction are subordinate to the same appellate court, an application under Section 22 shall be made to the appellate court. (2) Where such Courts are subordinate to different appellate courts but to the same High Court, the application shall be made to the said High Court. (3) Where such Courts are subordinate to different High Courts, the application shall be made to the High Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the Court in which the suit is brought is situate. 11. A bare reading of Sections 22 and 23, Code of Civil Procedure, go to show that these provisions deal with an entirely different contingency. Section 23 is complementary provision to Section 22, Code of Civil Procedure, as is evident from the reading of Sub-section (1) of Section 23. Further Sections 22 and 23, Code of Civil Procedure, come into play only in a situation when a suit may be instituted in any one of two or more Courts and is instituted in one of such Courts, then Section 22 confers a right upon any defendant to file an application (in the Court specified under Section 23 Code of Civil Procedure) to have the suit transferred to some such another Court, subject to fulfilment of other conditions contained under Section 22 i.e., said application is being filed at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues are settled at or before such settlement. If such an application is being filed by the defendant, the Court may, after considering the objections of the other parties, if any, shall determine in which of the several Courts having jurisdiction, the suit shall proceed; if at all be transferred from that Court to another Court (considering the attending circumstances of a particular case). 12.

Heard Sri A.T. Kulshrestha, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri V.K. Goel and Sri S.R. Verma appearing for the respondents. 2. By this writ petition the petitioner has prayed for quashing the order dated 27.11.2004 passed by the District Judge, Mathura allowing the Civil Revision filed by respondent No. 3 against the order dated 7.5.2004 passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) allowing an application filed by the petitioner under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act for interim mandamus and litigation expenses. A petition for divorce has been filed by the respondent No. 3 against the petitioner which is registered as Marriage Petition No. 653 of 2002 Shiv Kumar Gautam v. Smt. Puja. The petitioner Smt. Puja filed an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act for the grant of interim maintenance and expenses for litigation. Learned Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) by an order dated 7.5.2004 allowed the application of the petitioner under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and directed for for payment of maintenance at the rate of Rs. 2200/- per month and Rs. 5000/- as litigation expenses and Rs. 150/- as expenses for attending the date in the case. Against the order dated 7.5.2004 passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) a civil revision has been filed by the respondent No. 3 which revision has been allowed by the impugned judgment dated 27.112.2004. The revisional court by the impugned judgment set aside the order of the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) and directed the learned Additional Civil Judge to decide the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act afresh. The revisional court while allowing the revision held that the learned Additional Civil Judge without recording any finding regarding income of the respondent No. 3 has directed for payment of maintenance which judgment is perverse and cannot be sustained. 3. One of the questions which have arisen in the writ petition is as to whether the revision filed by the respondent No. 3 against an order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was maintainable under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure or not. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the revision filed by the respondent No. 3 was not maintainable under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure hence the order is liable to be set aside. It is contended that the power of revision after the amendment made in the Code of Civil Procedure with effect from 1st July, 2002 can only be exercised by the High Court and the district court has no jurisdiction to exercise any revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Sri Kulshrestha further contended that the proceedings under Section 24 of the Act is not the original proceedings hence the power under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be exercised. Lastly it has been contended that the order of interim maintenance passed under Section 24 of the Act is only interlocutory order and no revision lie against any interlocutory order. Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the judgments, namely, 1980 A.W.C. 45 Smt. Madhvi Sirothia v.Smt.

Goel, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 has submitted that the revision was fully entertainable by the learned District Judge in view of the U.P. amendment made in Code of Civil Procedure by U.P. Act No. XIV of 2003. He contended that the power of revision has rightly been exorcised by the District Judge. Reliance has been placed by Sri Goel on the judgment of Karnataka High Court A.I.R. 1981 KARNATAKA 115 Smt. Subhasini v. B.R. Umakanth; A.I.R. 1982 ANDHRA PRADESH 109 Narendra Kumar Mehta v. Smt. Suraj Mehta. 5. Sri V.K. Goel further contended that the revisional court has rightly interfered with the order of the Civil Judge since without recording any findings with regard to income of the respondent No. 3 order for paying interim maintenance was passed. 6. I have considered the submissions of counsel for the parties and have perused the record. 7. Application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 has been allowed by the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division ) by order dated 7.5.2004 directing for payment of interim maintenance and litigation expenses. Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides :- ""21.

Section 28 of the Act as amended by the Act No. 68 of 1976 provides for appeal from decrees and orders. Section 28(2) provides that the orders made by the court in any proceeding under the Act under Section 25 or 26 shall be appealable if they are not interim orders. From the provisions of Section 28 of the Act as amended by Act No. 69 of 1976 it is clear that the orders passed under Section 24 are not appealable under Section 28. 9.

Explanation II,____________ The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to orders passed, before or after the commencement of this section, in original suits or other proceedings instituted before such commencement."" 10. The first submission of the petitioner's counsel is that on the strength of Section 115 as amended by Act No. 46 of 1999 the power of revision can be exercised only by the High Court. It is true that by Act No. 46 of 1999 Section 115 has been amended which gives jurisdiction to the High Court to call for record of any case which was decided by any court subordinate to such High Court.

209,"Madras High Court Maharaja Nadar vs Muthukani Ammal on 5 December, 1985 Equivalent citations: AIR 1986 Mad 346 Bench: Swamikkannu JUDGMENT 1. This is a second appeal preferred against the judgment and decree dated 30-1-1979 of the learned II Additional Subordinate Judge, Tirunelveli, in A. S. No. 147 of 1978. 2. The defendant, Maharaja Nadar in the suit is the appellant herein. - 3. The plaintiff, Muthukani Animal filed the suit for maintenance. Her case is as follows : - The marriage of the plaintiff with the defendant was celebrated about 11 years prior to the institution of the suit, in the father's house of the plaintiff at Sivahthipuram, as per the caste custom and usage of the community to which they belong. Since the date of marriage, they lived happily as husband and wife. The defendant was often beating the plaintiff and was cruelly treating her and was driving her out of his house. In spite of it, the plaintiff was bearing all the cruel treatment of her husband and was living as dutiful wife. At one time, the plaintiff was charged with the commission of offence of, theft. The defendant demanded the plaintiffs consent for the second marriage since they have no child. On her refusal, she was beaten and treated with cruelty. At last, the end of 1151 Andu, Adi month, the defendant beat the plaintiff and drove her from his house. He also threatened that in case she returned to his house, she would have to face dire consequences. The plaintiff apprehends that if she joins her husband, her life would be in danger. While so, in the month of Avani, the defendant married one Bommiammal, daughter of Manganatha Nadar as his second wife and they are living as husband and wife. The said marriage is invalid under law. While the marriage of the plaintiff and the defendant is subsisting, the defendant has no right to marry a second wife. Therefore, the defendant is bound to pay maintenance to the plaintiff. So notice was issued to the defendant. At the time of notice, the plaintiff was not aware of the income of the defendant. Therefore, she had, claimed only a sum of Rs. 100/- per mensem towards maintenance. Now the plaintiff learnt that the defendant is having three mike sets and is earning. He is also doing agricultural work and earning Rs. 1,000/- per month. The defendant is also doing money lending business. Considering the status of the parties and also the present cost of living, the plaintiff is entitled to a sum of Rs. 150/- per month towards her maintenance. The plaintiff is also entitled to past maintenance of Rs. 400/- with a charge upon the schedule mentioned property from the defendant. 4. The defendant raised the following contentions : - The marriage of the defendant and the plaintiff took place about 11 years ago, as per the Hindu rites, custom and usage. Since marriage they were living as husband and wife. It is false to allege that the defendant illtreated the plaintiff and drove her away to her father's house. It is also false to allege that the plaintiffs father often used to bring back the plaintiff and leave 'her in the defendant's house. The defendant never illtreated the plaintiff and there is no necessity for the same. The Plaintiff was very affectionate with the defendant and she was living with him happily. It is false toMaharaja Nadar vs Muthukani Ammal on 5 December, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/219392/ 1state that the plaintiff was charged with a commission of offence of theft. It is also false to allege that since the plaintiff and the defendant have no issues, the defendant asked for the plaintiff/respondent's consent for the second marriage. Since the plaintiff and the defendant loved each other, they got married. Without any other go, the plaintiffs father had to celebrate the marriage. Taking advantage of the love and affection of the defendant with his wife, the plaintiffs father started to blackmail the defendant and he often came and took the plaintiff to his house without the consent and permission of the defendant. On certain occasions, the defendant used to go to the house of the plaintiff's father to take her back. At last, at the beginning of Sept.1976 the plaintiff s father came and took away the plaintiff with the jewels worth about Rs. 7,000/- which were presented by the defendant out of love and affection. When the defendant asked the plaintiff to return to his house, the plaintiffs father refused to send her along with him. The defendant never ill-treated the plaintiff with cruelty and he never demanded the plaintiff to give her consent for the second marriage. The allegation that the defendant married one Bommi Ammal is false. The defendant did not marry Bommi Ammal. Even now the defendant is ready and willing to live with the plaintiff. The defendant is not entitled to the schedule mentioned properties absolutely. Excepting his agricultural income, he had no other business as mentioned in the plaint. The allegation that the defendant has got three mike sets for his business is denied. The defendant is getting only a sum of Rs. 75/-per. month towards his share of the income from the agricultural lands. He is not getting a huge income of Rs. 1,000/- per month, as alleged. Since the defendant is not getting any income more than Rs. 150//-, he is not in a position to pay Rs. 150/- to the plaintiff towards her maintenance. If at all she is entitled to any maintenance, she would be entitled to Rs. 25/- per mensem considering the status and income of the defendant. The suit has been filed at the instigation of the plaintiffs father. The defendant asked the plaintiff's father to return the plaintiff to, him on several times and issued notice and also through several persons. The plaintiff has not chosen to come and live with her husband. Therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to any maintenance. 5. On the above pleadings, the learned District Munsif framed necessary issues and decreed the suit awarding maintenance at the rate of Rs.50/- per month from the date of plaint till her life-time and also awarding Rs. 200/- towards her past maintenance, creating a charge over the 1/4th share of the defendant on items 1 to 12 alone. Aggrieved: by the decision of the trial Court, the defendant preferred A. S. No. 147 of 1978 before the lower appellate Court. The' following points were framed for consideration in the appeal before the lower appellate Court: ""(1) Whether the cruelty and desertion alleged by the respondent herein i.e., the plaintiff in the suit are true? (2) Whether the respondent herein is entitled to maintenance? If so, what is the quantum of maintenance?"" 6. The lower appellate Court held that it is clear from the evidence of P. Ws. 1 to 3 that the second marriage alleged by the plaintiff/respondent herein is not proved, and there is no positive proof. to show that the defendant/appellant herein has married the said Bommi Ammal as his second wife. The lower appellate Court has also held that the evidence of P.Ws. 1 to 3 shows that the defendant/Maharaja Nadar vs Muthukani Ammal on 5 December, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/219392/ 2appellant herein is living with Bommi Ammal, and as such, the plaintiff/respondent herein has justifiable cause to live separately from her husband and demand separate maintenance from him. The lower appellate Court also held that the desertion alleged by the plaintiff/respondent herein is true. The lower appellate Court also held that the defendant/ appellant herein had deserted the plaintiff/respondent herein and also treated her with cruelty. According to the defendant/ appellant herein, items 13 and 14 are the exclusive properties of his mother. The respondent herein has not preferred any cross-objection against the finding of the trial Court awarding maintenance with charge over the 1/4th share of the defendant/appellant on items 1to 12. Therefore, she cannot ask for any charge over items 13 and 14. There is no satisfactory evidence as to the actual income of the defendant/appellant from his family properties. The plaintiff/respondent admits that the defendant/appellant is entitled to only 1/4th share in the properties. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the status of the parties, the quantum of maintenance fixed by the trial Court at Rs. 50/- per mensem and a sum of Rs. 200/- towards the past maintenance cannot be said to be excessive, Therefore, the lower appellate Court held that the respondent is entitled to maintenance, and the quantum of maintenance fixed by the trial Court is fair and reasonable. In the result, the appeal was dismissed with costs, and the judgment and decree of the trial Court were confirmed by the appellate Court. Aggrieved by the above decision of the lower appellate Court, the defendant has come forward with this second appeal. 7. Mr.Ashraf Ali, learned counsel for the defendant/ appellant herein, inter alia, contends that the concept of desertion and cruelty under Hindu Law was not properly appreciated by both by the Courts below, and the lower appellate Court went wrong in confirming the finding of the trial Court that the defendant/ appellant . herein had committed the Acts of desertion and cruelty against his wife the plaintiff/respondent herein. 8. The point for consideration in this Second Appeal is whether the concept of the act of desertion and the act of cruelty under Hindu law, as codified, have been properly understood and applied to the facts of the present case before us. 9. It is not in dispute that the defendant-appellant is the husband of the respondent-plaintiff and their marriage took place 11 years prior to the date of the suit, as per the Hindu custom and usage. It is also not in dispute that they were living happily for some time after marriage and they have no issues. According to the respondent, the appellant often beat her and drove her away to her parent's house and the appellant was treating her with cruelty. Her further case is that her husband asked for her consent to marry a second wife which she refused and in fact the appellant has married one Bommi Ammal, daughter of Manjanatha Nadar of Ariyapuram as his second wife and is, living with her. On the other hand the contention of the defendant is that he never beat his wife and ill-treated her and the cruelty alleged by her is not true. His further defence is that the respondent used to visit her parent's house often without his knowledge and consent and her father used to come and take his daughter often to his house. He would also contend that at last in the-beginning of Sept. 1976; the respondent's father came and took, away the respondent with jewels worth about Rs. 7,000/- presented by the appellant, and when the appellant approached the respondent and asked her to return to his house, her father refused to send her along with the appellant. The appellant denies having married Bommi Ammal as his second wife. According to him, he continues to have love andMaharaja Nadar vs Muthukani Ammal on 5 December, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/219392/ 3",['21']

Heard the learned counsel for the parties. 2. On a petition filed by the respondent under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955 the District and Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar, granted the decree for divorce. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant-non-petitioner, has filed this appeal. 3. According to the averment made in the petition, the marriage between the parties was celebrated on 15-12-1985 according to Hindu rites at Sri Ganganagar. After marriage, the appellant gave birth to a daughter Shobhna who was about 7 years of age on the date of the filing of the petition. The respondent in his petition, prayed for the decree for divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of cruelty. It was alleged in the petition that the respondent's mother was the owner of house No. 5A/38 situated at Jawahar Nagar and the appellant asked the respondent's mother to transfer the house to her and threatened that if the house was not transferred to her, a report would be lodged at the Police Station, Sri Ganganagar alleging cruelty and dowry. The house was constructed by the respondent's mother by spending her hard earned money. On 18-7-1986, the respondent went to Jaipur in order to obtain training. He returned from Jaipur on 7-1-1987. On his return, he came to know that in his absence the appellant-non-petitioner, with the help of her father Bhoor Singh and some others, forcibly entered into house No. 5A/38 situated at Jawaharnagar in which the respondent's parents were residing and after giving beating to the respondent's parents and terrifying them turned them out of the house and unlawfully occupied the house. This incident occurred sometime in January 1987 before the respondent returned from Jaipur. As a consequence of the above Incident, the respondent's parents suffered physical and mental pain and they started residing in a quarter constructed in the hospital where respondent's mother was serving. After returning from Jaipur, respondent contacted the appellant-non-petitioner. She made a false statement before him to the effect that his parents had gone away to the quarter situated in hospital campus after giving the beating to her parents. On the same day, the respondent with some well-wishers went to the house of his mother and found that the appellant-non-petitioner's father BhoorSingh and his helpers were there They misbehaved with the respondent, assaulted him and turned him out of the house. The appellant non-petitioner was present at that time but she did not make any protest against the conduct of his father. It was also alleged in the petition filed by the respondent that on 6-2-1987, the appellant-non-petitioner filed a petition under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate. Sri Ganganagar. That petition was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Sri Ganganagar by order dated 23-12-1989, A revision petition was filed in the Court of Additional District Judge No. 2 and the revision petition was dismissed by the Additional District Judge No. 2 by order dated 10-10-1991. It was alleged by the respondent that in her application the appellant-non-petitioner, with a view to bring bad name to the appellant and his parents made a false allegation to the effect that the petitioner and hisSmt. Pramila Bhatia vs Vijay Kumar Bhatia on 19 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1054644/ 1parents used to harass with the object of forcing her to bring money from her parents and it was also falsely alleged by her that she had brought a sum of Rs. 20,000/- from her father and that a further sum of Rs. 50,000/- was demanded from her. These allegations, according to the averments made in the petition filed by the respondent were false. It was also alleged in the petition that the appellant-non-petitioner filed a Civil Suit No. 77/87 in the Court of the Munsif, Sri Ganganagar. The suit was decreed on 6-2-1991 and an appeal was filed in the Court of Additional District Judge No. 1, Sri Ganganagar against the decree passed by the Munsif, Sri Ganganagar. In appeal, the Additional District Judge No. 1, Sri Ganganagar, set aside the decree passed by the Munsif and allowed the appeal by judgment and decree dated 20-5-1994. When the respondent's mother Kamla Devi filed a suit for recovering the possession of the house No. 5A/38 belonging to her, an objection as to the deficiency of the Court-fee was raised by the appellant-non-petitioner and, therefore, a Court-fee of Rs. 3945/- was paid. The suit was ultimately decreed on 5-8-1993 and an appeal against that decree is pending before the High Court. The case set up by the respondent in his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was that the appellant-non-petitloner is guilty of committing cruelty and that he is entitled to a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty. 4. In reply, it was admitted by the appellant-non-petitioner that her marriage had taken place on 15-12-1985 according to Hindu rites. She denied the allegation that she asked the respondent's mother to transfer the house No. 5A/38 situated in Jawaharnagar to her and gave any threat to her for the purpose of the obtaining the house in her reply, the appellant-non-petitioner alleged that in her marriage, her parents gave dowry beyond their means and that after that she was harassed. With a view to bring money from her parents and when she refused to comply with the demand, she was beaten. It was also alleged that on two occasions, her father gave Rs. 10,000/- on each occasion and these amounts were forcibly taken away by her mother-in-law and further demand of Rs. 50,000/- was made and when she could not comply with this demand, she was subjected to harassment in her reply, the appellant-non-petitioner further pleaded that her mother-in-law voluntarily left the house and went to live in the quarter situated in the hospital campus and this was done with a view to make false allegations against her in short, the allegation of cruelty as alleged in the petition by the respondent was denied. 5. A rejoinder was filed in which all the allegations made by the appellant-non-petitioner were denied by the respondent. 6. The learned District and Sessions Judge framed three issues. The first issue was whether the non-petitioner was guilty of cruelly as alleged in para Nos. 3 to 10 of the petition and the petitioner was entitled to obtain a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The second issue was regarding the question whether the marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken, if so, to what effect. The third issue was regarding relief. 7. The respondent Vijay Kumar Bhatia (A.W. 1) was examined himself and produced her mother Smt. Kamala (A.W. 2) in support of the allegations made by him. The appellant-non-petitioner Smt. Pramila (N.A.W. 1) examined herself and produced her father Bhoor Singh (N. A. W. 2) in support of the case set up by her in the written statement. The certified copies of the statement recorded in earlier proceedings and the certified copies of some other documents were also produced by theSmt. Pramila Bhatia vs Vijay Kumar Bhatia on 19 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1054644/ 2parties. 8. The learned District and Sessions Judge, after considering the evidence of both the parties, decided issues Nos. 1 and 2 in favour of the respondent-petitioner and granted decree for divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty. 9. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the learned District and Sessions Judge has not appreciated the evidence of the parties in the proper perspective and has committed grave error by deciding issues Nos. 1 and 2 together because they deal with different questions. Regarding the allegation of cruelty made by the respondent in his petition as well as in his statement, the learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the allegations of cruelty are completely false and there is absolutely no ground for grant of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. He has prayed that the appeal be allowed and the judgment and decree of divorce granted by the District and Sessions Judge be set aside. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the allegations of cruelty have been proved by oral as well as documentary evidence produced by the respondent-petitioner and the learned District Judge has committed no error in coming to the conclusion that the Issues Nos. 1 and 2 should be decided in favour of the respondent. He has, therefore, prayed for dismissal of this appeal. 10. The expression 'cruelty' has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act. in Smt. Meera v. Vijay Shankar Talchidia AIR 1994 Rajasthan 33. Hon'ble the Chief Justice ob- served (Para 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) : ""Cruelty is a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act . Whether particular conduct amounted to cruelty would be determined in each case. It has not been defined in the Act as it was not possible to do so. Section 13(1)(ia) has undergone a change by 1976 amendment made by the Parliament. Before the amendment of 1976, the Act contained a different formulation of cruelty. At that time, the petitioner was required to show that the respondent had treated him or her with such cruelly as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the respondent. The change in the formulation of cruelty under the Hindu Marriage Act brings it at par with the Special Marriage Act. It has also simplified it. Cruelty in such cases has to be of the type which should satisfy the conscience of the Court to believe that the relations between the parties had deteriorated to such an extent due to the conduct of one of the spouses that it has become impossible for them to live together without mental agony, torture or distress. Cruelty as a ground of divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) is a conduct of such type that the petitioner could not reasonably be expected to live with the respondent. Now, the act or omission or conduct which constitutes cruelty need not cause any sort of apprehension in the mind of the petitioner. No rigid meaning can be assigned to cruelty in order to come under Section 13(1)(ia). What may amount to cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case. in order to considerSmt.

For convenience sake, the parties are referred to here under according to their litigative status before the trial Court. 2. Tersely and briefly, the case of the plaintiff as stood exposited from the plaint could be narrated thus; The deceased V.P.Venkatesan, had two wives namely namely Jayammal, the first defendant herein and one Thulukkanammal. Through his first wife he had one son the second defendant and two daughters, the third and the fourth defendants. Through his second wife he had five children namely the plaintiffs 1 and 5 his sons and the plaintiffs 2 to 4 his daughters. In fact the marriage of V.P.Venkatesan with Thulukkanammal took place in the year 1955 in 'Syuamariyathai' form in Singaperumal Koil in the presence of the villagers. From that time onwards V.P.Venkatesan and Thulukkanammal started living together till his death on 26.09.1985. The properties described in the schedule of the plaint belong to the joint family of V.P.Venkatesan and his sons. Some of those properties are ancestral properties which V.P.Venkatesan got in a partition his brothers earlier. The rest of the properties are his self-acquired properties. V.P.Venkatesan was running a touring Cinema theatre namely ""Kalaichelvei Talkies"" and it was named after the fourth plaintiff. By running the cinema theatre, he earned substantial amount and purchased properties. The defendants 1 and 2 sold item number 15 in favour of the fifth and sixth defendants and hence they were added as parties. The plaintiffs since they happened to be the children of V.P.Venkatesan, through his second wife, as per Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, they are entitled to claim the shares. The said V.P.Venkatesan died on 26.09.1985, whereupon the defendants developed hostile attitude towards the plaintiffs. Hence, the suit for partition is filed with the following prayer; 1) directing a partition of the suit items 1 to 6 into 36 equal shares and allotment of 23 such shares to the plaintiffs; 2) directing the partition of plaint items 7 to 15 into 9 equal shares and allotment of 5 such shares to the plaintiffs; 3) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs future costs; and 4) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs their cost of the suit. 3. Per contra, gainsaying and denying, contradicting and impugning the allegations/averments in the plaint, the first defendant filed the written statement which was certified by the other defendants. The quintessence of it would run thus; No marriage between V.P.Venkatesan and Thulukkanammal took place in the year 1955 in any form much less in ""Suyamariyathai"" form. The plaintiffs are not entitled to invoke Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act and lay claim for any share in the suit properties. The first defendant did not remove movables worth Rs.35,600/-. V.P.Venkatesan had illicit relationship with Thulukkanammal, who was wife of one Srinivasan and hence no marriage could have taken place between V.P.VenkatesanJayammal vs V.Kumar on 2 July, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/667384/ 2and Thulukkanammal and the plaintiffs are not entitled to the suit properties. In fact, Thulukkanammal and the first plaintiff removed 20 sovereigns of gold jewels and cash of Rs.5,000/- from the deceased V.P.Venkatesan. Accordingly, he prayed for dismissal of the suit. The other defendants adopted the written statement of the first defendant. 4. The trial Court framed the relevant issues. During trial, on the side of the plaintiff, the first plaintiff examined himself as PW1 along with Thulukkanammal, the second wife of V.P.Venkatesan and Ex.A1 to Ex.A27 were marked. The first defendant examined herself as DW1 along with her witness Rajaveni Ammal and Ex.B1 to Ex.B14 were marked. The trial Court ultimately decreed the suit as prayed for and a preliminary decree was also passed. 5. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and preliminary decree of the trial Court, the defendants filed this appeal on the following grounds among others; The judgment and preliminary decree of the trial Court is against law, weight of evidence and all probabilities of the case. The plaintiffs has not proved that they were born to V.P.Venkatesan. The trial Court relied on the statement of the first defendant in O.P.No.2/1985, but failed to rely on the statement of V.P.Venkatesan in the same proceedings. V.P.Venkatesan did not marry Thulukkanammal at all. Ignoring the fact that the marriage between Thulukkanammal and her husband Srinivasan subsisted till the death of V.P.Venkatesan the trial Court decreed the suit and hence the plaintiffs cannot claim any share over the properties not acquired by V.P.Venkatesan. Accordingly, the defendants prayed for dismissal of the suit. 6. The points for consideration are; 1. Whether V.P.Venkatesan and Thulukkanammal underwent some form of marriage as one contemplated under Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act so as to enable the plaintiffs to lay claim over the properties of V.P.Venkatesan? 2. Whether the plaintiffs are the children born to V.P.Venkatesan and Thulukkanammal and if so they could invoke Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act to claim shares in the properties of V.P.Venkatesan? and 3. If so whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim share in the properties namely the item numbers 1 to 6 which V.P.Venkatesan got it in the partition between his brothers and himself?. 4. Whether there is any infirmity in the judgment and decree of the trial Court? 7. The points 1 and 2 are taken together for discussion as they are inter-linked and inter-woven with each other. The gist and kernel of the case of the defendants is that V.P.Venkatesan had only one legitimate wife by name Jeyammal, the first defendant, and the defendants 2 to 4 are their children; the plaintiffs are having no right to claim that they are the legal heirs of the deceased V.P.Venkatesan;Jayammal vs V.Kumar on 2 July, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/667384/ 3",['16']

BY THE COURT: (Per Hon'ble Mr. Justice Prakash Tatia) The facts in brief as pleaded by both the appellants are that both the appellants fell in love with each other and without the consent of their parent entered into wedlock on 26.8.206 by following the rites of Arya Samaj. They could not live together for DBCMA NO.518/2008 Girdhari Maheshwari & Anr. Vs. NIL ~2~ a single day (or night) as immediately after their marriage, the fact of marriage of the appellants came in knowledge of their parents and they did not accept this marriage. Because of above fact situation only, the appellants stated that the ""appellants do not want to live together nor they want to continue this marriage relation because they contacted the marriage because of theirGirdhari Maheshwari & Anr vs Nil on 24 September, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197092/ 1lack of understanding"". They further pleaded that not only they did not live together for a single day (or night) after marriage, but they did not meet with each other for a single moment after the marriage. With these averments, the appellants, husband and wife filed present petition before the Family Court under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 1955) for obtaining mutual consent divorce decree. They pleaded that now both the parties- the appellants, after obtaining the divorce decree by mutual consent, shall live separate from each other and both the appellants want to marry with other persons, the person who has been chosen or suggested by their parents or family members, therefore, both the appellants submitted that for this their family DBCMA NO.518/2008 Girdhari Maheshwari & Anr. Vs. NIL ~3~ members also agreed (or appellants agreed to wishes of their parents). With these pleadings, the appellants prayed that therefore, they are submitting this mutual consent divorce petition under Section 13B of the Act of 1955 and appellants prayed that their matrimonial relation may be dissolved from today itself by dispensation with the requirement of six months waiting period as provided under Section 13B of the Act of 1955, which restricts the court from passing the decree for divorce before period of six months from the date of presentation of petition under Section 13B of the Act of 1955. It appears from the copies of the divorce petition and application submitted for dispensing from waiting period of six months for divorce decree as required by sub-section (2) of Section 13B and the copies of the affidavit of parties and there relatives, which makes it clear that the appellants submitted this petition for divorce by mutual consent as they may have been advised to do so by legal experts who gone through the various judgments, which according to appellants indicates that the requisite period of six months before DBCMA NO.518/2008 Girdhari Maheshwari & Anr. Vs. NIL ~4~ which decree for divorce even by mutual consent can be granted by the court, has been considered and as per the learned counsel for the appellants, following the policy of liberalization in the matter of grant of divorce, the condition for waiting for six months after presentation of petition under Section 13B of the Act of 1955 for mutual consent divorce is held not mandatory and this period can be dispensed with by the court. Therefore, the appellants who sought divorce forthwith, on the same day, from the court under Section 13B of the Act of 1955 annexed an application for condonation of period of six months for grant of divorce and quoted the following authorities in support of their prayer for condoning the period of six months. These are the judgment referred in the application of the appellants dated 24th March, 2008, which was filed on the same date on which the divorce petition was filed under Section 13B of the At of 1955. 1. 1995(2) CCC 164 (P&H) Lalit Kumar @ Manga Vs.

In place of any of the parent of the appellant no.1, one Bhagwan Birla, the relative of the appellant no.1 submitted a brief affidavit stating therein that appellant no.l1 contacted marriage with appellant no.2 as per the procedure (rites) of Arya Samaj on 26.8.2006 and their living together is not possible and, therefore, decree for divorce may be DBCMA NO.518/2008 Girdhari Maheshwari & Anr. Vs. NIL ~6~ granted. A joint motion application as required by sub-section (2) of Section 13B of the Act of 1955 was also submitted alongwith the main petition for divorce under Section 13B of the Act of 1955 by both the parties. The trial court vide order dated 15th April, 2008 after referring the judgments relied upon by the appellants, which are referred in their application for condonation of delay of six months period before passing the decree for divorce, rejected the appellants' application vide impugned order dated 15.4.2008, hence, this appeal has been preferred by the appellants. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that requirement of waiting period of six months as provided under sub-section (2) of Section 13B of the Act of 1955 is not mandatory as held by the various High Courts and further submitted that in view of the fact that marriage of the appellant no.2 has already been fixed and wedding cards have already been got printed and then distributed, therefore, the divorce decree may be granted forthwith by dispensing with the ""formality"" of waiting period of six months under DBCMA NO.518/2008 Girdhari Maheshwari & Anr. Vs. NIL ~7~ Section 13B(3) of the Act of 1955. In view of the very peculiar facts of the case, we would like to look again into the law on marriage in Hindu community as both the parties are governed by the Hindu law. Before coming into force the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the subject of Hindu marriage the Hindus was governed by their personal law. The concept of divorce was not there in old Shastric Hindu Law. The view of some of the authors on subject of marriage are relevant, which we would like to refer hereunder: S.K. Mitra in ""Mitra on Hindu Law"" Second Edition says that, the concept of Hindu Marriage has been described as a: ""religious ceremony which results in a sacred and a holy union of man and wife, by which the wife is completely transplanted in the household of her husband, a new birth as a partner of her husband, becoming a part and parcel of the body of her husband. It has primordial importance in the contemplation of law. On the one hand, it signifies the spiritual union of man and woman, as husband and wife and on the other hand, it conceives of the basic principle of mutuality bringing two parties together with the forces of social milieu, developing since the age-old times of civilization.

214,"Bombay High Court Baby vs Jayant Mahadeo Jagtap And Ors. on 29 January, 1981 Equivalent citations: AIR 1981 Bom 283, 1981 (83) ARBLR 312 Bom, 1982 (1) BomCR 80 Bench: Bhonsale JUDGMENT 1. This is an appeal filed by the original complainant, the first wife, challenging the order of acquittal dated May 28, 1979 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Baramati, acquitting both the respondents for having committed offences punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 834 of 1976. 2. The appeal raises a question of considerable importance affecting a large section of the Indian Society, that is, members of the Scheduled Castes who have chosen to convert themselves into the Buddhist faith. It involves a question of recognition in law of the customary form of marriage different from the form of marriage generally recognised under the Hindu Law. 2-A. Since this appeal involves recognition of a different form of marriage widely followed and recognised amongst the members of the Buddhist community (converted from Scheduled Castes), it is necessary to refer to the averments in the complaint of the complainant as to what form of marriage is followed in their community to which parties admittedly belong to. The complainant in her complaint, Exh. 1, filed in the court of the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Baramati, on July 22, 1976, states as follows :-- ""The complainant and the accused belong to Buddhist religion. Amongst their community belonging to Buddhist religion, the form of marriage is as follows :-- The bride and the bridegroom after taking their bath and after wearing new clothes are brought to the marriage hall. In the marriage hall the photographs of Lord Buddha and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar are placed on a chair and those photographs are worshipped and garlanded by them. Thereafter, both the bride and bridegroom stand with folded hands before these two photographs and after respectfully bowing to these photographs recite the following:-- ^^cqðe~ 'kj.ke~ xPNkfe /kEee~ 'kja.kea~ xPNkfe] la/ke~ 'kj.ke~ xPNkfe-** Thereafter, sacred ceremonial mantras, i.e. ^^eaxyk""Vds** are recited. The brideand bridegroom garland each other and take oath to the effect that as wife and husband they will henceforth conduct towards each other happily; that they shall conduct their family relations with happiness. After this oath is taken, the people who are present in the marriage hall shower flowers on the bride and bridegroom and thereafter the betel leaves and betel nuts are distributed amongst the guests and the band is played."" 3. In para 2 of the complaint, complainant has stated that, according to this custom and rites of their caste and religion, she was married with accused No. 1 at Baramati on August 18, 1971, All the rites and ceremonies were performed at the time of her marriage with accused No. 1 and thereafter the complainant went to the residence of her husband at Kambleshwar and continued to stay there as his legally wedded wife. Accused No. 1 treated the complainant in a normal way for a few months.Baby vs Jayant Mahadeo Jagtap And Ors. on 29 January, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1310760/ 1However, after 3 or 4 months accused No. 1 started harassing, torturing and beating the complainant. He used to leave the complainant at her parent's house for no reason and even began to suspect her fidelity. Accused No. 1 gave notice dated June 14, 1973 through one advocate Shri R.K. Patil. This notice was false and mischievous inasmuch as it was stated in the notice that as per custom a divorce had taken place between the complainant and accused No. 1. In fact, there was no such customary divorce recognised in the community nor has such a divorce taken place between the complainant and accused No. 1. By reply dated 20, 1973 (sic) through her Advocate Shri A.R. Pise, the complainant refuted the allegations in the notice under reply. As a result of this notice, accused No. 1 managed to persuade the complainant and again took her to his house. However, after a couple of months accused No. 1 sent the complainant to her parents' house again and gave a public notice through his advocate Shri A.S. Lalgunkar in the Marathi daily known as ""Vishal Sahyadri"" on March 18, 1976 stating therein that accused No. 1 had given a customary divorce to the complainant. The complainant further averred in her complaint that marital relationship as husband and wife between accused No. 1 and herself at no point of time was terminated in this manner by such a public notice, As there was no divorce between the complainant and accused No. 1, the relationship between them as husband and wife continued. The complainant thereafter through her advocate Shri G. T, Godbole issued a notice dated January 20, 1976 to accused No. 1 demanding maintenance as he neglected and refused to maintain her. 4. The complainant further stated in the said complaint that while her marriage with accused No. 1 was subsisting, he again married with accused No. 2. Accused No. 2 was related to accused No. 1 and she knew that the marriage with accused No. 1 and the complainant was subsisting on the date of the second marriage. However, both these accused Nos. 1 and 2 in spite of the subsisting marriage between the complainant and accused No. 1, got married on July 30, 1976 at Kambleshwar. The complainant has further stated in her complaint that she had heard that accused No. 1 was going to marry accused No. 2 and, therefore she had issued a notice dated July 10, 1976 to accused No. 1 asking him not to marry with accused No. 2. However, that notice was returned as 'refused' and is part of the record in this case. 5. At the end of the complaint, the complainant has cited a number of witnesses including three advocates and three other witnesses i.e. her father P.W. 2 Anandrao Raghunath Sonawane, P.W. 3 Mohan Shankar Ahiwale and P.W. 4 Tukaram Dashrath Jagtap. In the complaint, the complainant therefore prayed that accused Nos. 1 and 2 having committed offences punishable under Section 434 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code be dealt with according to law. 6. The learned trial Magistrate framed charges against both the accused on February 7, 1979 for having committed offences punishable under Section 484 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code. To these charges both the accused pleaded not guilty and from the examination under Section 313 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 it would appear that they abjured their guilt altogether and their defence is one of total denial. 7. In the trial Court the complainant examined herself in support of the complaint. Apart from producing two documents, i.e. the wedding invitation card and the marriage extract from the Gram Panchayat. Kambleshwar, Taluka Baramati. District Pune regarding the marriage of accused No. 1Baby vs Jayant Mahadeo Jagtap And Ors. on 29 January, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1310760/ 2with accused No. 2, she also examined her father, P.W. 2 Anandrao Raghunath Sonawane, P, W. 3 Mohan Shankar Ahiwale, and P.W. 4 Tukaram Dashrath Jagtap. The certificate issued by the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat at Kambleshwar. Taluka Baramati, District Pune is ""to the effect that, ""Shri Jayant Mahadeo Jagtap, resident of Kambleshwar, has married one Hemlata daughter of Jayant Sitaram Thorat, One Manik Bhiva Kumbhar has given this information."" 8. The testimony of the complainant Baby is in terms of her complaint filed by her in the trial Court, According to her evidence, she had married accused No. 1 according to Buddhist customary form of marriage as well as according to Buddhist rites and religion, Since both she and accused No. 1 belonged to the Buddhist caste and religion in her deposition she stated the customary form of marriage amongst the Buddhist community and she further stated that a pandal (wedding hall) is erected and photographs of Lord Buddha and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar were placed on a chair. These photographs are worship ed and thereafter oath is taken by the bridal couple by reciting, ^^cqðe~ 'kj.ke~ xPNkfe /kEee~ 'kja.kea~ xPNkfe] la/ke~ 'kj.ke~ xPNkfe-** After this oath is taken, the bridal couple gar land each other. After giving this evidence of the form of marriage which was celebrated in 1971 in which year she got married with accused No. 1. she further gave evidence again in terms of heir complaint of her living with her husband and spoke about the harassment, torture and beating meted out to her by accused No. 1, She flatly denied having given any customary divorce to accused No. 1 and, in any case, it was not recognised by the community to which the parties belonged. She also further deposed that she continued to be the legally wedded wife of accused No. 1 and her marriage subsisted with accused No. 1 when accused No. 1 performed the second marriage with accused No. 2. She has admitted that she was not present at the time of second marriage of accused No. 1. However, she and her father had received information about the factum of the second marriage from P.W. 3 Mohan Shankar Ahiwale and P.W. 4 Tukaram Dashrath Jagtap who were in fact eye witnesses to this second marriage between accused No I and accused No. 2 which was celebrated according to the customary form of Buddhist marriages. In the cross-examination she had denied that as she was not given any maintenance by accused No. 1, she filed this false complaint. Her own Marathi version is as follows :-- ßTkkc ns.kkj iksVxh nsr ukgh ok eyk ukanor ukgh Eg.kwu eh gh [kksVh dsl dsyh vkgs] gs Eg.k.ks [k+js ukghÞ In other words, the suggestion is that a false case was filed against accused No. 1 by the first wife as accused No. 1 was not giving any maintenance to the complainant nor taking her to the matrimonial home of her husband. At this stage, it may be pertinent to remember that, this suggestion is of considerable importance inasmuch as implicit in the suggestion is the admission of accused No. 1 that even on the date of cross-examination, the first marriage with the complainant was subsisting and therefore his entire case that he had given a customary divorce to the complainant is devoid of any merit or substance whatsoever. This evidence was sufficient for the learned trial Magistrate to come to the conclusion that the marriage between the complainant and accused No. 1 was subsisting on the date of the second marriage. 9. Petitioner complainant has also examined her father, P.W. No. 1 Anandrao Raghunath Sonawane, who has given evidence regarding the nature and the form and ceremonies of a Buddhist marriage when accused No. 1 got married to his daughter, the complainant.

An application for vacating the stay order was filed on behalf of opposite party No. 2. The said application was listed for orders on 20th March 1997. Mr. Govind Krishna, learned counsel for the opposite party, took a preliminary objection. He contended that under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, an appeal lies against the impugned order before the learned District Judge. Therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable. Mr. A. Kumar, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, disputed the said contention on various grounds. Since the hearing could not be completed the matter was adjourned till 9th of April 1997. On the next date, it was further adjourned till 12th May 1997. On 25th April 1997, both the learned counsel pointed out that the matter was fixed on 24th April, 1997 but by mistake the date was noted as 12th May, 1997 in the order dated 9th April, 1997. Accordingly the matter was fixed on 9th May, 1997 instead of 12th May, 1997 by an order dated 25th April, i 997 by the consent of the parties for the reasons recorded in the order dated 25th April, 1997. 2. On 9th May 1997, an application for amendment was tiled in the Court by Mr. A. Kumar, copy of the said application was served upon Mr. Govind Krishna on 24th April, 1997. Mr. Govind Krishna insisted that by reason of the interim order, the opposite party No. 2 has been suffering great prejudice. Therefore, the application for amendment may be taken up for hearing immediately. He submitted that in view of the statements made in the application for amendment which is a belated one, he does not propose to file any counter affidavit to the said application for amendment. However, he would contest the same on merit and the opposite party No. 2 does not admit any of the statements made in the said application for amendment. Mr. Govind Krishna also proposed that right from 20th March, 1997, he was insisting upon disposal of the whole matter since the writ petition is not maintainable. Therefore, he is prepared to argue on the merit of the case along with his contention in opposition to the application for amendment. Therefore, the whole matter may be heard and the same may be finally disposed of. Mr. A. Kumar agree to the proposition. By the consent of the parties, the whole matter is taken up for hearing along with the application for amendment. Both the learned counsel addressed extensively on the merits of the case in support of their respective contentions while supporting and opposing the application for amendment. The question of disposal of the application for amendment also depended, as argued by both the counsel, on the merits of the case. The question was so intricate and involved the whole dispute it was necessary to refer to the merits of the case as well. For the sake of convenience and proper understanding of the dispute, the Court had agreed to the proposal suggested by both the learned counsel as above and treats the matter with the consent of the parties as on day's list for hearing together with the application for amendment and the application for vacating the interim order. 3. Since the facts are a little elaborate and appears to be on the marginal line of complicated one, reference to the facts would help us in grasping the emerging situation. The facts are not disputed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties. The admitted facts, as emerges from theArun Lata vs Civil Judge And Ors. on 23 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163181/ 1record, are as folllows. 4. The opposite party No. 2 Arvind Kumar and the petitioner Arun Lata were married on 4th May, 1980. Arvind Kumar is a lawyer practising at Bulandshahr. He instituted a suit for divorce being Divorce petition No. 208 of 1981 in the Court of Civil Judge, Bulandshahr on 23rd July, 1981. A child out of the wedlock was born on 15th March, 1982. The suit for Divorce was decreed ex parte on 5th May, 1982 (Annexure '1'). In the said suit, no interim order was passed with regard to the custody or maintenance of the child. Neither any provision with regard thereto was incorporated in the decree. On 23rd May, 1994, Arvind Kumar filed an application under the Guardians and Wards Act for the custody of the child. The same was registered as Misc. Case No. 22 of 1984. Arvind Kumar had also filed Case No. 440 of 1984 for certain other reliefs against Prakash Rani and others including Arun Lata before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Bulandshahr. At this stage, Arun Lata sought for transfer of respective cases from Bulandshahr to Delhi, on which the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to issue notice on Arvind by an order dated 11th July, 1984 (Annexure '2'). By an order dated 20th February, 1985 (Annexure '3'), the Transfer Petition was disposed of. In the said order, it was recorded that both the parties had agreed that all the cases filed by them against each other would forthwith be withdrawn and that Arvind Kumar will pay Rs. 200/- per month regularly for maintenance of their only son with effect from March 1, 1985. Accordingly the parties had undertaken to withdraw all the cases. In terms of the said order dated 20th February 1985 both case No. 440 of 1984 and Misc. No. 22 of 1984 were withdrawn by Arvind Kumar. 5. Subsequently on 30th September, .1991, Arvind Kumar filed Case No. 200 of 1991 under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act against Arun Lata for the custody of the said child. And 20th October, 1991 was the date fixed in the said Case No. 200 of 1991. She sent a telegram on 21st October 1991 (Annexures '4' and''5')intimating the Court that she had fallen ill and, therefore, the case may be adjourned. The said Case No. 200 of 1991 was ultimately allowed ex parte by an order dated 26th October, 1991 (Annexure '6'). Arun Lata filed Misc. Case No. 239 of 1991 for setting aside the ex parte order dated 26th October, 1991. On account of non-appearance of her counsel, Misc. Case No. 239 of 1991 was dismissed by an order dated 20th, November, 1992 (Annexure '7'). Arun Lata filed Misc. Case No. 134 of 1992 for restoration of Misc. Case No. 239 of 1991. By an order dated 14th May, 1993, on account of non-appearance of Arun Lata's counsel. Misc. Case No. 134 of 1992 was dismissed for default. Arvind Kumar thereupon filed an application under Section 28-A for execution of the ex parte order dated 26th October, 1991. The same was registered as Execution Case No. 34 of 1993 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Bulandshahr. The said execution was allowed by an order dated 31st May, 1993 passed ex parte (Annexure '12'). In the said order, a direction was given to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Bulandshahr to provide police assistance for bringing the child and produce him in the Court on 5th July, 1993 for delivery of custody to Arvind Kumar. For compliance of the said order, 13th August, 1993 was fixed. Arun Lata has now filed this writ petition seeking to quash the orders dated 31st May 1993 and 26th October, 1991. 6. By an order dated 12th August, 1993 passed in the present writ petition, the operation of the order dated 31st May, 1993 was stayed till further orders. It is this order which has been sought to be vacated by means of the application for vacating the interim order by Mr. Govind Krishna appearing on behalf of Arvind Kumar.Arun Lata vs Civil Judge And Ors. on 23 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163181/ 27.

He also contended that the amendment, if allowed, would not only change the complexion of the case made out by the petitioner, it would also change the whole nature and character of the proceedings. Mr. Kumar on the other hand, contended that amendment would neither change the complexion of the case nor would have the effect of changing the nature and character of the case. The situation is as such that the delay cannot stand in the way of allowing the amendment in the special facts and circumstances of the present case. Inasmuch as it is only another point of view on which the orders impugned could be assailed has been sought to be incorporated as ground. It is only in effect supplemental and are elaboration of the grounds already taken. The objection taken is technical since the order dated 26th October, 1991 has already been challenged. The other three orders dated 13th April, 1992, 20th may 1992 and 14th May, 1993 have been sought to be included by way of mere formalities. Therefore, the amendment should be allowed. 9. I have heard both the counsel on the question of amendment. The fact remains that it was the order dated 29th October, 1991 in execution whereof the order dated 31st May, 1993 was passed and these are the two principal orders on which the rights of the parties survive in favour of or against the one or the other. The other two orders dated 13th April, 1992 and 20th May, 1992 are the orders by which the applications for recalling the order dated 26th October, 1991 were dismissed for default. Therefore, those are only ancillary orders. In case the order dated 26th October, 1991 is set aside, then the said orders dated 13th April, 1992 and 20th May, 1992 would become redundantArun Lata vs Civil Judge And Ors. on 23 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163181/ 3","['28', '26', '28-A']"
216,"Bombay High Court William Rebello vs Jose Agnelo Vaz And Another on 23 November, 1995 Equivalent citations: AIR 1996 Bom 204, II (1996) DMC 339 Bench: B Deshmukh JUDGMENT 1. This Appeal raises an important question of law with regard to the application of the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, and the point raised is of public importance. 2. The provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act are extended to Goa, Damans and Diu by virtue of the Regulation 11 of 1963. A notification was issued on 5th January, 1965 by the Government and the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act are brought into force in this area with effect from 1st February, 1965. 3. An application came to be filed in the Court of the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Vasco-da-Gama by the Applicants, i.e., Jose Agnelo Vaz and Miss Elemina Almeida for dispensing with the age limit of the marriage and to give necessary directions to the Civil Registration Authority to register the marriage of the Applicants. 4. The application was made in view of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the Portuguese Civil Code. As Applicant No. I was not 21 years of age and could not marry, therefore, the learned trial Judge was requested to remove the impediment, as both the parents of Applicant No. 1 were dead and the consent of the other relatives also could not be obtained. The death certificates of both the parents of Applicant No. 1 were annexed with the application. It was also mentioned that the guardian of Applicant No. 1 has no objection for the marriage; so also, the parents of Applicant No. 2 have given consent for such marriage. 5. In the application, it was contended that as a result of friendship between Applicants Nos. 1 and 2, Applicant No. 2 -- Miss Elemina Almeida -- became pregnant and the pregnancy was of 20 weeks old. 6. The learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, has found that Applicant No. 1 - Mr. Vaz -- was falling short by about 8 months to complete 21 years of age; and Applicant No. 2 is found to have completed the age of 18 years. 7. The application for removal of impediment was entertained under the provisions of Article 5 of the Portuguese Civil Code; and the learned trial Judge, on the basis of the submissions made on oaths before him by the respectable persons -- Angelina Gracious, Mario Pereira and Francisco Xavier Cardozo -- to the effect that Applicants Nos. 1 and 2 are match to each other and their marriage will be ideal one, considered the application. He has further taken into consideration the fact that the cordial relations of Applicants Nos, 1 and 2 resulted into pregnancy of Applicant No. 2; and having regard to the interest of the children, and also of the child that would be born to the couple after delivery, thought it fit to remove the impediment and accordingly allowed the application. It is further mentioned in the order that under the provisions of Article 6 of theWilliam Rebello vs Jose Agnelo Vaz And Another on 23 November, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/289279/ 1Portuguese Civil Code, he feels it necessary to grant emancipation for removal of the impediment of the age limit. Accordingly, he passed the order directing for removal of impediment for this marriage and he has given further directions to the Civil Registrar to register their marriage. 8. As the directions in respect of the registration of the marriage were not followed, an application for contempt was filed. On the contempt application, the Civil Registrar of Vasco-da-Gama was directed to file affidavit before the Court within seven days in respect of his initiation of the proceedings to register the marriage of the Applicant within reasonable period, keeping in view the fact that Applicant No. 2 would deliver baby within a short time. The order in contempt was also directed to be communicated to the Civil Registrar, Vasco-da-Gama, Goa, for immediate compliance. 24th NOVEMBER, 1995. 9. Thereafter, the Civil Registrar has initiated the proceedings and the marriage is accordingly registered. 10. The orders passed by the learned trial Judge on Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 3 of 1992, and thereafter, in contempt proceedings, are challenged in this Appeal. 11. Shri H. R. Bharne, the learned Government Advocate, contended that the decision given by the learned trial Judge is causing great inconvenience and the Civil Registrars are receiving applications for the registration of such marriages on the basis of the orders passed by the learned trial Judge in this matter. 12. Shri Bharne has further contended that the orders passed by the learned trial Judge are in utter violation of the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, as amended from time to time. According to him, the learned trial Judge should not have issued any directions in respect of the registration of the marriage of Applicants Nos. 1 and 2, as the said marriage is performed in contravention of the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act. The said marriage, according to him, is contracted between the parties, who are liable for punishment under the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act. 13. This Appeal filed by the Civil Registrar of Vasco-da-Gama indicates the anxiety of the State Government, as the attempts to implement the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act are getting frustrated, as people are asking for registration of marriage on the basis of the order passed by the learned trial Judge in this matter. 14. The orders, which are passed by the learned trial Judge, are supported by Shri Joseph Vaz, learned Counsel appearing for Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 -- original Applicants Nos. 1 and 2. According to Shri Vaz, the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act are not violated by the learned trial Judge. According to him, a social obligation cast on the Courts under Articles 5 and 6 of the Portuguese Civil Code is performed by the learned trial Judge; and the intervention of the learned trial Judge was necessitated because of the circumstances and peculiar facts of this case.William Rebello vs Jose Agnelo Vaz And Another on 23 November, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/289279/ 215. Shri Vaz has further contended that the marriage is directed to be registered by removing the impediments, under the Provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the Portuguese Civil Code, which are Family Laws in the State of Goa. Shri Vaz contended that the provisions of the Family Laws take precedence over the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act. His further contention is that the provisions of the Portuguese Civil Code (containing Family Laws) amount to a special law and local law, which, under the rules of interpretation, takes precedence over the general law, which is incorporated in the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act. 16. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, was amended in the year 1978 by Amending Act 2 of 1978; and the definition of 'child' is substituted by the said Amending Act 2 of 1978, which defines 'child', ""means person who, if a male, has not completed twenty-one years of age, and if a female, has not completed eighteen years of age. ""Section 6 of the said Amending Act 2 of 1978 further provides for the amendments of certain enactments and recites that _the enactments specified in the Schedule are hereby amended in the manner mentioned therein. In the Schedule to the Amending Act 2 of 1978, certain sections of only two enactments stand amended. One of them is the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, and in Section 60 of that Act, following amendments were provided for by the said Schedule : ""in Section 60. - (i) in condition number (1), for the words 'eighteen years' and 'fifteen years', the words 'twenty-one years' and 'eighteen years' shall respectively be substituted; (ii) the proviso shall be omitted."" The second Act, which stood amended by the said Amending Act 2 of 1978, is the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in which the following amendments were made : ""(1) In Section 5.- (i) in clause (iii), for the words 'eighteen years' and 'fifteen years', the words 'twenty-one years' and 'eighteen years' shall respectively be substituted; (ii) Clause (vi) shall be omitted.

217,"Madras High Court V.B. Jaganathan vs A.R. Srividhya on 8 July, 1997 Equivalent citations: (1997) 2 MLJ 366 Author: S Subramani ORDER S.S. Subramani, J. 1. Husband in H.M.O.P. No. 80 of 1994, on the file of the Subordinate Judge's Court, Trichy, is the revision petitioner herein. The marital relationship between petitioner and respondent has been terminated by a decree of divorce, and the same has become final. Pending the petition for divorce, respondent filed I.A. No. 256 of 1996 for return of certain articles which she claimed as her own and she prayed before the court below that necessary direction be given to the husband to return the same. In the affidavit filed by her in support of the application, she said that she was given 25 sovereigns of gold and cash of Rs. 10,000 and other household articles and the same were entrusted to her husband, which were given to her as 'Sridhana'. He was given 16 grams of gold chain on the eve of first Deepavali. She wanted return of all these things and also the cash. 2. Petitioner herein denied the above allegation and he also contested the jurisdiction of the court to pass on order. 3. By the impugned order, after taking evidence, the lower court came to the conclusion that the respondent is entitled to get back all the ornaments and Rs. 10,000 which was given to her at the time of marriage. The contention that the court has no jurisdiction was found against. Before this Court, learned Counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the Order of the court below is without jurisdiction and against the provisions of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Learned Counsel submitted that unless the respondent herein admits that it is the joint property that belonged to both parties, the court below will not have jurisdiction to dispose of the same. In this case, the respondent herein claimed that 25 sovereigns of ornaments and a gold chain and also a cash of Rs. 10,000 belonged to her only and did not belong to both parties jointly. When the sole ownership is claimed by the wife, the Matrimonial Court will have no jurisdiction and the ordinary civil remedy will have to be resorted to for recovering the same. 4. How far the said contention can be accepted is the only question to be decided in this case. 5. Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus: In any proceeding under this Act, the court may make such provisions in the decree as it deems just and proper with respect to any property presented, at or about the time of marriage, which may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife. 6. Learned Counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that there is no reported decision of this Court on this point and the decision of other High Courts is to the effect that when one of the parties to a marriage claims the property as belonging to him or her exclusively, the court will not pass an order under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act.V.B. Jaganathan vs A.R. Srividhya on 8 July, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1070669/ 17. Learned Counsel for the revision petitioner relied on the following decisions : (1) M.D. Krishnan v. M.C. Padma A.I.R. 1968 Mys. 226. In para. 17 of the judgment, a Division Bench of that High Court held thus: ...the jurisdiction of the matrimonial court under Section 27 of the Act is only to make order with respect to property presented at or about the time of marriage and which belong jointly to both the husband and wife. So before an order is made under this section, it must be shown that the property in respect of which a claim is made was presented at or about the time of marriage, the matrimonial court would not get any jurisdiction to make order in respect of the property presented subsequent to the marriage. (2) In Shukla v. Brij Bhushan A.I.R. 1982 Delhi 223, a learned Judge of that court held that the individual property of a property of a party of a marriage cannot be a subject-matter of disposal under Section 27 of the Act. In that case, the learned Judge said that Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act is a substantive provision empowering the court in any proceeding under the said Act to make a just and proper order regarding property presented at or about the time of the marriage of the parties and belonging jointly to both of them. The court exercising the jurisdiction under the Act is powerless to deal with properties exclusively belonging to one or the other spouse. In that case, the learned Judge said that since the wife claimed certain properties exclusively, the provisions of Section 27 will not come to her aid. Learned Judge further said that neither the provision under Section 151, C.P.C. read with Order 7, Rule 7, C.P.C. can be invoked in such cases. The decision reported in Kamta Prasad v. Om Wati . (3) In Subhash Lata v. V.N. Khanna , a learned Judge of the Delhi High Court also followed an earlier decision of that High Court. (4) In Vinod Kumar v. State (F.B.), a Full Bench of that High Court, in paragraph 30 held thus: ...The express words of the provision refer to property 'which may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife.' It nowhere says that all the wife's property belongs jointly to the couple or that strindhana is abolished and she cannot be the exclusive owner thereof. Indeed, in using the above terminology, the statute expressly recognises that property which is exclusively owned by the wife is not within the ambit of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act and it is concerned only with that property presented at or about the time of the marriage, and belonging jointly to couple.... 8. The said decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court came for consideration before the Supreme Court in the decision reported in Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar and Anr. . 9. Learned Counsel submitted that if the 'Sridhana' property absolutely belonged to the respondent herein and the same cannot be treated as jointly possessed or owned by the parties, no order could be passed by the Matrimonial Court, and the remedy can only be by an ordinary civil court for the said purpose. Learned Counsel also submitted that the principle that the property belonging to the wife retains the character as her own is recognised by the Supreme Court in Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar and Anr. , and the decision reported in Vinod Kumar v. State (F.B.), still holds good. 10. As against the said contention, learned Counsel for respondent relied on the decision reported in (1) Kamta Prasad v. Om Wati , wherein a learned Judge of that Court held that even though SectionV.B. Jaganathan vs A.R. Srividhya on 8 July, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1070669/ 227 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals only with the joint properties of the husband and wife, since the provision of Civil Procedure Code is made applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, invoking the powers under Section 151, C.P.C. read with Order 1, Rule 7, C.P.C., the court also can give directions regarding separate properties to either parties. It is only incidental to the power already exercised. It is not going against the provisions of the Statute. It further held that where even disputed question could be resolved and decided, and necessary relief could be granted, it was only natural that admitted or proved fact also can be taken into consideration to grant the relief. (2) Learned Counsel also relied on the decision reported in Sangeeta Balakrishna Kadam v. Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam A.I.R. 1994 Bom. I, where a Division Bench of that High Court held that the court is entitled to exercise its discretion and pass orders in relation to other forms of property not covered under Section 27 of the Act. 11. In another decision reported in Nirmala Gupta v. Ravendra Kumar , also, a similar view was taken. 12. The question that has to be considered is, whether the court is entitled to pass orders on properties claimed by one of the spouses while exercising powers under the Hindu Marriage Act. 13. All the High Courts are unanimous in regard to the scope of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Law says that court is entitled to invoke its powers only if the property belongs jointly to husband and wife. The High Courts of Allahabad, Madhya Pradesh and Bombay, and in the earlier decision the High Court of Delhi, in Anju Bhargava v. Rajesh Bhargava (1986) 2 Hindu L.R. 393, have also taken the view that even if the property belongs to one of the spouses, even though Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act may not apply, invoking Section 151 read with Order 7, Rule 7, C.P.C., relief could be granted and the spouse retaining the property as such can be directed to return the same. 14. The lower court has accepted the view by invoking the powers under Section 151, C.P.C. Naturally, we have to consider, what is the scope of Section 151, C.P.C. 15. In Bajrang Rai v. Ismail Mian , five Judges of that High Court considered the scope of Section 151, C.P.C. and held thus: (i) The inherent powers of the court are very wide and are not in any way controlled by the provisions of the Code : (ii) They are in addition to the powers specially conferred on the court by the Code and the courts are free to exercise them; (iii) The only limitation out on the exercise of the inherent powers is that when exercised, they are not in conflict with what has been expressly provided for, or those exhaustively covering a particular topic, or against the intention of the Legislature. These limitations are not due to the fact that the inherent power is controlled by the Code, but because it should be presumed that the procedure specifically provided for orders in certain circumstances is dictated by the interests of justice; (iv) Inherent powers are to be exercised where specific provision does not meet the necessities of the case.V.B.

By this appeal, the appellant impugned the judgment and decree of the Additional District Judge, Ludhiana, declining the petition of the appellant for restitution of conjugal rights under the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter called the 'Act'). 2. The appellant claimed, she and the respondent were Hindus and married at Ludhiana on December 22, 1976, according to Hindu rites. A daughter was born on July 21, 1978. The appellant admitted in her replication that she was married to Girdhari Lal Wadhwa, entered into a compromise with him on January 12, 1976 in criminal proceedings, and alleged that as per her knowledge and belief he died on November 30, 1976. She claimed, that she was known and believed to be widow on December 22, 1976. 3. The respondent refused the claim of the appellant. The marriage, birth of the child and the relationship of husband and wife were denied. The appellant was asserted to be the legally wedded wife of Girdhari Lat Wadhwa son of Ram Lal with whom she went to Delhi in terms of the compromise dated January 12, 1976. Girdhari Lal Wadhwa was said to have died on March 24, 1982. It was further averred that the appellant claimed herself to be widow on November 30, 1976 per her version set up in judicial proceedings on October 29, 1985. The appellant was stated to be having a living spouse and subsisting marriage on the alleged date of her marriage with the respondent i.e. on December 22, 1976, and hence the alleged marriage with the respondent was void. 4. The trial Court found that no marriage was solemnized between the parties. Even otherwise on December 22, 1976, i.e. the date of alleged marriage, the appellant had a living spouse and subsisting marriage. The petition for restitution of conjugal rights was dismissed. 5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record. The counsel for the appellant only challenged the findings of the trial Court stated above i.e. with respect to the validity of marriage as well as solemnisation of marriage. 6. It was contended that the findings recorded by the trial Court are against the facts proved. There was no proper appreciation of the evidence. The Court erroneously disbelieved the claim set up by the appellant and relied upon that of the respondent. The reasoning adopted by the trial Court for inferring the marriage as void and no solemnisation having taken place cannot be sustained. 7. It was contended that the trial Court failed to take into consideration the undisputed facts while appreciating the evidence, i.e. that the respondent was an advocate, his clerk was the material uncle of the appellant, and she claimed herself to be an issueless widow on the date of marriage. The appellant was allured by the respondent to marry him. only after he himself got fully satisfied withVeena Rani vs Jagdish Mitter Malhan on 24 April, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128000/ 1respect to the death of Girdhari Lal Wadhwa, her husband. 8. It was contended that the appellant stayed in the house of the respondent for seven years and a female child was born to them within two years of their marriage. They lived together as husband and wife. They made known their relationship to the people. The trial Court failed to raise the legal presumption with respect to the validity of marriage because of their living together as husband and wife for a long time. It was contended that in view of the admitted facts, the solemnisation of marriage should be presumed. 9. Lastly, it was urged that the trial Court erroneously relied on an inadmissible evidence of First Information Report and death certificate produced by the respondent in spite of the fact that the same were not proved on the record in accordance with the Evidence Act. The appellant urged that the respondent was estopped from denying the marriage and giving of birth to a female child by her from him in view of the above facts. It was further submitted that the ocular evidence brought on the record corroborated the submissions made by the counsel. 10. The counsel for the appellant in order to support his submissions relied on Badri Prasad v. Dy. Director of Consolidation and Ors., AIR 1978 SC 1557, Smt. Bina Agarwal v. Mahesh Chandra Agarwal and Anr., 1983 HLR 487 and Guru Dull Singh and Ors. v. Durga Devi and Anr., AIR 1966 Jammu and Kashmir 75, and Smt. Rajdei v. Lautan and Anr., AIR 1980 Allahabad 109. 11. The institution of marriage is a recognised time old institution. It was essential and necessary for the civilised human society. The peace clergy personalities and legislators have been bringing about the changes necessary in the institution. The marriage has been centre of activity religiously, legally and for the human biological urges. The marriages were governed by pre-determined rules worked out by the saints, philosphers, law givers, Courts as well as the legislatures. The laws and the customs varried from time to time, place to place, community to community etc. 12. The status of a husband and a wife was considered to be religious and one of the most pious relationships. According to various schools of thought life demanded certain minimum civilized existence. The marriage was an institution wherein the parties to it consolidated their social and economic gains and passed those on to their progeny. The marriage builds the dynastic units. Marriages are arranged with great solemnity and with certain ceremonies recognised by custom are by law. A healthy, and happy marriage provides a good progeny which would prove an asset to the nation. According to the ancient philosophy marriage was considered to be a spiritual ideal for the guidance of the believers. Marriage was one of the means to check immorality and further save the women from exploitation. It has psychological, biological, civil and human considerations. It was one of the essential institutions in order to protect the progeny, who would be the future citizens of the country. 13. Hindu idea of marriage has always involved the creation of permanent tie irrespective of the fact how it came into being. Hindus had been treating the marriage as a sacrosanct act. In order to bring about the marriage, in view of the sacrosanctity attached to it, various ceremonies were provided by the Hindu philosphers in order to attain the status of husband and wife and keeping the same at theVeena Rani vs Jagdish Mitter Malhan on 24 April, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128000/ 2highest pedestal. The marriage carried along with it divine blessings and it was known that peace and prosperity used to dwell in the house where female members received due respect and honour. It was observed by various jurists and psychologists that woman by nature is weak and is unable to bear the termoils of the world and marriage is status fulfilling, an irrevocable intention of living together, sharing the experiences of life, taking the wear and tear of life jointly. The public used to maintain and respect the status of married life. It bore a legal condition of status. The termination of marriage was unknown except in a few and a particular class of people and conditions. Marriage was considered to be essential for spiritual welfare. In the ancient society monogamy was considered a virtue in spite of the fact that in some class of people and under certain circumstances polygamy was permissible. 14. With the passage of time changes in social conditions, the reforms suggested by various saints, philosophers, law givers. Courts as well as the legislatures and the influence of the Western Society have eroded the concept of Hindu marriage being a sacrosanct. Resultantly, the marriage is now considered partly as a sancrosanct and partly as a contract. Monogamy has been considered to be decorous in view of the fact that the females are being considered as equals. 15. The marriage law was codified in 1955 and was known as Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. By the Act, all the rules of the law of marriage applicable to Hindus whether by virtue of texts, rules of Hindu law, usage, custom having force of law were abrogated. The concept of monogamy was highlighted and polygamy was frowned at. The status of the institution of marriage was kept intact in spite of the fact that indissolubility of the matrimonial relationship was loosened. Certain bars were embedded in the Act, violation of which results in a marriage being void ab initio. Importance of the ceremonies for bringing about a legal valid marriage whether under custom of the parties or under the Act were given due consideration and were almost kept intact. An attempt was made in the Hindu Marriage Act that the marriage should be considered to be in dissolvable except in the circumstances provided by the Act which have been enumerated keeping in view the interest of the society. It was observed that all attempts should be made to keep the relationship going. The split should be avoided. An attempt should be made to keep the traditions handed down by our ancestors to maintain the tie of husband and wife. Nothing should be done to impair the relationship. All attempts should be made to endure it. 16. The Hindu Marriage Act provided the bars and the rituals to be observed for bringing about a marriage, the grounds for its dissolution and the procedure for the same. It further provided in what set of circumstances a marriage can be said to be void ab initio. Special jurisdiction has been conferred in the matrimonial disputes. Bigamous marriage has been treated as void marriage. It was further provided that any judgment of the matrimonial Court determining the status of the parties shall be a judgment in rem. Section 7 of the Act envisaged that marriage amongst the Hindus can be performed by Saptapadi and this it the only form which has been accepted to be legal and valid form of marriage though special customs for performing a valid marriage amongst various class of people were kept in tact. Undergoing of ceremonies provided by Section 7 or custom of either party to it were made mandatory before the status of husband and wife could be conferred upon a person.

Niggard and bereft of details, pithily and precisely the relevant facts which are absolutely necessary and germane for the disposal of this Civil Miscellaneous Second Appeal could be portrayed thus: The appellant is the husband of the respondent herein. Their marriage was solemnized on 11.06.1986. They have no issues. While so, the husband filed H.M.O.P.No.12 of 1992 in the Sub Court, Tanjore, seeking divorce by invoking Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 so to say on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The wife filed H.M.O.P.No.34 of 1992 for restitution of conjugal rights. 4. The gist and kernel of the allegations of the husband as against the wife is that she refused to cooperate with the husband for consummating the marriage by submitting herself to sexual intercourse with him and she with effect from 05.11.1989 started living separately from the husband. 5. Per contra, denying and refuting, challenging and impugning the allegations made by the husband, the wife would contend that the husband having been dissatisfied with the wife's failure to comply with his demand for dowry, started harassing her physically and mentally and that he only started living separately from her. 6. During the joint enquiry, the husband examined himself as P.W.1 along with P.W.2 andthe wife examined himself as R.W.1 along with R.W.2. No document was marked on either side. 7. Ultimately, the trial Court granted divorce and consequently dismissed the petition for restitution of conjugal rights. 8. Being aggrieved by such Judgment and decree of the trial Court, the wife filed two appeals in H.M.C.M.A.Nos.9 and 10 of 1993 before the District Court, Tanjore. The first appellate Court set aside the Judgment and decree of divorce and dismissed both the applications. 9. Being dissatisfied with the Judgment and decree of the first appellate Court, the husband filed this Civil Miscellaneous Second appeal on the following main grounds: The first appellate Court without any sound reason reversed the decree of divorce. The first appellate Court having dismissed the application for restitution of conjugal rights filed by the wife should have confirmed the decree of divorce. The first appellate Court failed to appreciate that the husband took steps to resume cohabitation with the wife, still she refused to respond. The first appellate Court without considering the evidence of P.W.2 and the circumstances involved in this case including the conduct of the wife, wrongly held that the case of the husband was not believable as there was no medical evidence in favour of the plea of the husband relating to his plea of non-consummation of the marriage. Accordingly he prayed for setting aside the order of the first appellate Court in reversing the decree of divorce granted by the trial Court and for restoring the decree of divorce. 10. Heard both sides.D.Rajendran vs R.Dhanalaxmi on 23 January, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/755237/ 211. At the time of admitting this second appeal, the following substantial questions of law were framed: (1) Whether the finding of the lower Appellate Court are vitiated by its failure to draw the legal inferences on the conduct of the respondent and that the respondent's allegations of dowry harassment was not proved? (2) Whether the lower appellate Court is right in placing the burden upon the husband to prove that the marriage is not consummated, especially when there is no issues? (3) Whether the lower appellate Court is right in not taking the adverse inference against the respondent when she did not come forward to be examined by a Medical Expert? (4) Whether the findings of the lower appellate Court vitiated by its failure to consider the pleadings and evidence and whether a case has been made out for divorce under Section 13(i)(a) and (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act? 12. The substantial questions of law are taken together for discussion as they are interlinked with each other. 13. The unassailable facts are that the husband filed H.M.O.P.No.12 of 1992 for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion, whereas the wife filed H.M.O.P.No.34 of 1992 for restitution of conjugal rights. 14. In this case, it is just and necessary to refer to the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court concerning the fact as to what would constitute cruelty as it is obvious and axiomatic that there is no precise definition of cruelty in the Hindu Marriage Act. The following decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court could fruitfully be cited: (i) Savitri Pandey v. Prem Chandra Pandey reported in (2002) 2 Supreme Court Cases 73. An excerpt from it, would run thus: ""6. Treating the petitioner with cruelty is a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)( i-a ) of the Act. Cruelty has not been defined under the Act but in relation to matrimonial matters it is contemplated as a conduct of such type which endangers the living of the petitioner with the respondent. Cruelty consists of acts which are dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty for the purpose of the Act means where one spouse has so treated the other and manifested such feelings towards her or him as to have inflicted bodily injury, or to have caused reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, suffering or to have injured health. Cruelty may be physical or mental. Mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse which causes mental suffering or fear to the matrimonial life of the other. ""Cruelty"", therefore, pos tulates a treatment of the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party. Cruelty, however, has to be distinguished from the ordinary wear and tear of family life. It cannot be decided on the basis of the sensitivity of the petitioner and has to be adjudged on the basis of the course of conduct which would, in general, be dangerous for a spouse to live with theD.Rajendran vs R.Dhanalaxmi on 23 January, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/755237/ 3","['28', '13', '10']"

Gokhale, J. 1. This Family Court Appeal by the appellant wife seeks to challenge the judgment and order dated 11th June 2001 passed by a learned Judge of the Family Court at Bandra, Mumbai in Misc. Application No. 47 of 1998 rejecting the same. The Misc. Application decided by the Family Court arose as a result of a remand to that Court by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 4th September 1997 passed in Civil Appeal No. 126 of 1993 directing the Family Court to decide the limited issue with respect to the claim made by the appellant wife under section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 concerning the return of ornaments and other articles. This judgment of the Apex Court is in the case of Balkrishna Kadam v. Sangeeta Kadam is reported in AIR 1997 SCC 3562. These ornaments and articles were claimed by the appellant in her written statement to M.J. Petition No. 662 of 1982 filed by the respondent husband seeking divorce. 2. The short facts leading to this appeal are as follows:- The appellant and the respondent were married on 11th May 1969 as per the Hindu Vedic Rites in Mumbai. It appears that within a few months after the marriage, disputes developed between the parties on various aspects. However, to put it shortly, initially the disputes appear to have started because of the appellant wife and her mother-in-law not getting along well with each other. Whereas it is the case of the appellant wife that the mother-in-law did not treat her well and that the respondent husband and the mother-in-law used to ill treat, abuse and assault the appellant. On the other hand, it was the case of the respondent husband that it was the appellant wife who ill treated her mother-in-law. It also appears that the accommodation, wherein the parties lived initially at Ghodapdev in Central Mumbai, was a very small one. The parties later on shifted to an apartment at Santacruz and, though the same was in the name of the respondent husband, there is a controversy as to who made the principal contribution towards the purchase of the flat. The grievance of the appellant wife is further that the respondent had taken to drinking and later on developed illicit relations with another lady. The appellant was initially working as a Comptist in Philips (India) Ltd. with a good salary and has hence retired there from, whereas the respondent husband was in the ministerial cadre in the Home Department of the State of Maharashtra and subsequently retired as Deputy Secretary. It is not disputed that the appellant wife at all material times had a far better salary than the respondent husband. The parties gave birth to three children during the course of their unhappy marital life, i.e. a son named Rajesh born on 21st April 1970, a daughter named Unnati born on 6th December 1979 and a son named Suprasad born on 5th July 1981. It appears that after the birth of the first child, the appellant wife went away and stayed at another flat at Vikhroli only to return after a few years. During this turbulent relationship between the two, the three children all throughout remained with their mother.Sangeeta B. Kadam vs Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam on 13 January, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1973190/ 13. The respondent husband filed M.J. Petition No. 662 of 1982 in the City Civil Court at Mumbai seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty. The appellant wife contested this petition and in the written statement filed by her to this M.J. Petition, she claimed that she had left behind her ornaments of gold and silver and various household furniture and articles in the matrimonial home. It is material to note that the respondent husband did not file any counter to these averments. The aforesaid averments at the end of para 17 of her written statement read as follows:- ""17. ... The Respondent states that all ornaments and other articles which are purchased by the Respondent from her own earning are lying with the Petitioner in his flat at Santacruz. Hereto annexed and marked Exh.""A"" is the list of the ornaments of all types, household articles including freeze, T.V., cooker etc. and show pieces, lying in the Petitioner's house at Santacruz and which are purchased by the Respondent from her own earnings. The Respondent states that everything mentioned in Ex. ""A"" belongs to the Respondent as those items are purchased by the Respondent from her earnings. The Respondent states that this Hon'ble Court be pleased to order the Petitioner to handover those articles mentioned in ""A"" to the Respondent. The Respondent states that the keys of the locker are also with the Petitioner and that can be found from the averments made in para No. 24 of the Petition. The Respondent states that if at all the Respondent had taken the keys of the locker, the Respondent does not understand as to how the Petitioner opened the locker thereafter."" 4.

Bhattacharjee, J. 1. A husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights was not only opposed by the wife but was countered with a claim for dissolution of the marriage on the ground of cruelty committed by the husband. Section 23A of the Hindu Marriage Act, as inserted by the Amendment Act of 1976, has now expressly permitted such counter claim providing that - ""in any proceeding for restitution of conjugal rights, the respondent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion, but also make a counterclaim for any relief under this Act on that ground; and if the petitioner's adultery, cruelty_ or desertion is proved, the Court may give to the respondent any relief under this Act to which he or she would have been entitled if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief on that ground."" 2. This section, to our mind, has again demonstrated carelessness and also ""slovenliness in drafting"" which, as pointed out by Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills, ""is becoming rather common these days."" The spouse proceeded against for the restitution of conjugal rights is obviously entitled to oppose the claim not only on the ground of the petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion, but also on any other ground on which a marriage may be dissolved under Section 13 of the Act, e.g. incurably of unsound mind or suffering from leprosy in a virulent and incurable form or from veneral disease in a communicable form and the like. And if a spouse can do so, it is difficult to understand as to why he or she would not be entitled to make a counter-claim for divorce on any such ground other than the three specified in Section 23A, namely, adultery, cruelty or desertion. This point, however, need not detain us as here the counter-claim of the wife for dissolution of marriage was on the ground of cruelty by the husband. 3. The trial Court decreed the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights and dismissed the wife's counter-claim for divorce. On appeal to this Court, the decision of the trial Court was completely overturned and a Division Bench of this Court, while dismissing the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights, decreed the wife's counterclaim for divorce and also granted the wife permanent alimony at the rate of Rs. 300/-per month. 4. In her written statement in the main lis, the wife-respondent made a prayer for return of certain articles specified in the schedule thereto, but the trial Judge having decreed the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights, did not make any order in respect of that prayer. The Division Bench on appeal, after allowing the appeal and decreeing divorce, remanded the case of the wife for return of the articles to the trial Court for fresh adjudication under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the evidence on record and on further evidence to be adduced by the parties, but made it clear that it was expressing ""no opinion whether or not the claim of the appellant in respect of the items of property or ornaments mentioned in the Schedule to her written statement can beSibnath Mukhopadhyay vs Sunita Mukhopadhyay ... on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/710280/ 1entertained under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act."" 5. The trial Judge, after remand, treated the matter as ""a proceeding under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act"" and after recording evidence and hearing the parties, allowed the claim of the wife holding that she was ""entitled to get back from the petitioner (husband) 1 necklace, 8 pieces of Bangles, 1 Bala, 1 pair Ear-Rings, all of gold, or 8 Bharies of gold in lieu thereof, 4 Benarasi Sarees, 1 big plate of stainless steel, 1 small dish of stainless steel and 1 glass of stainless steel"" and directed the petitioner-husband to return the aforesaid articles to the wife-respondent. Being aggrieved, the petitioner-husband has filed this appeal. 6. If this was, as the trial Court thought it to be, a separate proceeding under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, then we are afraid that no appeal could lie against any order passed under thatsection. As Section 28 of the Act makes it clear, all decrees passed under the Act, being decrees for restitution of conjugal rights, of nullity of marriage, of judicial separation and of divorce, are appealable under Section 28(1) and as it would be clear from Section 28(2), the only orders under the Hindu Marriage Act that are appealable are orders for permanent alimony under Section 25 and post-decretal orders for custody, maintenance and education of minor children. Therefore, if Section 27 contemplates a separate proceeding dehors a decree under the Act, an order thereunder would not be appealable. Section 27 reads as hereunder : -- ""In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may make such provisions in the decree as it deems just and proper with respect to any property presented, at or about the time of marriage, which may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife."" 7. The section therefore at once makes it clear that the determination in accordance with the provisions of this section must take form in the shape of provisions in the decree and as part thereof and would be appealable as such. 8. Here in this case, the original petition of the husband for restitution of conjugal rights, numbered as Matrimonial Suit No. 66 of. 1977, was decreed by the trial Court and the counter-claim made therein by the wife for divorce was dismissed. On appeal by the wife to this Court, being AFOD No. 174 of 1979, A Division Bench allowed the appeal, reversed the j udgment and decree of the trial Court, dismissed the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights, decreed the wife's counter-claim for divorce, ordered grant of permanent alimony to the wife, but referred the claim of the wife for return of the articles back to the trial Court for fresh adjudication, obviously under the provisions of Rule 25 of Order 41 of the Civil P.C. by which matrimonial proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act are regulated because of Section 21 of the Act. Now that the trial Court has returned the evidence and its findings thereon, it would be for this Court to determine the appeal finally by disposing of the matter relating to the return of the articles which was remanded to the trial Court, the other matters, namely, the husband's claim for restitution and the wife's counter-claim for divorce having already been finally disposed of by the Division Bench by its Judgment dated 24th Aug., 1981.Sibnath Mukhopadhyay vs Sunita Mukhopadhyay ... on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/710280/ 29. As already noted, the finding of the trial Court after remand is that the wife is entitled to get back from the husband ""one necklace, eight pieces of Bangles, one Bala, one pair of Ear-Rings, all of gold, or eight Bharies gold in lieu thereof, four Banarasi sarees. . . . ., one big plate of stainless steel, one small dish of stainless steel and one glass of stainless steel"" and the husband has been ""directed to return the abovementioned articles"" to the wife within two months from the date of the order. This order has, however, been stayed by this Court till the disposal of this appeal on the husband's handing over four Fixed Deposit Certificates amounting in all to Rs. 20,000/- as security with the Registrar, Appellate Side, of this Court. 10. But both the parties have now filed before us a joint petition for compromise signed by them and their respective lawyers praying that the matter be disposed of on the terms and conditions contained in the petition which are briefly as hereunder, namely, that the husband has agreed to pay to the wife a sum of Rs. 15,000/- only in full and final satisfaction of her claim for return of the articles specified in the order of the trial Court and has in fact handed over to the wife a Bank Draft of that amount, that the wife having now been employed and earning her livelihood is relinquishing and agreeing not toenforce her right to thepermanent alimony of Rs. 300/- per month payable by the husband, that the husband will be entitled to withdraw the Fixed Deposit Certificate deposited with the Registrar as security in accordance with the order of stay as aforesaid and that the parties would bear their respective costs. We have now been asked to record this accord or compromise and to dispose of the appeal in accordance therewith. 11. The approach of a Court to any agreement or compromise between the parties to the litigation must be, to quote the oft quoted Latin maxim, utres magis valeat quam pereat, i.e., let it flourish and not perish. Interest Republicae being finis litium, and lawful compromise being the most descent burial for all lis with no scope for further agitation in the higher Courts, the Court must record a compromise wherever and whenever it can and should refuse to do so only when it cannot but. The terms of the compromise, however, must, as expressly provided in Order 23, Rule 3 of the Civil P.C. be lawful and, in our view, nothing unlawful can be gleaned from the terms providing that the party shall bear their respective costs and that now that the appeal is going to be disposed of, the appellant-husband would be entitled to withdraw the Security Deposit made in compliance with the order granted by this Court staying the execution of the impugned order. The condition providing that the wife would not enforce but would relinquish her right to the amount of permanent alimony granted by this Court is also quite lawful as it is the wife's own admission in the petition that she is now in a position to earn her livelihood and to support herself and there is thus ""a change in the circumstances"" within the meaning of Section 25(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act which would justify a rescission of the order. To satisfy ourselves further, we also directed the parties to appear before us in person and the wife has reiterated before us what she has stated in the compromise petition. 12. We, however, have our doubts as to whether all the articles which the wife claimed and which the trial Judge has directed the husband to return back to the wife could be the subject matter of an order under Section 27, Hindu Marriage Act. As quoted hereinbefore the Section on its express terms would apply to such property only which -- (a) has been ""presented at or about the time of marriage"" and (b) ""may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife"". It is common knowledge that properties presented at or about the time of the marriage may belong to the bride only or theSibnath Mukhopadhyay vs Sunita Mukhopadhyay ... on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/710280/ 3","['23','13', '21', '28', '25', '27']"

This is defendant's appeal. The respondents filed O.S. No. 155 of 1978 in the Court of the Munsiff, Basavakalyan, under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as H.A. & M. Act) claiming maintenance from the defendant. 2. The basic facts in the plaint are :- Respondent-1-plaintiff-1 is the married wife of the defendant-appellant and Respondent-2 is the minor daughter of plaintiff-1 and the defendant. 3. The defendant contended that he had married one Sarjabai in 1964 and after her death, he married one Ranjanabai in the year 1967. As she had not yet attained puberty, she was not brought home. Plaintiff-1 was acquainted with him. Intimacy developed between them and the villagers insisted that he must marry plaintiff-1. He married her according to customary ceremonies and rites. Plaintiff-2 is his daughter by plaintiff-1. In view of the fact that his marriage with plaintiff-1 had taken place during the subsistence of the marriage between him and Ranjanabai during her life (Ranjanabai is still alive), his marriage with plaintiff-1 is void under Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as.H.M. Act). Hence plaintiff-1 is not entitled to be maintained by him as of right and the suit filed by her is not maintainable. 4. The Trial Court has recorded a finding, after appreciating the evidence, that the defendant had established that he had married Ranjanabai after the death of Sarjabai and during the subsistence of that marriage he had married plaintiff-1 and therefore the marriage between plaintiff-1 and the defendant is void. Thereafter, it has proceeded to apply the law as laid down in C. Obula Konda Reddy -v.- C. Pedda Venkata Lakshamma and hold that the suit was maintainable It has granted Rs. 100/- per month for maintenance of plaintiff-1 and Rs. 45/-towards maintenance of plaintiff-2. The defendant preferred R. A. No. 79 of 1981 and the plaintiffs preferred R.A. No. 15 of 1982, in the Court of the Civil Judge, Bidar. In their appeal, the plaintiffs claimed enhancement of maintenance. In his appeal the defendant contended that the decree passed by the Trial Court was not sustainable in law. The lower appellate Court has disposed of the appeals, without recording any finding on the question whether the defendant had married plaintiff-1 in contravention of Section 5(i) of the H.M. Act. According to the lower appellate Court even if the marriage is considered to be void, plaintiffs have to succeed in view of C. Obula Konda Reddy's case1. It has allowed the appeal of the plaintiffs and enhanced the maintenance of plaintiff-1 to Rs. 125/- per month and that of plaintiff-2 to Rs. 75/- per month. R.A. No. 79 of 1981 filed by the defendant has been dismissed. 5. This second appeal is directed against the said judgments and decrees. It has been admitted for consideration of the following substantial questions of law, as formulated at the time of admission:Kishan vs Sakharabai on 5 August, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257054/ 11) Whether in view of plaintiff-1's case that she was married to defendant some ten years before the institution of the suit O S No. 155/1978, during the lifetime of the second wife of the defendant, would she be a Hindu wife within the meaning of Section 18(1) and (2) of the Hindu Adoption end Maintenance Act ? 2) If she was married to the defendant during the life time of his second wife, would she be entitled to maintenance under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act ? 6. Sri M. Mahableshwar Goud, Learned Counsel for the appellant, submitted that the appeal is restricted to the claim of plaintiff-1 only and argued that it was the duty of the lower appellate Court to record a finding on the question whether plain tiff-1's marriage with the defendant was or was not hit by Section 5(i) of the H.M. Act. He urged that a direction be given for recording such a finding. He pointed out that in case such a finding is recorded in favour of the plaintiffs, their suit under Section 18 of the H.A. & M.Act would be maintainable and if not it may not be maintainable. 7. Sri M. Ram Bhat, appearing for respondents-plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that even if the marriage of plaintiff-1 is hit by Section 5(i) of the H.M. Act, this suit is maintainable as held in C. Obula Konda Reddy's1 case and also in Shantaram Tukaram Patil and anr. -v.- Smt. Dagubai Tukaram Patil and ors. . 8. The arguments urged by the Counsel call for interpretation of Sections 5, 11 and 25 of the H.M. Act, on the aspect whether Section 25 of the Act confers a right on plaintiff-1 even if the marriage of plaintiff-1 with the defendant is declared void in view of Section 5(i) of the H.M. Act. This Court felt that the decision might lead to consequence of considerable impact. Therefore, with the consent of Sri M. Mahableshwar Goud and Sri M. Ram Bhat, this Court invited the members of the Bar who were interested to address arguments and to participate in this appeal. Sri V. Krishna Murthy, Senior Advocate and Sri N.A. Mandgi, Advocate, devoted part of their busy time in studying various aspects pertaining to this question and ably argued and assisted the Court. The gist of their arguments will be shortly narrated. But, before proceeding to do so, this Court wishes to place on record its deep appreciation of the assistance rendered by them. 9. The argument of Sri V. Krishna Murthy is based on the principle that in the case of a wife pre-existing right to claim and receive maintenance is a must in law. He argued that when Section 5 of H.M. Act declares the marriage between plaintiff-1 and the defendant void, the marriage is ipso jure void. Hence, even if the requisite Hindu ceremonies had been performed, the marriage became non-est and did not secure legal status of a wife to plaintiff 1 and she had no right to claim and receive maintenance. He further argued proceeding on these lines, that such a right must be existing till a decree under the provisions of H.M. Act is passed and because of the decree so passed the status as wife must get extinguished and then only the ingredients of Section 25 of the H.M. Act would be satisfied. According to him, the use of the words ""husband and wife"" in Section 25 of the H.M. Act supported this argument and conclusion and therefore on a decree being passed in a petition under Section 11 of the H.M. Act, the so-called wife would not be entitled to claim and receive maintenance. When that is so, no question of such a so called wife being conferred with a right to claim and receive maintenance under Section 25 of the H.M. Act can arise and muchless inKishan vs Sakharabai on 5 August, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257054/ 2any other proceeding or suit. He strongly relied or A.P.K. Narayanaswami Reddiar -v.- Padmanabhan (minor) and Ors. and disagreed with the views expressed in the decisions in Dayal Singh -v.- Bhajan Kaur Govindrao Ranoji Musale -v.- Sou. Anandibai and Anr. Smt. Rajeshbai and Ors. -v.- Smt. Shantabai and Shantaram Tukaram Patil and ors. It may be stated here that he is supported by the decision in A P.K. Narayanaswami Reddiar. 10. Sri N.A. Mandgi, learned Counsel, argued that H-A. & M.Act codifies the Hindu law on Adoption and Maintenance and makes the provisions in that Act over-ride any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, and any other law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, by stating so in Section 4 of H.A. & M.Act. Therefore, Section 18 of the H.A. & M. Act. would necessarily mean that only a wife who continues to have that legal status has the right to claim and receive maintenance provided she satisfies the conditions laid down therein. He made it clear by stating that Section 18 of the H.A. & M.Act does not permit a divorced wife or a wife whose marriage has been annulled by a decree of nullity or declared void by a decree of nullity to claim and receive maintenance. According to Sri N.A. Mandgi, the H.M. Act codifies the law on Hindu Marriage and therefore deals with all aspects about the Hindu Marriage and its incidents. His exposition is that Section 25 of the H.M.Act not only deals with passing of all the decrees under the provisions of the Act, but also makes provision regarding the incidents arising on the passing of the decrees. The words ""any decree"" occurring in Section 25 of the H.M.Act cannot be given a restricted meaning so as to exclude a decree of nullity either contemplated under Section 11 or Section 12 of the H.M.Act. Plain reading of Section 25 of the H.M.Act, according to him shows that at the time of passing a decree or at any time subsequent thereto, the spouse concerned (stated as husband or wife in the Act) is given a right to make an application claiming maintenance, for adjudication by the Court exercising jurisdiction under that Act (hereinafter referred to as Matrimonial Court). Sri N.A. Mandgi's argument further is that this is a special provision in the Act. It provides for a specific right which arises under the conditions enumerated in the provision, the remedy and the forum to grant relief. When that is so, such a spouse has to claim such a relief in accordance with the provisions of Section 25 of the H.M. Act and it is not open to such spouse to claim maintenance in any other proceeding even if the question of declaring the marriage void in view of Section 5(i) of the H.M. Act arises for consideration in that proceeding i.e., in the ordinary Court. 11. One more aspect is available for consideration as expressed by V B. Raju, J. in State of Gujarat -v.- Chandramani Shanker Jadhavlal Sanghvi and ors. . This decision is cited in Dayal Singh's case4 and Narayanaswami Reddiar's case8, in support of the proposition that Section 25 of the H.M. Act applies to all actions and proceedings under the Act, whether they be for judicial separation or dissolution of marriage or for decree of nullity. Thorough reading of this decision shows that if an application is given subsequent to the passing of the decree for divorce or decree of nullity annulling the marriage or a decree of nullity declaring the marriage void, an order for payment of alimony would be outside the scope of Section 25 of the H. M. Act, as to be entitled to maintenance even after a decree under the provisions of the H.M. Act a wife has to have existing legal status as a wife. Therefore, maintenance under Section 25 of the H.M. Act can in law be granted only on the passing of a decree for judicial separation or for restitution of conjugal rights. It may be remembered in this connection that the aspect argued by Sri V. Krishnamurthy is slightly different inasmuch as it isKishan vs Sakharabai on 5 August, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1257054/ 3","['4', '18', '12', '5', '11', '25']"

This revision petition is filed by respondent in Marriage O.P.No.146 of 1997, on the file of Family Court at Pondicherry. 2. Petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed by the husband, hereinafter called the respondent, on 29.9.1997. In fact, the marriage between petitioner and respondent took place only on 4.9.1997, i.e., within a few days of marriage, petition for divorce was filed. Along with that petition, respondent did not file an application seeking leave of the Court to entertain the application. But, such an application was filed on 8.10.1997. In that application under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, he alleged certain reasons and also mentioned the hardship and injury which he will suffer if he has to wait for a period of one year from the date of marriage. Both the main petition for divorce as well as the I.A. for exemption under Section 14(1) of the Act were numbered and summons were also issued to the petitioner by order of Court on 27.10.1997. 3. In this revision, petitioner challenges the procedure followed by the Family Court in issuing summons when the application under Section 14(1) of the Act was not ordered, and it is further contended that without grant of leave in I.A., the main petition ought not to have been numbered. It is the further case of the petitioner that when the Statute prohibits entertaining of the petition for divorce for a period of one year from the date of marriage, without grant of leave, respondent is not entitled even to institute the proceeding. It is the further case of petitioner that the bar under Sec. 14(1) of the Act is mandatory. 4. This revision is filed under Art. 227 of the Constitution of India, challenging the jurisdiction of the Family Court in entertaining the main petition for divorce. 5. When the matter came for admission, I ordered notice of motion and also granted interim stay of further proceedings before the Family Court. After receipt of notice through Court, respondent also entered appearance through Counsel. 6. Learned counsel for petitioner, at the time of arguments, submitted that the petition for divorce is premature, and it could be cured only by an order of Court when leave is granted, and only after such an Order is passed, respondent can get a cause of action to institute a petition for divorce. It is the contention of learned counsel that such an order must precede the institution, and that is a condition precedent. Otherwise, a petition for divorce can be entertained only after a period of one year. 7. As against the said contention, learned counsel for respondent submitted that the petition under Section 14(1) read with Proviso is only directory and non-compliance of the said Section will not entail dismissal of the petition. If at all leave is required, that defect also can be cured by applyingIndumathi vs Krishnamurthy on 20 July, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1710014/ 1Proviso to Sec. 14(1) of the Act. Learned counsel submitted that institution of petition for divorce is not a bar, and the wording in Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act only deals with entertaining of the petition which means that the Court shall not enter into the merits of the case till the expiry of one year. Learned counsel further submitted that on a proper reading of Proviso to Sec. 14(1) it will be clear that even the merits could be gone into before the expiry of one year, and if it is ultimately found that divorce a could be granted, that shall take effect only after one year from the date of marriage. Various other provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act were also brought to my notice by learned counsel to contend that institution of such a proceeding is never prohibited under the Hindu Marriage Act. Learned counsel submitted that the purpose of fixing this period of one year is intended only for the purpose of bringing about reconcilement between the parties, if possible. There is no purpose in prohibiting the respondent from instituting the proceeding and asking to wait for one year before instituting a proceeding. 8. None of the learned counsel for both parties brought to my notice any decision of this Court except the one reported in Meganatha Nayagar v. Shrimathi Susheela, . The applicability of this decision will be considered in a later portion of this Order. 9. Before going to the question of law, it is better to extract Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It reads thus:- ""14. No petition far divorce to be presented within three years of marriage- Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, it shall not be competent for any Court to entertain any petition for dissolution of a marriage by a decree of divorce, unless at the date of the presentation of the petition one year has elapsed since the date of the marriage: Provided that the Court may, upon application made to it in accordance with such rules as may be made by the High Court in that behalf, allow a petition to be presented before one year has elapsed since the date of the marriage on the ground that the case is one of exceptional hardship to the petitioner or of exceptional depravity on the part of the respondent, but, if it appears to the Court at the hearing of the petition that the petitioner obtained leave to present the petition by any misrepresentation or concealment of the nature of the case, the Court may, if it pronounces a decree, do so subject to the condition that the decree shall not have effect until after the expiry of one year from the date of the marriage or may dismiss the petition without prejudice to any petition which may be brought after the expiration of the said one year upon the same or substantially the same facts as those alleged in support of the petition so dismissed. (2) In disposing of any application under this section for leave to present a petition for divorce before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage, the Court shall have regard to the interests of any children of the marriage and to the question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said one year."" 10. In a recent judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in Martin & Harris Ltd. v. VIth Additional District Judge and others, , Their Lordships considered what is meant by the word 'entertained', 'institution', 'filing', etc., and what is the difference of these words in legal parlance.Indumathi vs Krishnamurthy on 20 July, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1710014/ 2That was a case where a landlord filed a petition for eviction of a tenant before expiry of three years from the date of its purchase. The eviction petition was filed under the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. Relevant portion of Section 21 of that Act reads thus:- ""21. Proceeding for release of building under occupation of tenant- (1) The prescribed authority may, on an application of the landlord in that behalf, order the eviction of a tenant from the building under tenancy or any specified pan thereof if it is satisfied that any of the following grounds exists namely (a) and (b) omitted. Provided that where the building was in occupation of a tenant since before its purchase by the landlord, such purchase being made after the commencement of this Act, no application shall be entertained on the grounds mentioned in clause (a) unless period of three years has elapsed since the dale of purchase and the landlord has given a notice in that behalf to the tenant not less than six months before such application, and such notice may be given even before the expiration of the aforesaid period of three years."" (Rest of the Section omitted as unnecessary). Commenting on the same, at page 743, Their Lordships held thus:- ""...The stage at which the Court has to consider whether grounds mentioned in clause (a) are made out by the plaintiff or not will be reached when the Court takes up the application for consideration on merits. It has to be kept in view that applications for possession filed under Section 21(1) of the Act are not placed admission before the prescribed authority. Once they are filed they are to be processed for being decided on merits after issuing notices to the parties concerned. Therefore, when the application reaches final hearing on merits, the authority has to sift the grounds on which the application is based and if it finds that the application is based, amongst others, on the grounds mentioned in clause (a), it has to ascertain whether three years period has expired since the date of the purchase of the property by the plaintiff/landlord and if the period of three years is found to have expired, then the grounds mentioned in clause (a) would become alive for consideration of the ""authority. If not, the said grounds would not be entertained for consideration. Thus, the word 'entertained' mentioned in the First Proviso to Section 21(1) in connection with grounds mentioned inclause (a) would necessarily mean entertaining the ground for consideration for the purpose of adjudication on merits and not at any stage prior thereto as tried to be submitted by learned Senior Counsel Shri Rao... ...."" (Italics supplied) And, finally, in para 10, Their Lordships, after following their earlier decisions, held thus:- ""Learned Senior Counsel Shri Rao for appellant invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case of Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan, for submitting that a decree without jurisdiction is a nullity and such an objection to it can be raised even in execution proceedings There cannot be any dispute on this legal proposition. However, the question is whether decree passed by the prescribed authority under Section 21(1)(a) of the Act can be said to be a nullity at all.

This is an appeal against the judgment and order dated the 22nd February, 1991 in Matrimonial Suit No. 6/1985 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 11th Court, Alipore, granting decree of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in favour of the petitioner- husband and against the wife on the ground of cruelty of the wife. The husband who is respondent herein filed the suit for divorce on the ground of desertion and cruelty. The parties are Sikh by religion and are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. They were married according to Sikh rites and ceremonies on or about 23rd January, 1970 at 2/3A, Panditiya Road, Calcutta-29. Their marriage was consummated and two sons were born in that wedlock, - one on 28th May, 1972 and the other on 17th September, 1974. Both the sons however have, by now, crossed their minority and have attained majority. At the time of the marriage the petitioner was in service in the Security Force as an Assistant Company Commander. It was a negotiated marriage. 2. It is the case of the petitioner-husband that after the marriage, the petitioner returned to the place of his posting at Doomdooma (Assam) and the wife refused to accompany him on several pleas and ultimately she went there, but she stayed there only for a period of two months and that as she did not like the service of the petitioner in the Force the petitioner-husband resigned from the Security Force in 1971 and took up civilian life, and came down to Calcutta and started living with his parents at 95A, Bangur Avenue, but as the wife maintained that she disliked living with in-laws and she did not live with the petitioner at his parents place for more than a week at a stretch; the petitioner joined the Western Indian Match Co. Ltd. as Security Officer in August, 1971 and was allotted residential quarters in the factory premises, but the wife had the idea that the job of a Security Officer was a job of Darwan and a sophisticated lady could not live in the Darwan's quarters; that however due to earnest request of the petitioner, the wife lived in the said quarters for a few days on occasions at intervals when she conceived for the first time after more than a year of the marriage; that in 1973 the wife joined B.Ed. Course at Shri Shikshayatan against the wishes of the petitioner and on the plea that the college was near her parents' house she lived mostly with her parents and she neglected her household and partial duties and lived with the petitioner rarely and also almost always, the petitioner had to cook and do domestic chores and she even did not allow the petitioner to spend nights in her parents' house; that as the wife did not like the petitioner's service as a Security Officer he resigned from the job in December, 1973 and rented a separate flat at 112, Bangur Avenue as the wife did not like to live with the in-laws; that the wife lived in the rented flat on rare occasions and by that time she conceived again and later in July, 1974 she left for her parent's place on health ground and during her pregnancy and even after the confinement the wife refused to come and live with the petitioner; that she took up a job of teacher against the wishes of the petitioner and that became an additional plea for her to refuse to come back; that the petitioner had in the meantime started a transport business and his avocation did not leave for him enough time to cook his own food, that the wife always misbehaved with the petitioner and she always usedSukhdev Kaur (Grewal) vs Ravinder Singh Grewal on 18 July, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/561465/ 1to say that she was not married to serve the petitioner's parents and she habitually insulted the petitioner as being an army brute; that the wife is a westernised lady with individualistic tastes and she hated living a docile domestic life confined within four walls, cooking food and .... for the family; that after the child birth the respondent persistently refused access to the petitioner and she was living with her parents and refused to live with him on one plea or the other and even refused to allow the petitioner to stay at her parent's place even for a single night; that the wife surreptitiously took up the job of the teacher in Shhri Sikshayatan against the wishes of the petitioner in or about January, 1976; that she lived in her parent's house and the repeated persuasion of the petitioner to bring her back failed; that the wife lived a free life behind the back of the petitioner and she made secret trips to different places including Thailand; that whenever she asked for money the petitioner paid; that she refused conjugal access to the petitioner on most occasions; that at long last when the petitioner held out that he would not live a separate life all through his life and would take away the children, the wife returned to the petitioner in or about December, 1982 and initially she lived with the petitioner's parents and subsequently a flat at 52/4, Bangur Avenue was hired by the petitioner and she lived there with the children till August, 1989, but during this period she always misbehaved with the petitioner and also refused conjugal access to the petitioner; that in the morning of the 20th August, 1983 the wife wanted to go to her parent's place to which the petitioner consented; that the wife did not return and the petitioner went to her parent's place in the next afternoon and quite unexpectedly he was subjected to abuses; that subsequently on or about the 20th August, 1983, the wife filed case No. Cr. 1346 of 1983 under Sections 406/403/420, I.P.C. in the Court of the learned S.D.J.M. at Barrackpore against the petitioner and his mother making wild and false allegations; that the wife examined herself on oath in the said Court on 1st September, 1989 when she repeated her allegations and also examined her brother; that upon the said complaint, the learned Court took congnizance under Section 420, I.P.C. against the petitioner-husband and issued process and also issued search warrants for recovery of goods and on the strength of the search warrants the police searched the petitioner's residence at 52/4, Bangur Avenue on the 2nd September, 1983 and seized and removed 21 items of goods including furniture, sewing machine, ceiling fans, refrigerator etc. and in fact all removable articles were seized and removed; that the police also searched the parent's place of the petitioner at 61, Bangur Avenue on the 2nd September, 1983 and seized and removed 19 items of gold and silver ornaments and cutleries in presence and on the identification of the respondent-wife; that by levelling false allegations and by obtaining search warrants and having the goods seized on false allegations the wife has committed cruelty; that the respondent filed a petition for maintenance under Section 125, Cr. P.C. on false allegations that the petitioner misbehaved with her and assaulted and abused her and also drove her out on the 6th June, 1974 etc.; that the respondent wife out of her free Will during the absence of the petitioner left the petitioner's residence on or about the 20th August, 1983 and has since then abandoned the petitioner and has voluntarily withdrawn from the society of the petitioner and thus deserted him without any reasonable cause and without the consent of the petitioner. The petitioner prayed for decree of divorce and for custody of the two children. It may however be mentioned here that the two children have since attained majority and therefore the question of custody does not now survive and has not been pressed also. 3. In her written statement the respondent-wife has denied all the material allegations of cruelty and desertion. Her case is that the petitioner resigned from the service in Security Force as well as fromSukhdev Kaur (Grewal) vs Ravinder Singh Grewal on 18 July, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/561465/ 2the post of Security Officer of the private company, of his own accord and the wife had no role in the matter. It is the contention of the wife in the written statement that in order to have higher education she joined B. Ed. Course at Shri Shikshayatan in 1982 and no question can arise regarding the wish or desire of the petitioner in the matter as the petitioner since June, 1974 cut off all relationship with the respondent wife and the children till December, 1982. She also denies the allegation that she did not discharge her household duties etc. It is stated in the written statement that the petitioner was in the regular habit of intoxication and whenever the wife used to protest, the petitioner used to become furious and even used to torture her and the minor sons and the petitioner created such circumstances which ultimately forced the wife to leave the matrimonial home on account of threat and torture on the part of the petitioner and it was the petitioner who resorted to all sorts of tactics so as to drive away the wife in order to lead a care-free life. It is also the case of the wife that she has been doing the job of teacher in Shri Shikshayatan for having her own livelihood in view of the utter neglect by the petitioner. It is also her case that the statements made in the complaint filed in the Court of the learned S.D.J.M., Barrackpore are correct. 4. The learned Trial Court on consideration of the pleadings and the evidence came to the finding that the ground of desertion was not attracted in the case and even the learned Lawyer for the petitioner also did not press the issue regarding desertion before the learned Trial Court and in the circumstances the learned Court held that there was no desertion by the wife for a continuous period of two years immediately proceeding from 1974 to 1982, covering nearly eight years, the spouses lived separate from one another, but that period cannot be taken into consideration in view of the fact that in 1982 the parties again started living together as husband and wife and continued their cohabitation upto the third week of August, 1983 when they again separated finally. Therefore the period of desertion will have to be computed from August, 1983 for the purpose of consideration whether the wife has deserted the petitioner, if at all, for the requisite period of two years before the suit for the divorce was filed by the husband. It may be mentioned here that the suit for the divorce was filed by the husband. It may be mentioned here that the suit for the divorce was filed on 2.7.1984 when one year of separation was not yet completed, computed from August, 1983. That is why the learned Trial Court held that the ground of desertion was not available to the petitioner-husband for seeking divorce in the suit. 5. The learned Trial Court has however granted the decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty committed by the wife. The learned Trial Court has taken notice of the fact that the appellant-wife filed the criminal case in the Court of the learned S.D.J.M., Barrackpore on 30.8.1983 against the petitioner-husband and his mother Smt. Ishwar Kaur under Sections 406/403/420, IPC alleging that the husband was a desperate type of man and had started leading a vicious life and was a drunkard and also threatened to kill her to about 9 p.m. on 21.8.1983 for which she was compelled to leave the house on the next morning with her two sons and that it was also alleged in the petition of complaint that the husband by making false representation persuaded the wife to make over a sum of Rs. 14,000/- to the landlady from whom the husband took a flat on a monthly rental basis and further induced the wife to make over to him another sum of Rs. 16,000/- which he never intended to return.

No. 262 of 1993 refusing to grant decree of divorce sought by the appellant/ husband on the ground of cruelty as contemplated by Clause (d) of Sub-section (1) of Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (""Act"" for short). 2. When this matter was initially called out we enquired with the parties to the appeal as to whether it was possible to reconcile their differences and start living together. However, we were informed that number of attempts were made by different benches from time to time but they could not bring about any settlement between the parties, with the result, we were left with no other alternative but to proceed with the hearing and decide the same in accordance with law. Factual Score 3. The factual score depicts that the parties to the petition got married on 31st October, 1979 under Special Marriage Act, 1954. The appellant is a Hindu whereas respondent is Christian by religion. Parties to the appeal have two sons from this wedlock. Elder son Vishal was born to them in the year 1981, and younger one Vipul was born in the year 1984. Both spouses are financially independent. Both of them are in service. 4. Both of them after marriage happily lived together. But after some time bickering started raising their head which ultimately, resulted in matrimonial litigation between the parties. The appellant/husband had filed petition for restitution of conjugal rights under the Hindu Marriage Act. The said petition; which was registered as P. A. No. 1069/1989; came to be withdrawn as the respondent/wife had furnished undertaking cum compromise admitting her mistake in filing false complaint with police, against appellant/husband on the advice of her sister, brother-in-law and sister-in-law alleging misbehaviour on his part and upon expressing her regrets for an act of threatening to commit suicide and thereby attempting to falsely implicate the appellant/ husband. The copy of the said undertaking cum compromise (Exh. 35) is on record. 5. It appears that after aforesaid compromise in the year 1989 the relationships between the parties had started showing some improvements but after some time it took a bad turn. The relations between the spouses became sour, which resulted in shooting allegations and counter allegations with character assassination of each other and went on to the extent of physical assault resulting in police complaints. 6. The appellant/husband initiated another matrimonial litigation and filed petition for divorce under Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act being P. A. No. 262 of 1993 which came to beAvinash Eknath Nikalje vs Sou. Leela Avinash Nikalje on 24 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1551143/ 1filed in the Family Court, Pune. On being noticed, the respondent/wife appeared in Family Court, filed her written statement. The parties were permitted to file their respective documents. They were asked to lead their oral evidence and examine their respective witnesses. The Family Court after full trial of the matrimonial dispute was pleased to refuse to grant divorce as sought by the appellant/husband. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid verdict of the Family Court, Pune, the original petitioner/husband preferred this appeal. That is how this appeal was placed before us for final hearing. The parties to the appeal were heard at length. Both of them took us through the rival pleadings including the evidence of the respective parties and tried their best to focus our attention to the misbehaviour of each other and tried to throw blame on each other for creating situation in which both of them are finding themselves in. 7. The law on the cruelty is now well-settled that though the word 'cruelty' has not been defined in the Act. 'Cruelty' contemplated under Clause (d) of Section 27(1) of the Special Marriage Act does not attract the old English doctrine of physical danger. It is similar to that as contemplated in Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955, After the amendment of 1976, 'cruelty' contemplated by Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act is a conduct of such type that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent or that it has become impossible for the spouses to live together. Similar is a concept of 'cruelty' in the Special Marriage Act. The concept of cruelty in both these legislations is identical, as such ruling available under the Hindu Marriage Act can be the good guide to decide cases arising out of the Special Marriage Act. This is now clear in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of V. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat, . On a review of the earlier Supreme Court decisions, right from the case of Dr. N. G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane, , the Supreme Court has laid down the legal position which now obtains after the amendment of 1976 to the Hindu Marriage Act. In N. Bhagat v. D. S. Bhagat (supra), the Supreme Court has observed, thus at page 437 (of JT (SC)), (at p. 717 of AIR) : ""17. Mental cruelty in Section 13(1)(ia) can broadly be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such mental pain and suffering as would make it not possible for that party to live with the other. In other words, mental cruelty must be of such ,a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together. The situation must be such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with the other party. It is not necessary to prove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to the health of the petitioner. While arriving at such conclusion, regard must be had to the social status, educational level of the parties, the society they move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living together in case they are already living apart and all other relevant facts and circumstances which it is neither possible nor desirable, to set out exhaustively. What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case. It is a matter to be determined in each case having regard to the facts and circumstances of that case. It is a case of accusations and allegations, regard must also be had to the context in which they were made.""Avinash Eknath Nikalje vs Sou. Leela Avinash Nikalje on 24 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1551143/ 28. The Apex Court recently in the case of S. Hanumantha Rao v. S. Ramani, laid down what would constitute cruelty. The Apex Court again in the case of G. V. N. Kameswara Rao v. G. Jabilli, 2002 AIR SCW 162 held that to constitute cruelty it need not be of such nature as causing reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful to the party to live with other party. The Apex Court held that having regard to the sanctity and importance of marriage in a community life, the Court should consider whether the conduct of the counter petitioner is such that it has become intolerable for the petitioner to suffer any longer and to live together is impossible, and then only the Court can find that there is a cruelty of the counter petitioner. The Apex Court in another judgment in Chetan Das v. Kamala Devi, has taken a view that to constitute cruelty there must be evidence in support of the averments made in the petition. 9. On the above canvas of law, it would be necessary to examine the averments made in the petition including the reply thereto. In the light of rival pleadings, the evidence of the parties will have to be appreciated so as to find out whether or not the husband has made out the case sought to be canvassed.

In view of this physical defect in the vagina, such lady would not be able to have satisfactorily sexual intercourse. She has no uterus.

The appellant and the respondent are husband and wife respectively. The appellant had filed aA. Viswanathan vs G. Lakshmi @ Seetha on 20 November, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1341139/ 1petition for dissolution of marriage between them by a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1) (i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Family Court, after comprehensively dealing with the matter, dismissed the petition holding that the respondent has not treated the petitioner with cruelty and rejected the appellant's prayer to dissolve the marriage which took place on 23.08.1992. The appellant, aggrieved by the judgment of the Family Court, has preferred the present appeal on various grounds. 3. The appellant's case in brief is as under: a. The appellant married the first respondent on 23.08.1992 according to Hindu rites and customs. Subsequently, the marriage was registered at Adyar Registrar's Office on 25.01.1993. Prior to this marriage, the appellant married one Shantha in the year 1961 and lived with her for 30 years. There was no issue out of the appellant's first wedlock and hence, the appellant and his first wife a three month old boy Sivakumar, by following due legal procedure of adoption on 02.11.1978. The said Shantha died in the year 1991. At the time of filing the petition, the adopted son was studying B.Com. The appellant's mother was also residing with them. After the death of his first wife, the present married the respondent herein. b. The second marriage life of the appellant was smooth till 1994 and thereafter, since early 1995, the respondent's attitude towards the appellant, his mother and son changed. In course of time, the respondent started beating the appellant and his son with whatever item she could lay her hands upon. She, at times, bit the appellant, spit on the face of the appellant, his mother and son. All of a sudden, during nights, she became hysterical, woke up the appellant and his son Sivakumar and without any reason wallop them. She also asked the appellant to get rid of his son Sivakumar and demanded him to transfer all his belongings in her name but the appellant did not heed to her request explaining that as long as he is alive, he would hold the properties and the question of inheriting the property could be discussed later. Provoked by this, she abused the appellant in public places like temples and relatives' and friends' houses. Many close friends like Kalyani Easwaran and P.N. Kumar would bear testimony to the inhumane and intolerable behaviour of the respondent towards the appellant, his aged mother and his son. c. The appellant is the Managing Director of Reliance Foods Pvt. Limited carrying on business in sports goods and equipments and there were three persons working under him in the showroom. In addition to this, the appellant is also running a consumer products distributing agency in the name of Reliance Agencies in which also, three persons were employed. d. While so, the respondent started a new practice of coming to the business spot and unnecessarily picking up quarrel with the appellant in front of the staff and customers and cause embarrassment to him. She interfered with the working of the staff using foul language against them and also threatened to send them out of employment. The staff members appealed for better behaviour of the respondent but in vain. The appellant tolerated all the humiliations for a period of two years and a stage came for the appellant that it would not be possible for him any more to live with the respondent. The appellant with the knowledge that the respondent was a twice divorced woman, married her with the hope that during his advancing years, she would be a source of comfort andA. Viswanathan vs G. Lakshmi @ Seetha on 20 November, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1341139/ 2relief to him. To his misery, his life became miserable and he lost his peace and happiness completely. He had developed a feeling of insecurity for him, his mother and his son and he was left with no other alternative except to leave the respondent and accordingly, left the matrimonial home. Unable to bear the cruelty inflicted by the respondent on the appellant, his mother and son too left the matrimonial home and started living separately and therefore, the appellant filed a petition seeking a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. 4. In response, the respondent filed her counter and her case, in nutshell, is as follows: a. After the appellant's marriage with the respondent, one lady by name Vasantha, employed under the appellant, used to come frequently to their house when the respondent was away at her office. The appellant and Vasantha used to move intimately. When the respondent came back from her office early, the appellant and the said Vasantha used to ignore the respondent and happily take their food and go away in the car. When questioned, she was beaten up by the appellant. The appellant used to indulge in teasing the respondent always and he used to compare her with their dog. At the early stages, the respondent used to keep quiet. But, eventually, when the visits of Vasantha started to boss over the respondent, she started revolting as a result of which frequent quarrels arose between the appellant and the respondent. b. The appellant always used to find fault with the action of the respondent without any reason. It is only the appellant and his son who would beat her. She is neither hysterical nor would beat and spit on the faces of the appellant, his mother and son. Although the appellant's son is aged 15 to 16 years, he would sleep with the appellant and the respondent and misbehaved with the respondent. Her efforts to correct him failed and the appellant instead of reprimanding his son, would turn to the other side of the bed. The respondent had also informed this to her mother-in-law but she did not believe this. The respondent had no intention of chasing away the appellant's son as falsely alleged and on the other hand, she used to treat him as her own son and advised him properly and tried to change him. c. She was a State Government employee at the time of marriage with the appellant and was earning Rs.4,000/- per month. She used to give her entire salary to the appellant and at the instance of the appellant, she took voluntary retirement from service during February 1995 and she had received the retirement amount of Rs.1,30,000/- which was also given to him. The Provident Fund loan for Rs.20,000/- and Sriram chit amount of Rs.10,000/- were also handed over to the appellant. She was never interested in money or property and all that she needed was a happy married life and therefore, there is no question of the respondent asking the appellant to transfer all his belongings in her name. She never insulted the appellant in public places and it was only the appellant who used to tease the respondent and harass her in places and in the presence of office staff of the respondent and also used to beat her. Due to the appellant's intolerable behaviour, her ears and eyes were damaged and she became alright after medical aid. Whenever the respondent called the appellant over phone, Vasantha used to answer the call and tell her that the appellant had gone out and upon insistence, she would give the line to the appellant. On the allegation that she visited the appellant's shop, it is the respondent's reply that she had to been to the appellant's shop only once on her way back to home and that only at the request of the appellant to check up certain matters inA.

228,"Delhi High Court Ashok Ratti Lal Trivedi vs Anjani Madhusudan Oza on 16 May, 1967 Equivalent citations: 4 (1968) DLT 235 Author: M Ismail Bench: M Ismail JUDGMENT M.M. Ismail, J. (1) This Civil revision petition filed under section 115, Civil Procedure Code, raises an important question regarding the construction of section 25 of the. Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Central Act 25 of 1955). The petitioner married the respondent herein in May, 1864. On a petition filed by the respondent herein in January, 1965, the marriage was annulled uner section 12(1)(a) of the Hindu Marrriaga Act, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the Act by a decree of mullity passed by learned Additional District Judge, Delhi, on 26th April, 1966. On. 9th June, 1966, the respondent herin applied for an order for payment of permanent alimony to her. That application of the respondent wa resisted by the petitioner herein on the ground that the marriage having been declared to be a nullity, the relationship of husband and wife never existed between the parties and hence, in any event, it ceased with the passing of the said decree and in consequence 237. the petition filed by the respondent was nto maintainable. It was contended by the petitioner herein, in the alternative, that the petition filed by the respondent herein for permanent maintenance would nto lie because it was made after the passing of the decree of nullity. This being a question regarding the maintainability of the petition itself, the questions were tried as preliminary issues by the learned Additional District judge, Delhi; they being- 1. Whether the present petition is maintainable in view of the objection raised in paragraph 1 of the written statement? 2. Whether the petition does nto lie because it was filed after the final decree of nullity? (2) Before the learned Additional District Judge the present petitioner herein, in support of his contention as to the petition filed by the respondent for the award of permanent alimony nto being maintainable, relied on a decision of the Gujarat High Court in Guntantrary v. Baim Prabha, and certain observations of the Madres High Court in the decision in Narayanasuami v Padmanabhan. The learned Additional District Judge, after carefully considering the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner herein, by his order dated 22nd February, 1967,overruled the objetions of the petitioner herein and held that the petition was maintainable. It is against this order of the learned Additional District Judge Delhi, that the petitioner herein has filed the present civil revision petition before this Court. (3) Before me the learned counsel repeated the contentions put forward before the Court below and relied upon the same two decisions. The contention of the learned counsel is that sectiont 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, contemplates an application being filed by the husband or the wife, as the case may be, for the grant of maintenance and that necessarily indicates that the person applying for the grant of maintenance must have the status of the husband or the wife. 'In the case of a marriage which has been declared to be a nullity it is as If no marriage has taken place at all and consequently the parties to that marriage could nto have been described as the husband and the wire. In the alternative, he conferded that with reference to an application filed after the passing of the decree of nullity the parties to the marriage, which was the subject-matter of that decree, could nto beAshok Ratti Lal Trivedi vs Anjani Madhusudan Oza on 16 May, 1967 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/354444/ 1described as continuing to be husband and wife and consequently the description of husband or wife will nto be applicable to the man or woman whose marriage has been annulled, subsequent to the decree of nullity and, therefore,an application for the award of maintenance cannto be made by such person after the decree. Belore considering the validity and soundness of these contentions, it is necessary to have regard to the saliant features of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Act to the extent to which it makes provisions for anything overrides all text, rules or interpretation of Hindu law or any law in force immediately prior to the Act. Section 5 enumenates the essential conditions which have to be fulfillled before a marriage cab be solemnized between any two Hindus. Section 9 of the Act provices for passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Section 10 of the Act enumerates the grounds on which a decree for judicial separation can be obtained. Section 11 of the Act stipulates that a marriage solemnized in contravention of certain conditions enumerated in section 5 shall be null and void and be so declared by a decree of nullity on a petition presented by any party to the marriage. section 12 enumerates the grounds on which a marriage is voidable and provides that the marriage can be annulled by a decree of nullity. Section 13 of the Act provides for the grounds on which a marriage can be dissolved by a decree of divorce. After certain provisions regarding procedure and jurisdiction there occur the following two sections, namely, sections 24 and 25, which are as follows - ""24.Maintenance pendents Me and expanses of proceedings: Wherein any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings, and monthly during the proceedings such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it: may seem to the court to be reasonable. 25. Permanent alimony and maintenance.-(1) Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, an application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant fur her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term nto exceeding the life of the applicant, as, having reward to the respondent's own income and toher property if any, the income and toher property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent. (2) If the court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has made an order under sub-section (i) it may, at the instance of either party, vary, modify or resond any such order in such manner as the court may deem just. (3) If the court is satisfied that the party in whose favor an order has been made under this section has re married, or, if such party is the wife, that she has nto remained chaste, or, if such party is the husband, that he has had secual intercourse with any woman outside wedlock, it shall rescind the order."" It is against this background that the scope of section 25 has to be understood and I have referred to section 24 also in this context since buth the sections constitute the provisions, at to different stages, as part of the same scheme. As has been mentioned above, the Act contemplates four types of decreess, namely, a decrcee for restitution of conjugal rights, a decree for judicial separation, a decree of divorce, and a decree of nullity-either on the ground that the marriage is null and void or on the ground that the marriage is voidable. In this context when section 24 speaks of ""where in anyAshok Ratti Lal Trivedi vs Anjani Madhusudan Oza on 16 May, 1967 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/354444/ 2proceeding under this Act"" it certainly contemplates all proceedings, namely, proceedings for obtaining any one of the decrees mentioned above and there can be no doubt whatever that as far as section 24 is concerned, which provides for the award of maintenance pendents lites and for the expenses of proceedings, it covers every proceeding under the Act. Then the question arises whether the next section, namely, section 25, providing for the payment of permanet alimony and maintenance, is in any way narrower or is whittled down in scope than section 24. Section 25(1) opens with the expressions ""any court exercising Jurisdiction under this Act"" and this expression, though refers to the Court exercising jurisdication, covers from the very width of the expression all proceedings under the Act. The section also uses the expression ""at the time of passing any decree"" and this again clerarly emphasises that the power of the Court under this section is applicable to all kinds of proceedings covered by the Act, namely, proceedings for obtaining any of the four decrees already referred to. With reference to the scope of this section an argument had been advanced at the bar in the past that ntowithstanding the apparent width of this jurisdiction still the expression ""any decree"" occurring in the section must be confined only to decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity and nto to toher to two decrees. This argument was sought to be supported from the use of the expression occuning in the section, namely, ""while the applicant remains unmarried"". The argument was that the question of the applicant remaining unmarried can arise subsequent to the decree only in two cases, namely, the decree of divorce and the decree of nullity, and it cannto occur in the case of the toher two decrees, namely, the decree for restitution of conjugal rights and the decree for judicial separation. However this argument has nto been countenanced by the Courts. In a decision in Harilal v. Litavah, the learned Judges K. T. Desai, C. J. and V. B Raju, J after referring to section 24, 25 and 26 of the Act and the principles of interpretation contained in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes in this behalf obser ved as follows:- ""THECourts have always been extremely reluctant to substitute words in a statute or add words to it. A court would do so where there is a repugnancy to good sense The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, cannto be regarded as a work of art. It is nto ntoed for good draf. ting. It contains several provisions which present difficulties while interpretting the same. The words used in some sections are far from happy and difficulties are experienced in gathering the true meaning of the legislature. There is however one thing clear that the main- object and intention of the enactment was to amend the modify the law relating to marriage among Hindus. The intention was nto to restrict the powers of the Court in granting permanent alimony and maintenance to extremely limited class of cases, namely where the Court had passed a decree for divorce or of nullity of marriage. The words used in section are 'at the time of passing any decree'. The words any decree' would nto have been used if it was the intention of the legislature to restrict the operation of the section only to cases where a decree for divorce or of nullity of marriage was passed. The power was ""intented to be exercised at the time of the passing of any of the decrees referred to in the earlier provisions of the Act or at any time subsequent thereto, The legislature however has in serted the words 'while the applicant remains unmarried'. The legislature could only have intended to make those words applicable in those cases where a party was in a position to contract a marriage. Those words could nto, with any properiety, be used in respect of these cases where the marriage bond remains unserved. The legislature, in enacting section 25, has even sought to go beyond the ordinaiy provions of law relating to alimony and maintenance as applicable to toher communities. It has sought to provide permanent alimony and maintenance even for a husband. when the legislature was seeking to extend the provisions relating to permanent alimony and maintenance so as even to make a husband eligible for receiving permantAshok Ratti Lal Trivedi vs Anjani Madhusudan Oza on 16 May, 1967 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/354444/ 3","['10', '13', '5', '9', '11', '25']"

The facts of this case once again proves that time is a great leveller. A member of the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family, the head of which, the Maharaja of Cochin, once ruled part of the present Kerala State, has come down to the earth and is fighting for rights in family property just like lesser mortals. Stage by stage, the members of the royal family lost their pre-eminent position in the society and have now become very ordinary citizens, which is exemplified by this case. 2. With the advent of democracy, the Monarch lost his Kingdom and throne. Still, the family was not subject to all the personal laws of the land. By virtue of Sub-section (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Succession Act, which applied to all the other Hindus in the country, properties of the Cochin Royal Family, which is known as Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and the Palace Fund were exempted from the purview of the said Act, although the members of the family were Hindus. By virtue of Proclamation IX of 1124 dated 29th June, 1949, the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and the Palace Fund which were the Joint Hindu Family properties of the Cochin Royal Family were impartiable and were administered by the Palace Administration Board created by the said proclamation promulgated by the Maharaja of Cochin. Later on, by the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and Palace Fund (Partition) Act, 1961, (for short 'the Partition Act') Clause (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which exempted the said estate and palace fund from the purview of the Hindu Succession Act, was omitted with effect from the date of execution of the partition deed in respect of the family properties under Section 6 of the above said Partition Act. Later on, after the enactment of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975, the Partition Act was again amended amending certain provisions of the Act so as to make it in consonance with the change of law on account of the enactment of Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1976. However, the members of the Royal Family did not have the right available to ordinary citizens in so far as by virtue of Section 7 of the Partition Act, they had no right to institute a suit for partition of the estate and the palace fund. It is in view of the embargo contained in that section, this Original Petition has come up before this Court, which essentially is in the nature of a suit for partition. 3. The facts of this case makes interesting reading. The 1st petitioner in this Original Petition, namely, Smt. Krishnakumari Thampuran is a member of the Cochin Royal Family. She originally married a Namboodiri and begot a male child in that wedlock. Later on, while the said husband was still alive, without obtaining divorce, the 1st petitioner married a Muslim and begot two children in that marriage, who are petitioners 2 and 3 in this Original Petition. Essentially, this Original Petition relates to the claim of petitioners 2 and 3, the children of the 1st petitioner, in her illegitimate marriage, for share in the family properties, namely, the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and the Palace Fund in accordance with the Partition Act. While the Palace Administration Board denies the right of petitioners 2 and 3 as members of the Cochin Royal Family, the petitioners claimKrishnakumari Thampuran vs Palace Administration Board on 8 August, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1161613/ 1that they are members of the Thavazhi of their mother and as such are entitled to equal shares in the family properties just like any other member of the family. 4. Before going into the legal issues raised, let us recapitulate the provisions of law applicable on the subject. By virtue of the proclamation of the Maharaja of Cochin promulgated on 29th June, 1949, the administration of the estate and the palace fund treated as per the proclamation vested with the Palace Administration Board the 1st respondent herein. As I have already mentioned earlier, originally, by virtue of Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Succession Act, the provisions of the said Act were not applicable to the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and the Palace Fund administered by the Palace Administration Board and the family properties were not partible also. In 1961, the Kerala Legislature enacted the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and Palace Fund (Partition) Act, 1961, to make provision for the partition of the Valiamma Thampuran Kovilagam Estate and Palace Fund belonging to the family of the Maharaja of Cochin. The provisions relating to such partition in the said Act, relevant for our purpose were originally contained in Sections 3 to 7 of the said Act which read as follows: 3. Maharaja of Cochin to order partition:Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 22 of the Proclamation, if arequest in writing is made by the majority of the major members and the Maharaja of Cochin is satisfied that in the interests of the family it would be desirable to partition the Estate and the Palace Fund, among all the members, he may declare his decision to effect a partition under his supervision and control, and direct the Board to proceed with the partition. (2) The decision of the Maharaja of Cochin under Sub-section (1) shall be published by the Board in the Gazette in English and Malayalam. and a copy of the notification shall be affixed in a conspicuous place at the office of the Board. 4. Share of members: (1) Each member shall be entitled to an equal share of the Estate and the Palace Fund. (2) The share obtained by a member on partition shall be the separate property of the member. (3) A child who is in the womb on the date of the publication of the decision under Section 3 and who is subsequently born alive shall have the same right for a share in the Estate and the Palace Fund as any other member as if he or she had been born on or before the date of such publication. 5. Power to exclude properties from partition: (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3, the Maharaja of Cochin may, if he is satisfied that any specified property or properties of the Estate and the Palace Fund shall not be partitioned, but shall remain as common property for the benefit of the family, exclude such property or properties from being partitioned.Krishnakumari Thampuran vs Palace Administration Board on 8 August, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1161613/ 2(2) Any property excluded under Sub-section (1) shall be subject to the management of the Board and the provisions of the Proclamation shall apply to such property. 6. Execution and registration of partition deed: The deed of partition shall be executed on behalf of all the members by the Maharaja of Cochin and the members of the Board and shall be binding on all the members of the family and shall be registered under the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (Central Act 16 of 1908). 7. Suit for partition barred: Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer on any member the right to institute a suit for partition of the Estate and the Palace fund. 5. Later on, by Amendment Act 15 of 1978, the said Act was amended. Sections 4 and 5 were deleted and Section 3 was amended as follows: 3. Partition of the Estate and the Palace Fund: (1) The seniormost male member of the family shall, within sixty days from the date of commencement of the Valiamma Thampuram Kovilakam Estate and the Palace Fund (Partition) and the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Amendment Ordinance, 1978, direct the Board to effect partition of the Estate and the Palace Fund among all the members entitled to a share of the Estate and the Palace Fund under Section 4 of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975 (30 of 1976), and such a direction shall be published by the Board in the Gazette: (2) If the seniormost male member fails to direct the Board as required by Sub-section (1) the Board shall, on the expiry of the period specified in that sub-section proceed to effect the partition of the Estate and the Palace Fund among the members referred to in Sub-section (1), and the partition so effected shall be valid notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4 of the Proclamation. The other provisions essentially remain the same. Apparently, this amendment was necessitated because of the enactment of Sections 3 and 4 of the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975, which read as follows: 3. Birth in family not to give rise to rights in property: On and afterthe commencement of this Act, no right to claim any interest in any property of an ancestor during his or her lifetime which is founded on the mere fact that the claimant was born in the family of the ancestor shall be recognised in any court, 4. Joint tenancy to be replaced by tenancy in common: (1) All members of an undivided Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law holding any coparcenary property on the day this Act comes into force shall, with effect from that day, be deemed to hold it as tenants-in-common as if a partition had taken place among all the members of that undivided Hindu family as respects such property and as if each one of them is holding his or her share separately as full owner thereof:Krishnakumari Thampuran vs Palace Administration Board on 8 August, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1161613/ 3","['6', '4', '3', '22', '5', '7']"

Radhakrishnan, J. 1. Defendants 1 to 4 in a suit for partition are the appellants in this second appeal challenging the preliminary decree passed by the trial court, confirmed in first appeal. The first appellant having died during the pendency of the second appeal, appellants 2 to 4 were recorded as her legal representatives. 2. Sri. Ramunni, a Hindu, died intestate on 25-2-1974. His estate is sought to be partitioned. The late first defendant was his widow. Defendants 2 to 4 are their children. Plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8 are, admittedly, the children of Ramunni through Kallyani, who is not a party to the suit, but examined as P.W.2. 3. Defendants 1 to 4, the appellants herein, contended that there was no valid marriage between Ramunni and Kallyani and accordingly, the plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8 were the illegitimate children of Ramunni and hence not entitled to succeed to his estate. 4. On the basis of the evidence on record, the trial court found that Ramunni and P.W.2 had undergone the ceremonies of a marriage in 1957. However, it held that the same was void by reason of Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'), being one in contravention of Section 5(i) of that Act, in as much as Ramunni had a spouse living at that time. But, the trial court held that the plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8, the illegitimate children of Ramunni were also entitled to be treated as legitimate and hence entitled to share, in view of Section 16 of the Act. 5. During the course of the suit, the plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8 conceded one share to the mother of Ramunni on the ground that he had predeceased her. She had released her such share to defendants 1 to 4. 6. Accordingly, the trial court passed a preliminary decree directing that the suit properties be divided into 10 shares and, leaving out 1 share that was conceded to Ramunni's mother's estate, the plaintiff and defendants, 8 in number, were to take a share each. The lower appellate court has confirmed it. Hence this second appeal under Section 100 C.P.C. by defendants 1 to 4. 7. I have heard Adv. Sri. V.V. Asokan on behalf of the appellants and Adv. Sri. T.A. Ramadasan, on behalf of the respondents. 8. The learned Counsel for the appellants argued that the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 68/1976), hereinafter referred to as 'the Amending Act', came into operation, having received the assent of the President and published in Gazette of India only on 27-5-1976 and that therefore, the provisions contained in Section 16 of the Act, as substituted by the Amending Act, could notNarayani vs Aravindakshan on 7 July, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077946/ 1apply to confer legitimacy on plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8 to succeed to the estate of Ramunni, who died intestate on 25-2-1974, i.e. before the Amending Act came into operation. It is contended that they are illegitimate children who obtained the status of legitimacy only in 1976, by the effect of the Amending Act, long after succession had opened as regards the estate of Ramunni, upon his death. It is urged that, as far as the estate of Ramunni is concerned, succession opened out upon his death on 25-2-1974 and that it cannot be postponed. In support of this argument, reliance is placed on the decision of the Apex Court in Daya Singh 's case, . Relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Eapen Chacko's case, 1977 KLT 1, it is urged that while interpreting a statute, rights which are already vested in the parties should be respected. Referring to R. Muthammal's case and Deo Kishen's case, ([1983] ILR 5 All. 509) referred to, in R. Muthammal's case, it is pointed out that in similar situations, where disabilities were removed, provisions were held not to affect situations before the coming into force of the statute. It is further urged that the amendment of 1976, to Section 16, is not a declaratory legislation and there is no indication in the Amending Act that the Parliament intended to give retrospective operation to the said provision. 9. This Court had, in the decisions relied on by the courts below, Janu's case (1989 (1) KLT 392) and Karthi Pankajakshy's case (1990 (1) KLT 248), dealt with the applicability of Section 16 of the Act as amended. The learned Counsel for the appellants has attempted to distinguish the said precedents by contending that the question of law specifically raised in this second appeal was not raised and considered in the said decisions, though the judgment in Janu's case would show that Gopalan, whose estate was being considered in that case died before the Amending Act was notified in 1976. 10. Per contra, the learned Counsel appearing for the contesting respondents (plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8) contended that in Parayankandiyal Eravath Kanapravan Kalliani Amma's case wherein the judgment of this Court in A.S.68 of 1980 and connected cases was set aside, the Apex Court had, after considering the effect of the amendment, granted relief to the appellants therein by relying on Section 16 of the Act as amended, though Sri. Raman Nair whose estate was the subject matter of those appeals died on 9-1-1975, i.e. before the Amending Act obtained the assent of the President and was published. He also pointed out two subsequent decisions of the Apex Court - Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi and 11. Though Rameshwari Devi's case (supra) was decided relying on Section 16 of the Act as amended, the date of death of Narain Lal, whose estate was sought to be partitioned, is noticed to be in 1987, i.e. after the amending Act was published. Jinia Keotin's case (supra) related to the question as to whether the provisions of Section 16 enable an otherwise illegitimate child to claim the inheritance in ancestral coparcenary property. The decisions in Rameshwari Devi and Jinia Keotin do not, therefore, throw any light on the controversy at hand. 12. In PEK Kalliani Amma (supra), a judgment having far reaching effects and implications, Section 16 of the Act as amended was examined and interpreted by the Apex Court. Analysing the provision, it was held that by virtue of the words 'notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11', the section stands independent of Section 11. It was held that the amended provision which intended the conferment of legitimacy on children born of a void marriage would operate despite the provisions contained in Section 11 which had the effect of nullifying only those marriagesNarayani vs Aravindakshan on 7 July, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077946/ 2held after the Act came into force and which were performed in contravention of Section 5. The significance of this interpretation is that by virtue of the legal fiction in Section 16, children born of a void marriage would have to be treated as legitimate for all purposes including succession to the property of their parents. The net effect of this interpretation is that the benefit of legitimacy is conferred upon any child born either before or after the date of the amendment. This would mean that even if a marriage had been contracted at the time when there was a legislative bar to such a marriage, the offspring of such a marriage would be treated as legitimate. Such a child would, by virtue of this interpretation, be entitled to succeed to the property of his or her parents. 13. Having regard to the questions advanced, the issue that arises for decision is the one formulated as the substantial question of law arising for decision in this second appeal, on which notice was issued on 23-11-1993. The said substantial question, so formulated, is as follows:  (i)    Has Section 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 as amended by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 1976 (Central Act 68 of 1976) got such a retrospective effect as to enable the plaintiff and defendants 5 to 8 to divest defendants 1 to 4 of the estate of Ramunni that had already vested in them in 1974 prior to the commencement of Act 68 of 1976? 14. Section 16 of the Act, as it originally stood, is as follows: ""16. Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.--Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of any marriage under Section 11 or Section 12; any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if it had been dissolved instead of having been declared null and void or annulled by a decree of nullity shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of nullity: Provided that nothing contained in this Section shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is declared null and void or annulled by a decree of nullity any rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents in any case where but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents."" 15. Section 11 of the Amending Act provided as follows: ""11. Substitution of new section for Section 16:~ For Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act the following section shall be substituted, namely:- ""16. Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages: (1) Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act.Narayani vs Aravindakshan on 7 July, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077946/ 3","['10', '16', '12', '5', '11']"

V. Dabholkar, J. 1. While considering Family Court Appeal No. 12/2003, Bhausaheb v. Leelabai, a Division Bench of this High Court (Coram : B. H. Marlapalle and V. G. Munshi, JJ), felt satisfied that issue raised by the appellant - husband requires consideration by a larger bench of this Court. Hence, after passing an elaborate order on 17-2-2003, the Division Bench directed the Additional Registrar (Judicial) to place the matter before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders, under Rule 7 of Chapter I of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules, 1960, for a reference to a larger bench. The Hon'ble the Chief Justice, on the matter being placed before his Lordship, was pleased to constitute a full bench and that is how the present reference was heard and is being disposed of by this full bench. 2. Brief factual matrix of the litigation should be stated herein so as to appreciate how the point of controversy under reference arose and was referred. Petition No. C-39/2001 was filed by Leelabai against appellant Bhausaheb for maintenance under section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Hereinafter referred as HM Act for the sake of brevity). The same was decided on 30-11-2002 by Principal Judge, Family Court, Aurangabad, who was pleased to allow the petition and award maintenance @ Rs. 1,000/- p.m. in favour of Leelabai from the date of petition. Appellant - Bhausaheb has taken a stand before Family Court of total denial of solemnization of marriage on 16-12-1997 and in the alternative, he also claimed that he was already having a spouse living on 16-12-1997 and therefore, alleged marriage with Leelabai on that day, cannot be said to be a valid marriage. Thus, contending that marriage, if any, between him and Leelabai, was void marriage in the light of section 5(i) read with section 11 of HM Act and therefore, she was not entitled for maintenance under section 25 of the said Act. 3. Eventually, this was not the first round of litigation of the parties. Earlier, Leelabai had approached Family Court by filing Petition No. A-165/1996 against one Narayan Ahire for dissolution of marriage and obtained an ex-parte decree on 6-1-1997. The marriage between Leelabai and Narayan Ahire (presumably, her first husband) stood dissolved by the said decision. Leelabai married appellant Bhausaheb thereafter on 16-12-1997. After some days since this marriage, she had filed prosecution against Bhausaheb under sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 of IP Code. Simultaneously, she had filed an application under section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 before the Family Court, registered as Petition No. E-331/1999 for maintenance. The said petition was dismissed on 25-3-2000 by the Family Court observing that she was not legally wedded wife of Bhausaheb. In the meanwhile, Leelabai had also filed Petition No. B-7/2000 before the Family Court, seeking a declaration that marriage between herself and Bhausaheb is valid marriage and Madhuri is theirBhausaheb @ Sandu S/O Raghuji ... vs Leelabai W/O Bhausaheb Magar on 7 July, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/445646/ 1legitimate daughter. Along with that petition, she had filed Petition No. E-525/2000, seeking maintenance for daughter. These two petitions were decided on 29-11-2001. Petition, seeking declaration regarding validity of the marriage, was dismissed, again by observing that Leelabai was not a legally wedded wife of Bhausaheb. The child, Madhuri. however, was granted maintenance @Rs. 500/- p.m. On the backdrop of the above legal battles, Leelabai filed Petition No. C-39/2001 under section 25 of HM Act for permanent alimony which is allowed by the Family Court, as narrated hereinabove and hence, the First Appeal by Bhausaheb. 4. The Division Bench of this Court, while considering the Family Court Appeal for admission, has taken a note that learned Judge of the Family Court has placed reliance upon decisions of this High Court in the matters of Shantaram Patil v. Dagubai (DB), 1987 Mh.L.J. 179 and Krishnakant Vyas v. Reena (SJ) , and the argument of learned counsel for Bhausaheb based upon a decision of full bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the matter of Abbayolla M. Subba Reddy v. Padmamma AIR 1999 AP 19, was rejected by the trial Court. Although reliance was also placed on the decision of Chand Dhavan v. Jawaharlal, , the Division Bench was of the view that decision of the Apex Court in this matter has not specifically dealt with abovesaid issue i.e. conflict of views taken by Bombay High Court in the judgments relied upon by Family Court while awarding maintenance in favour of Leelabai and the view taken by full bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court that section 25 should not be construed in such a manner as to hold that notwithstanding the nullity of the marriage, wife retains her status for the purpose of applying for alimony or maintenance. Naturally, by virtue of reference, we are required to resolve the controversy and record a finding as to which, out of two view points, is the correct legal position. 5. Heard Advocate Shri R. K. Barlota representing the appellant -Bhausaheb and Advocate Shri S. L. Jondhale, representing respondent in Family Court Appeal No. 12/2003. 6. In fact, view taken by Bombay High Court, in the recent judgment of Krishnakant v. Reena (supra) and prior to that in the matter of Shantaram v. Dagubai (supra), which was relied upon by the learned Judge of the Family Court, was not the view recorded for the first time. It appears that Bombay High Court has been consistently taking such a view right from the matter of Govindrao v. Anandibai, 1997 Mh.LJ. 144, which was a decision in Appeal No. 93/1976, decided on 24-3-1976. In that matter, Anandibai had married Govindrao on 24-5-1959 when respondent No. 2 (first wife of Govindrao) was still alive and marriage between Govindrao and respondent No. 2 was still subsisting. It was claimed that in March, 1963, appellant and respondent No. 2 drove away Anandibai. On 11-12-1972, Anandibai filed a petition in the Court of CJSD, Kolhapur for a declaration that marriage between herself and Govindrao was null and void and also praying for maintenance @ Rs. 150/- p.m. The learned Civil Judge held marriage to be null and void as contravening the provision of section 5(i) of HM Act and while granting a decree for declaration of nullity of the marriage, allowed permanent alimony @ Rs. 125/- in favour of Anandibai. The Appeal before the District Court, by Govindrao was also dismissed and therefore, Govindrao had approached this Court.Bhausaheb @ Sandu S/O Raghuji ... vs Leelabai W/O Bhausaheb Magar on 7 July, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/445646/ 2It was contended on behalf of appellant that the words ""wife"" and ""husband"", used in Sub-section (1) of section 25 of HM Act, must be construed in their strict dictionary sense and so construed would mean only a legally wedded Hindu wife and legally wedded Hindu husband. It was, thus, submitted that ceremony of marriage gone through between appellant and respondent No. 1 was null and void ab initio, which never created relationship of 'husband' and 'wife' in the legal sense and therefore, provision of section 25 cannot be invoked. While rejecting the arguments, it was observed by the Court (Coram : M. H. Kania, J., as His Lordship then was):-- ""At the first blush, this submission, undoubtedly, appears little attractive. But a closer analysis of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 25 shows the fallacy thereof. In the first place, the opening part of this subsection shows that the discretion given to the Court of awarding maintenance at the time of passing any decree and one of the decrees which the Court can pass under the said Act is a decree of nullity under section 11 thereof. Hence, if the strict interpretation propounded by Mr. Pendse were to be given to the words ""Wife"" and ""Husband"", the scope of the expression on ""any decree"" used in this sub-section would have to be artificially cut down so as to exclude from its scope a decree for nullity passed under section 11 of the Act."" It was further observed :-- ""Secondly, it must be remembered that Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is a piece of social welfare legislation. One of the admitted aims of this legislation was to better the lot of women in Hindu society, which it was felt by legislature needed amelioration. It was with this end in view that certain rights were conferred on Hindu Women by the Hindu Marriage Act as well as certain other measures, like the Act of 1956."" Hence, it was expressed that while construing such a piece of legislation, it would not be right to adopt a narrow approach, but a liberal and progressive approach, keeping in mind that it was the liberal and progressive approach of the legislature which lead to the enactment being passed. It was further observed that it could not have been the intention of the legislature that even in a case where a Hindu woman has been duped into contracting a bigamous marriage with a Hindu male without knowing that there was already a subsisting marriage to which he was a party, even then, she should be deprived of her right to claim maintenance on obtaining decree for nullity. In the light, of these observations, Anandibai, who had cohabited with Govindrao along with his first wife for a period of six years until she was driven out, was held not disentitled for permanent alimony. 7. In case of Rajeshbai v. Shantabai, , Shantabai had filed a suit seeking relief of injunction against defendants (brothers of Sadashiv) restraining them from disturbing her possession and enjoyment of the properties and alternatively also seeking possession of the properties which would be found to be not in her possession. The reliefs were so claimed on the basis that plaintiff Shantabai was the lawfully married wife of deceased Sadashiv and upon his death was entitled to inherit all his properties.

This is a petition filed by the husband who is an Indian Christian under the Indian Divorce Act and under Clause 35 of the Letters Patent for obtaining a decree that his marriage with the respondent be declared null and void. The original petition has been amended pursuant to the order dated April 3, 1974 on April 17, 1974, making allegation that the respondent committed frequent acts of adultery with the co-respondent since December 6, 1970. An additional prayer has been made that in the alternative to the prayer of declaring the marriage null and void, the Court may pass a decree of divorce in favour of the petitioner. Though this was an ex parte matter, after recording the evidence of certain witnesses, my brother Kania J. felt that the petition raises some important questions of law and the Court would require assistance of some advocate and made an order requesting Mrs. Manohar to appear as amicus curiae to assist the Court. After this order, the petitioner has amended the petition and has also prayed for a decree for divorce as mentioned above. It is the case of the petitioner that in April 1968, one V.R. Lond he and one L.W. Bansode of Poona met petitioner's maternal uncle Rev. N.R. Pandit and made representations that respondent was a virgin; that she has passed S.S.C, examination and that she was working as a steno-typist in an office at Bombay. These representations were made to Pandit with a view to suggest that the respondent would be an admirably suitable person as wife for the petitioner. 2. As suggested by the parties, a meeting was arranged on April 28, 1968 in Bombay at the residence of the respondent at Goregaon. It is the petitioner's case that the petitioner was introduced to the respondent and her parents there. The petitioner was accompanied by Pandit and at that meeting, respondent's parents represented to the petitioner that the respondent was a girl of good moral character and a virgin; that she had passed S.S.C. examination and had completed a, Telephone Operator's course and a course in Stenography and that she was employed as a steno-typist with Messrs. Comteck Laboratories, Mahim, Bombay. According to the petitioner, there was a further meeting which took place at Poona at the house of Bansode. At that meeting, the petitioner's mother and Pandit were present and respondent and her parents, Bansode and one Patole were also present. Again the same representations were repeated to Pandit by the respondent and her parents. According to the petitioner, these representations regarding the character and qualifications and respondent's service were all false. According to him, they were fraudulently made, dishonestly concealing- the true facts with a view to deceive the petitioner and to induce the petitioner to marry the respondent. Relying on the said representations and believing them to be true, the petitioner agreed to marry the respondent. After this, the petitioner and the respondent signed the marriage notice form, wherein the petitioner stated that he was a bachelor and the respondent stated that she was a Kumari. The respondent stated in the form that her date of birth was September 4, 1949, which according to the subsequent information received by the petitioner was also a false birth date. The petitioner in the petition has also alleged that the respondent deliberately and fraudulently and with a view to concealing her character which was notorious, avoided publication of her banns inDavid Alias Balasaheb Sunderrao ... vs Kalpana Alias Mai Alias ... on 12 December, 1974 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1617543/ 1Bombay so that the people of her parish in Bombay may not know that she was getting married and may not raise a lawful impediment to her marriage. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondent instead of mentioning her real name viz. Vijayamala by which she was called from birth and continued to be called, falsely stated her name as Kalpana in the notice of marriage. It is also the case of the petitioner that instead of publishing the banns in the Bombay Church to which the respondent's parents belonged, the banns were published in the Brother Deshpande Memorial Church, Poona, with a view that the respondent's antecedence could not be known. On May 27, 1968, the petitioner and the respondent went through a marriage in the Hume Memorial Church, Ahmednagar. According to the petitioner, this was a pretended marriage. As the marriage was held at Ahmednagar, the petitioner and the respondent spent the wedding night at the residence of the petitioner's maternal uncle, the said Pandit at Ahmednagar. It is the ease of the petitioner that on the same night i.e. the first night of the wedding, when the petitioner and the respondent were alone together, petitioner was surprised to find that the respondent was behaving in a manner of a girl who was well experienced in sexual intercourse. The petitioner found that the respondent was not a virgin. When the petitioner protested, the respondent confessed that she was experienced in sex and she was not in fact a virgin. She also admitted that she had been carrying on with a married man with whom even at that time she was in love. It is the petitioner's allegation that the respondent told him that she never loved the petitioner. But she and her parents deliberately made the efforts of false representations to the petitioner to conceal her past and to induce the petitioner to j her. The petitioner reacted and told the respondent that fraud had been practised upon him and under the circumstances the petitioner would not consider her as his wife and would not have any relations with her. The petitioner told the respondent on that very night that she was free to go wherever she liked or wanted, as the petitioner was not prepared to take her to Pimpri as his wife. 3. The petitioner further states in the petition that the respondent begged of the petitioner not to disgrace her publicly and requested the petitioner to take her to Pimpri for a short time and thereafter to take her back to her parents. The petitioner to keep up the appearance, took the respondent to his quarters at Pimpri for two days, but had no sexual connection with her whatsoever. The petitioner thereafter took the respondent from Pimpri to respondent's parents at Goregaon, Bombay, where after staying the night at Goregaon, the petitioner and the respondent stayed for about six days at the residence of the petitioner's maternal uncle Pandit at Abbott House, Sophia Zuber Road, Byculla, Bombay. But it is the case of the petitioner that he had no sexual intercourse with the respondent during this period. It is further stated in the petition that thereafter from June 1968 to January 25, 1969 the petitioner and the respondent resided together at the petitioner's quarters at Pimpri viz. room No, 8 in quarter No. HB/17, Sindhi Camp, Pimpri, but the petitioner had no sexual relations with the respondent at all. It is further stated in the petition that quarrels broke out between the petitioner and the respondent and ultimately the respondent left the petitioner on or about January 25, 1969 with ""the intention of breaking up the pretended marriage and went to the residence of her brother-in-law, Bansode, at Nana Peth, Poona. There are allegations in the petition that when she went away, she took away some ornaments, but they are not relevant for the determination of this petition and I need not go into the details about those allegations. On these allegations, the petitioner wanted this Court to declare that the said marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was null and void. There was correspondence between the legal advisors of the petitioner and the respondent, wherein the petitioner had pointed out allDavid Alias Balasaheb Sunderrao ... vs Kalpana Alias Mai Alias ... on 12 December, 1974 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1617543/ 2that has been stated above. Besides that, petitioner had filed a criminal complaint under Section 417 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code against the respondent and some of her relations, bearing case No. 324/S of 1971 in the Court of the Presidency Magistrate, Borivli. When the petition was filed, the said criminal complaint was pending, but I am now told that in view of this petition, the criminal complaint has been withdrawn. By amendment, the petitioner has alleged that after he filed this petition for a decree for nullity, in or about the end of October 1973, from one Sudhakar Yadavrao Prabhune, the petitioner came to know that the respondent committed frequent acts of adultery with the co-respondent since December 6, 1970, and as a matter of fact, on December 10, 1970, in the early morning, respondent and the correspondent in the co-respondent's bed room at Madina Manzil were seen together when the wife of the co-respondent was not at home; that the respondent and the co-respondent were also seen together again on December 30, 1970 at Sea View Hotel, Juhu, and the petitioner believed that the respondent had committed adultery and frequent acts of adultery with the co-respondent and has prayed that he is entitled to have his marriage with the respondent dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground of adultery also. When the petition came up for hearing before Kania J on December 6, 1972, the petitioner examined himself as a witness in support of his petition. He also examined one Nilkanth Rangnath Makasare, a Parish Priest of the Emmanuel Church at Proctor Road. He also examined John Yadav Shirshat, a Pastor of the First Church at Ahmednagar known as the Hume Memorial Church and examined N.R. Pandit. The petitioner also examined one Waman Keshav Wad, Principal of the People's Education Society's Maharashtra High School at Lower Parel, to prove that the date of birth was registered as June 3, 1945 and that the respondent was sent up for S.S.C. examination in March 1963, but she did not get through. The petitioner also examined one Abaji Mahadeo Kale, a store-keeper from Comteck Laboratory to show that the respondent was Miss V.P. Londhe; that her first name was Vijayamala; that there is no entry in the register showing the name as Kalpana as an employee and according to Kale, the respondent was working as a packer in the firm. On December 7, 1972, at the request of the petitioner's counsel, the matter was adjourned to December 20, 1972. Thereafter as mentioned above, the petitioner amended the petition on April 17, 1974 pursuant to the order obtained on April 3, 1974 and by amendment, the petitioner has added Kesharikumar Kashinath Shinde as a co-respondent and has also prayed for a decree for divorce on the ground of adultery. When the matter reached before me on December 6, 1974, Mr. Sethna, counsel for the petitioner applied for permission to lead further evidence as the petition was amended and in order to substantiate the allegations of adultery against the respondent and the co-respondent. The permission having been granted, the petitioner has examined one more witness viz. Sudhakar Yadav Prabhune to substantiate his allegations of adultery against the respondent. 4. It is mainly the case of the petitioner that the petition is under Section 18 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 for marriage being declared null and void and it is urged that Section 19 provides the grounds on which a decree for nullity can be obtained from the Court. Section 19 mentions four specific grounds and in the last paragraph, it states: Nothing in this section shall affect the jurisdiction of the High Court to make decrees of nullity of marriage on the ground that the consent of either party was obtained by force or fraud.David Alias Balasaheb Sunderrao ... vs Kalpana Alias Mai Alias ... on 12 December, 1974 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1617543/ 3","['19','18']"
233,"Allahabad High Court Smt. Garima Singh vs Sri Sanjai Singh And Ors. on 27 May, 1996 Equivalent citations: II (1996) DMC 422 Author: S Dikshit Bench: S Dikshit JUDGMENT Shobha Dikshit, J. 1. Petitioner has invoked the revisional/supervisory jurisdiction of this Court praying for quashing of Order dated 19.2.1996 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Divisional), Sitapur, in Misc. Case No. 23 of 1996 by which an application moved by her under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte decree of divorce dated 27.3.1995 allegedly obtained by the respondent/husband, a sitting Rajya Sabha Member, by means of a fraud upon the Court has been rejected as not maintainable. Petitioner's grievance is that her sacrosanct marriage with the respondent performed in the year 1973 as per Hindu customary rites and ceremonies at Allahabad has been dissolved by the impugned decree behind her back, thereby not only stripping her of her marital status but also the dignity and honour of a married Hindu wife. Petitioner alleges that a collusive suit for decree of divorce under Hindu Marriage Act was got filed by the respondent through an imposter impersonating the petitioner Smt. Garima Singh and thus fraudulently obtained the impugned decree of divorce dated 27.3.95. 2. Since fraud on the Court and serious irregularities in the conduct of the case have been alleged, therefore, it is necessary to narrate the facts as averred by the petitioner in the application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure in detail, the same are as follows: 3. Suit No. 78 of 1995 was instituted on 25.2.1995 by one Smt. Garima Singh, claiming to be the wife of Sri Sanjai Singh, the respondent herein, in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sitapur, under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying that by means of a decree of divorce, her marriage with Sri Sanjai Singh, respondent, resident of Lucknow be dissolved. It was averred in the suit that the petitioner was married to the respondent on 14.12.1973 as per Hindu rites and ceremonies at Allahabad and the parties last resided together till 2.4.1992 at Sitapur. Out of the said wedlock three children, now aged between 18 years to 12 years, were born. The sole ground on which the dissolution of marriage was sought was stated in para 4 of the said petition, ""that with the passage of time, disputes due to difference of opinion even in petty matters arose between the parties to this petition and it has become quite impossible for them to live together."" Complete desertion was stated to be with effect from 2.4.1992, i.e., the date since when the respondent/husband is residing at Lucknow. It was specifically averred in para 8 of this petition that there was no collusion between the parties The cause of action was said to have accrued on 2.4.1992 when husband and wife finally parted company at Sitapur to live separately. The territorial jurisdiction, therefore, was also claimed at Sitapur. The suit was valued for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction at Rs. 50,000/-.However, a fixed Court-fee of Rs. 37.50was affixed on the petition for divorce. Interestingly a photograph of young Smt. Garima Singh was affixed on the first page of the petition.Smt. Garima Singh vs Sri Sanjai Singh And Ors. on 27 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498780/ 14. Suit was presented on 25.2.1995 through Counsel and summons were issued on the same day and 15.3.1995 was fixed for filing of written statement and 22.3.1995 for framing of issues. On 15.3.1995 written statement was not filed and neither party appeared before the Court as per proceedings recorded in the suit. On 22.3.1995 the suit was directed to proceed ex-parte in the absence of the respondent and decree of divorce was granted on 27.3.1995. Petitioner states that she never appeared before the Court as is also clear from the proceedings. 5. A written statement was filed in the said suit by the respondent re-iterating the ground of divorce taken in the petition, i.e., ""with the passage of time, difference of opinion in petty matters has been arisen between the parties"", collusion was denied and respondent also prayed for grant of decree of divorce. In other words, there was no opposition to the prayer of the petitioner to grant the decree of divorce. 6. Thereafter it is stated that a news item was published in the daily newspaper The Pioneer' on 23.4.1995 viz. ""Sanjai Singh marries Amita."" Reading the said news, the petitioner was shocked. She immediately contacted the respondent on telephone who accepted that a decree of divorce has been passed by a competent Court of Law. The respondent however did not disclose to the petitioner that the decree was passed by the Civil Judge at Sitapur. It is only on 25.7.1995 that the respondent while he was at Lucknow, on persistent queries being made by the petitioner and her father, disclosed that the decree for divorce was granted by the Court of Civil Judge at Sitapur and he married Amita Modi on 21.4.1995. It is only thereafter that the petitioner immediately rushed to Sitapur and engaged an Advocate who inspected the record which revealed that the aforesaid civil suit for divorce under Hindu Marriage Act was instituted in the name of Smt. Garima Singh, petitioner herein against the opposite party which was decided on 27.3.1995. Her Counsel who inspected the file took all the necessary details of the suit and the proceedings and informed tine petitioner accordingly. 7. The case of the petitioner is that she never filed any suit under Hindu Marriage Act seeking a decree of divorce, dissolving her marriage performed in the year 1973, that she never resided at Sitapur with respondent as was stated in the petition. Completely shocked and unnerved at what had happened in her life, the petitioner, a mother of three grown up children, sought legal advice and on the basis of the same she filed a Suit No. 271 of 1995 for cancellation of the decree of divorce at Sitapur itself. In this case the petitioner has denied that she had any differences with her husband, that she last resided at Sitapur, that she ever engaged any Counsel at Sitapur or that she ever knew an Advocate by the name of V.K. Singh practising at Sitapur, that she took any steps whatsoever in the said suit as she has no knowledge of how the suit proceeded when she never filed the same. She very specifically denied that she ever visited Sitapur in her life before the filing of the Suit No. 271 of 1995 and pleaded that a systematic fraud has been practiced not only against her by someone impersonating her but also on the Court of Civil Judge, Sitapur, and the decree, of divorce has thus obviously been obtained by the said imposter in the name of the petitioner in collusion and conspiracy with the respondent. She has specifically denied ever residing at the address thatwas given in the first suit, i.e., that of one Sri N.K. Singh. She claimed that she always lived either at Allahabad at her parental house or at Amethi, District Sultanpur, her matrimonial home or at Lucknow with the respondent who was a Rajya Sabha Member. On such averments in the suit, it has been pleaded by her that the Courts at Sitapur had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit.Smt. Garima Singh vs Sri Sanjai Singh And Ors. on 27 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498780/ 2While disputing the valuation in the first suit, the subsequent suit has been valued at Rs. 50,000/- because the fictitious suit was so valued and she has prayed for the cancellation of the decree passed in the former suit. On these pleadings, the petitioner prayed for the setting aside of the decree passed in Suit No. 78 of 1995 obtained fraudulently by the husband. After filing the suit the petitioner was again advised by her lawyers that she could also invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the same Court which had passed the impugned decree under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground that a decree obtained by fraud was a nullity and could therefore be set-aside. Petitioner accordingly moved an application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the same Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) which was numbered as Misc. Case No. 23 of 1996, praying inter-alia for the setting aside of the ex-parte collusive and fraudulently obtained decree of divorce as well as the entire proceedings in Suit No. 78 of 1995. In this application all the attending circumstances which in the petitioner's opinion go to establish a case of fraud upon the Court are set out in great detail. According to her neither the petitioner nor the respondent appeared before the Court (as is revealed from the record of proceedings) and the Trial Court without adhering to the due procedure of law and the rules framed under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Family Courts' Act as also the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure passed the impugned decree in great haste. Violation of mandatory provisions of Section 23(2) of Hindu Marriage Actand Order 32 Rules 3 and 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure have been alleged. Since no effort was made by the learned Judge to assist the parties in arriving at a settlement/ reconciliation. According to her it is a suspicious circumstance that the suit was decreed within a month which is most unusual. It has also been stated by the petitioner that she never applied for the certified copy of the decree and everything has been done by some imposter impersonating Smt. Garima Singh. It was accordingly prayed in this application that the learned Court under its inherent powers be pleased to set aside/recall the orders dated 25.2.1995 by which the cognizance of the suit filed by some imposter was taken, the order dated 22.3.1995 by which the order to proceed ex-parte was passed and order dated 27.3.1995 by which the judgment and decree has been passed. This application was opposed by the respondent on the ground that the same is not maintainable and the only remedy available to the petitioner in me alleged facts and circumstances of the case is filing of a fresh suit, which has already been availed of by her, therefore, the application is liable to be rejected. Respondent chose not to file reply to this application on merits until the question of maintainability was decided. The learned Trial Court after hearing both the parties, rejected the said application on 19.2.1996 on the ground that it is not maintainable as such declined to consider the merits of the application. Aggrieved by the said rejection of the application, the petitioner has approached this Court by filing the present Civil Revision under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Article 227 of the Constitution of India with the prayer to set aside the impugned orders dated 12.2.1996 and 19.2.1996 passed by the learned First Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sitapur, and while treating the application as maintainable allow it on merits also thereby quashing the entire proceedings of the Suit No. 78 of 1995 and restore it to its original number to proceed in accordance with law. 8. Respondent has entered appearance. An application raising preliminary objection has been filed by the respondent before this Court with the prayer that the preliminary issue that present petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not maintainable before this Court be decided first. However, no reply on the merits of the case has been filed before this Court.Smt.

After marriage, the parties lived together at Maruthi Nilayam, 12-A, Venkateswara Street, Dhanalakshmi Colony, Vadapalani, Chennai  600 026 till 03.01.1996, the date on which she was taken by her father-in-law to her parents house. They lived in the aforesaid address along with her husband's parents, married sister with her husband and younger unmarried brother and sister in a joint family after marriage. On 19.11.1994 she was sent to her parents house for medical check up and treatment. Again she was brought back by her mother-in-law on 26.01.1995 from her parents house to Chennai and she lived in Chennai with the Respondent upto 12.03.1995, when she was sent back for delivery to her parents house. The Respondent/Husband visiting the Appellant/Wife on 27.05.1995 to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Again, the Respondent/Husband visited on 30.05.1995, when she delivered a male child. After delivery, on 13th day, Respondent/Husband came with his family members to the Appellant/Wife's parents house where she was staying after delivery. The Respondent/Husband visited the Appellant in August and September 1995 at her house at Hyderabad. She came back to Chennai on 04.10.1995 after her delivery and from then onwards she was living with the Respondent/Husband till 03.01.1996 together with the child. (b).The Appellant/Wife was always quite accommodative, adjusting and gave respect to Respondent/Husband's family members, fellow musicians and senior members of her husband's profession. She never detested the visitors nor troubled the nest for any matters. She was taken by her father-in-law on 03.01.1996 to her parents house without her consent and thereafter, the Respondent/Husband had not visited her. From 03.01.1996, the Respondent/Husband without any reasonable excuse and with a view to leave the matrimonial home, withdrew from the society of the Appellant/Wife. Her parents move to contact the Respondent/Husband and the family members to find a solution had not yielded any fruitful result. Even the common relatives and friends tried toU.Sree vs U.Srinivas on 26 September, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73219244/ 2bring about solution, but it ended in vain. Hence, she filed the petition praying for restitution of conjugal rights. 8.Counter Pleas: (a).The Respondent/Husband, in his counter, had stated that there was a total mental incompatibility between him and the Appellant /Wife. According to him, within a few weeks of marriage, the Appellant /Wife started finding fault with his life style, his daily routine, his likes and dislikes and constantly picked up quarrels on some pretext or other and throw tantrum when she did not had her way. His daily routine began in learning music lessons from his father and the Appellant/ Wife by interrupting them by hurling, abuses and screaming and shouting followed invariably by arguments and quarrels between the Appellant/Wife and the Respondent/Husband. The rehearsals would end abruptly. Occasionally, he would like the Appellant/Wife jointly in paying respects to the senior members of his profession, who either visit him or whom he visit or meet in public. The seeking of blessings from such elders was customary in music circles. But, the Appellant/ Wife started hurling abuses at him on such occasions and walked away from the scene much to his acute embarrassment. The Appellant/Wife behaved in a hard headed, arrogant, merciless, thoughtless and unbalanced manner, devoid of affection or any sense of respect or duty and subjecting the Respondent/Husband to a lot of embarrassment in private as well as in public and gave a beating to his reputation and image all of which constituted mental cruelty. He was conservative by nature and was an introvert who prefers to spend his leisure time quietly in the company of the Appellant/Wife and the child. (b).The Appellant/Wife called her parents to go over frequently to Madras and threatened him with proceedings under Indian Penal Code. The Appellant's father was an I.A.S. Officer in Vigilance Department in Government of Andhra Pradesh. At the instigation of Appellant/Wife, her father started threatening him that he would use the official machinery at his disposal to initiate several criminal proceedings against him for an alleged offence under the Indian Penal Code and Dowry Prohibition Act, if he had not towed the line of his wife. (c).The Appellant/Wife with her father's support became abnormally aggressive with the Respondent/Husband and never allowed him to go near her or their son. He was prevented from playing or feeding his son or accompanying her and her son on outdoor trips. Each day passed with the threat of the Appellant/Wife's father looming large over the Respondent/Husband. He was unable to take on the cruel behaviour of the Appellant/Wife and had not stopped her on 03.01.1996, when she expressed her desire to visit her parents for a couple of months. He had not stood in the way, when she packed her belongings and took away with some of the costly gifts presented to him in India and abroad in appreciation of his music and left the matrimonial home on 03.01.1996. Fearing for the physical safety of the Appellant/Wife and his child, the Respondent /Husband requested his father to escort the Appellant/Wife and the son to Hyderabad and entrusted both of them to the care and custody of her parents. Even while at her parents house in Andhra Pradesh, the Appellant/Wife through remote control continued to indulge in every sort of harassment and mental cruelty on the Respondent/Husband by threatening him through her father and other relatives and friends who began spreading rumours in India and abroad on his fidelity and character andU.Sree vs U.Srinivas on 26 September, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73219244/ 3","['9', '13', '7']"

The brief factual matrix of the case is as under. 3. The marriage between appellant, Mr.Anil Khatwani and respondent, Nistha Khatwani took place at Ajmer on 30/11/2002 as per Hindu rites and a son, Siddharth was born out of this wedlock on 12/5/2004. The parties are admittedly living separately since November, 2005 on account of various disputes and incompatibility and criminal complaint under Section 406 and 498-A IPC & under the provisions of Domestic Violence Act were also filed by the respondent wife, Smt.

However, since the efforts of reconciliation between the parties failed, a written compromise was arrived at between the parties on 3/1/2007 at Bhilwara and pursuant to that, the present petition under Section 13B of the Act was jointly filed by both the parties before the learned District Judge, Bhilwara, S.B.CIVIL MISC. APPEAL NO. 1250/2008 Anil Khatwani vs. Nistha Khatwani Judgment dt:10/5/2012 which was registered on the same day and was posted after statutory waiting period of six months on 5/7/2007. On subsequent dates fixed by the learned court below, the respondent wife was mostly not present before the court like on 23/7/2007, 8/8/2007, 5/11/2007 and 16/11/2007. On 11/1/2008 both the parties were not present before the court below and again on 4/2/2008, the appellant husband was present but respondent wife was not present. On 11/3/2008, the respondent wife seeking exemption for her appearance on 12/3/2008 before the court below, filed an application that she does not want to proceed further in this said case and the proceedings of the case deserve to be concluded at that stage itself. On 12/3/2008, the appellant husband also preferred an application that divorce decree by mutual consent in pursuance of petition under Section 13B of the Act jointly filed by both the parties on 3/1/2007 may be granted as the appellant husband has already paid a sum of Rs. 5 lacs by two Demand Drafts No.690031 dated 7/12/2006 of Rs.2.5 lacs and No. 690032 dated 7/12/2006 of Rs. 2.5 lacs drawn on Bank of Baroda to the respondent wife towards dowry items and future maintenance of herself and their son Siddharth and appellant husband also opposed the application dated 11/3/2008 filed by the respondent wife, seeking S.B.CIVIL MISC. APPEAL NO. 1250/2008 Anil Khatwani vs. Nistha Khatwani Judgment dt:10/5/2012 exemption to appear on 12/3/2008. However, 12/3/2008, the fact of filing of the application dated 11/3/2008 by the respondent wife that the proceedings may be concluded at this stage was noted by the court below and copy of the application filed by the appellant husband was given to the counsel for the respondent wife and the matter was adjourned to 10/4/2008 for reply to the said application and for presence of the parties, though the consent divorce decree could have been passed on 12/3/2008 itself. 4. On 10/4/2008, a new counsel appeared on behalf of respondent wife, Mr. Naresh Daad & he sought further time to file reply and matter was again adjourned to 13/5/2008, on which date again the said Advocate concerned sought further time and matter was adjourned to 29/5/2008. On 29/5/2008, the respondent wife filed reply to the application dated 12/3/2008 of the husband in which she expressed for the first time that the compromise filed on 3/1/2007 was signed by her under pressure and the amount of Rs.5 lacs paid was for dowry items, furniture, household articles and jewelery items of respondent Nishtha, whereas, no amount was paid for maintenance of respondent wife and her son. In para no. 3 of the said reply, the S.B.CIVIL MISC. APPEAL NO. 1250/2008 Anil Khatwani vs. Nistha Khatwani Judgment dt:10/5/2012 respondent wife has also stated that divorce decree cannot be granted by consent of only one party and she did not appear in the court on various dates as her advocate did not call her and she wants to withdraw her petition under Section 13B of the Act. In the meanwhile, on the basis of compromise dated 3/1/2007 on a non- judicial stamp paper of Rs.100/-, duly notarized on 3/1/2007, the parties also agreed to finish their criminal cases, namely; FIR No. 46/2006 under Section 408 and 498-A IPC and case no. 496/2006 (Nishtha Khatwani vs. Anil Khatwani) under Section 18 to 22 of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.Anil Khatwani vs Smt.Nisha Khatwani on 10 May, 2012 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/60933086/ 2Taking note of the compromise dated 3/1/2007, a coordinate bench of this court also allowed criminal misc. petition no. 36/2007 (Anil Khatwani & ors. vs. State of Raj. & Ors.) on 28/5/2007 following the Supreme Court decision in the case of B.S.Joshi & ors. vs. State of Haryana - (2003) 4 SCC 675 and observed as under:- ""Taking into consideration the statement made by the learned counsel for the parties, I am satisfied that the parties have genuinely settled their matrimonial dispute and now they have no grievance against each other.

The said compromise along with receipts of respondent wife - Nishtha Khatwani indicating the receipt of various jewelery and household articles and amount of Rs.5 lacs by two Demand Drafts were also produced before the learned court below. 6. However, the learned trial court by the impugned order dated 14/7/2008 held that with the withdrawal of the consent to the divorce by mutual consent by the respondent wife filed on 11/3/2008 within 14 months and 08 days of filing of the petition on 3/1/2007, the petition under Section 13B of the Act could not allowed and consequently the same deserves to be dismissed and the said petition was accordingly dismissed.

In this matter, which is presented as an appeal against an order of the Family Court, Bangalore, granting interim maintenance to the respondent on an application presented under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the following question of law arises for consideration: ""Whether an appeal lies against an order made by the Family Court on an application presented under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act granting interim maintenance under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act?"" 2. The facts of the case, in brief, are as follow ; A petition presented under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for grant of a decree of divorce against his wife - the respondent, is pending before the Family Court, Bangalore. During the pendency of that petition, the respondent made an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for grant of alimony pendente lite and also to direct the appellant to pay the amount required for the legal expenses. The petition was originally presented before the City Civil Court and the proceedings stood transferred to the Family Court after it was established. The Family Court allowed the application by its order dated 4-9-1987 and directed the appellant to pay an interim maintenance of Rs. 200-00 per month and also an amount of Rs. 1,500-00 towards legal expenses to the respondent. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant has presented this petition under Section 19(1) of the Family Courts Act ('the Act' for short). The appeal is not registered as the office has raised an objection that in view of Section 19 of the Act, the appeal is not maintainable. It is in these circumstances, the question of law, set out above, arises for consideration. 3. Sri G.S.Rao, the learned Counsel for the appellant, and Sri B.P. Holla, Senior Counsel who was directed to assist the Court as Amicus Curiae, have addressed their arguments with reference to the question arising for consideration. 4. In order to appreciate the question arising for consideration in the light of the arguments addressed by the learned Counsel, it is necessary to set out the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It reads: ""24. MAINTENANCE PENDENTE LITE AND EXPENSES OF PROCEEDINGS - Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceedings, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of proceeding and monthly during the proceeding such sum as having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent it may seem to the Court to be reasonable.""T.V. Satyanarayana vs Subba Aruna Meenakshi on 26 February, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/610193/ 1The above provision confers power on the Court having jurisdiction to entertain petitions under the various provisions of the Act to make an order directing a party to pay interim maintenance and also to direct such party to pay the expenses required for the litigation. Such an order continues to be in force till the termination of the main proceedings and comes to an end with the disposal of the main case. 5. Even before the coming into force of the Act, a question had arisen in the case of SUBHASINI v. B.R. UMAKANTH, Subhasini v. Umakanth (Ref), as to whether a revision was maintainable against an order of the Family Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that no appeal was maintainable. This Court considered the question in the light of the amendment to Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act by Act 68 of 1976. The relevant portion of the judgment reads: ""4.....Section 28 of the said Act was amended by Act 68 of 1976. As the provisions stood earlier thereto, an appeal was maintainable against every order made under the Act except in respect of order for costs. But by virtue of the amendment, an appeal was provided against all the decrees made by the Court in a proceeding under the Act except that no appeal was permissible on the subject of costs only. So far as the orders were concerned. Section 28(2) provided that orders made by Court in any proceedings under the Act under Section 25 or Section 26 and if they were not interim orders, were appealable.  xxx                      xxx                       xxx The revision petition was therefore maintainable. No appeal was competent against the order made by the Civil Judge."" Thus, the Division Bench held that no appeal was maintainable against an interlocutory order made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act end consequently the revision petition was maintainable 6. The Act has been enacted by the Parliament and its Preamble indicate that it is a law intended to provide for the establishment of Family Courts with a view to promote conciliation in, and secure speedy settlement of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith. The relevant part of Section 7 of the Act which confers jurisdiction on the Family Court reads: ""7. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Family Court shall - (a) have and exercise all the jurisdiction exercisable by any District Court or any subordinate Civil Court under any law for the time being in force in respect of suits and proceedings of the nature referred to in the Explanation; andT.V. Satyanarayana vs Subba Aruna Meenakshi on 26 February, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/610193/ 2(b) be deemed, for the purposes of exercising such jurisdiction under such law, to be a District Court or, as the case may be, such subordinate Civil Court for the area to which the jurisdiction of the Family Court extends.  xxx                      xxx                       xxx (2) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Family Court shall also have and exercise - (a) the jurisdiction exercisable by a Magistrate of the first class under Chapter IX (relating to order for maintenance of wife, children and parents) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and (b) such other jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by any other enactment."" Section 8 of the Act excludes the jurisdiction of all the Courts on the establishment of a Family Court for any specified area and the said Section also provides for the transfer of proceedings to the Family Court, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court and which immediately before its establishment, were pending before any other Court. It is by virtue of this Section the proceedings instituted by the appellant stood transferred to the Family Court. Section 19 of the Act reads: ""19(1) Save as provided in Sub-section (2) and notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 or in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or in any other law, an appeal shall lie from every judgment or order, not being an interlocutory order of a Family Court to the High Court both on facts and on law.  xxx                      xxx                       xxx (4) Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie to any Court from any judgment, order or decree of a Family Court."" As can be seen from Section 19, an appeal lies to the High Court against every judgment or order made by the Family Court provided it is not an interlocutory order. Sub-section (4) further provides that no appeal or revision shall lie to any Court from any judgment or order or decree of a Family Court. If Sub-section (4) had not been there, the decision of this Court in the case of Subhasini, Subhasini v. Umakanth (Ref) would have held the field and consequently no appeal would be maintainable before this Court against an interlocutory order made by the Family Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, but a revision petition under Section 115 would have beenT.V.

The appellant wife has preferred this appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 12th Court, Alipore dissolving her marriage with the respondent hushand under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The learned Additional District Judge, however, dismissed the prayer of the respondent husband for annulling the marriage of the parties on the ground specified in Section 12(1)(b) of the said Act. The respondent husband has also filed a cross-objection against the said dismissal of his prayer for annulment of their marriage. 2. On 3rd March, 1976 the marriage between the appellant and the respondent according to Hindu rites took place at 50/1, Shib Tbakurbari Lane, P. S. Behala, District 24 Parganas. On 21st Sept., 1976 Dilip Kumar Bag, the respondent herein, had presented in the Court of the District Judge, 24 Parganas his petition for annulment of his marriage with the appellant under Section 12 and in the alternative for dissolution of the said marriage under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Although the said petition for divorce was presented by the respondent husband before even one year had elapsed since the date of his marriage with the respondent, he did not make any application under the proviso to Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act for allowing him to present the said petition for dissolution of marriage. He did not plead any case of exceptional hardship to him or of exceptional depravity on the part of his wife. Therefore, it is patent that on the date of the presentation of the said petition, the Court below was not competent to entertain the respondent husband's petition for dissolution of his marriage with the appellant by a decree of divorce. But the said bar under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not apply to the respondent's petition for annulling the marriage under Section 12(1) of the said Act. It is somewhat strange that none of the parties had drawn the attention of the Court below to the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and overlooking the said provisions, the Court below has dissolved by a decree of divorce the marriage between the appellant and the respondent. 3. We find from the records that on 1st April, 1977 the present appellant had filed her written statement in the present case and on 15th April, 1977 the trial Court had framed the issues. On 14th May, 1977 the respondent husband, who was the petitioner in the Court below, purported to file an application under Order 6, Rule 17 of the Code read with Section 39 (2) of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976. He prayed that ht might be allowed to amend his main application 'with a view to give further details and to avail of the reliefs provided in the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976'. It was further averred ""that the main application was drafted in 'hot haste', due to oversight and inadvertence, proper details of happenings"" were not given in the main application. It may be pointed out that the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 68 of 1976) was published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary Issue dated May 27, 1976 and on 21st Sept., 1976 the respondent husband had presented his petition for annulment and in the alternative for dissolution of the marriage with the appellant wife. Therefore, the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 39 ofSmritikana Bag vs Dilip Kumar Bag on 28 August, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1549156/ 1the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 were not attracted to the facts of the present case. But, undoubtedly the Court below had jurisdiction to allow amendments prayed for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. The Court below had allowed the amendments prayed for. Therefore, the present appellant had filed an additional written statement. 4. Mr. Bakshi, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent husband, has not disputed that on the original date of his client's petition under Section 13(1)(iii), the trial Court was not competent to entertain it, but he has submitted that after expiry of more than one year from the date of marriage, the respondent husband had applied, inter alia, for amendment of his petition under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act and we ought to treat the date on which the said amendment application was filed as the date of presentation of the instant petition for divorce. According to Mr. Bakshi, learned advocate for the respondent husband, therefore, the Court below was competent to pass the impugned decree for dissolution of the marriage between the parties. 5. A Hindu marriage no longer creates indissoluble ties' between the husband and the wife; and Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 sets out grounds of divorce. But the legislature by enacting Section 14 has imposed a ban upon presenting a petition for divorce unless one year has elapsed from the date of marriage. In case of exceptional hardship to the petitioner or exceptional depravity of the respondent, the Court under proviso to Section 14(1) of the Act may, however, allow a petition under Section 13 to be filed within one year from the date of marriage. The sub-section (1) of Section 14 begins with the expression 'notwithstanding anything contained in this Act ... .. ...'. Therefore, in spite of other provisions including those of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court cannot entertain any petition for divorce within one year of marriage. The suit is to be regarded as not entertained if it is thrown out at its inception without decision on its merits. The inability to entertain means not inability to grant relief to the plaintiff but inability to give him a trial at ail (vide observations of B. K. Mukherjea and Ellias, IT. in Nakul Chandra v. Shyama-pada Ghose, AIR 1945 Cal 381 regarding the scope of Section 37-A (3) of the Bengal Agricultural Debtors Act). 6. The object of Section 14(i) is clearly to prevent the parties from presenting a divorce petition without giving a trial to their marriage for ""at least one year. Thus, Section 14 has been enacted ""with the object of preventing hasty suits for dissolution of marriage"" (see observations of Lord Denning in Bowman v. Bowman, (1949) 2 All ER 127 : 1949 P. 353-356, with reference to the provisions of Section 1(1) of Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, which was replaced by Matrimonial Cases Act, 1950, Section 2; thereafter, by Matrimonial Cases Act, 1965, Section 2 and thereafter, by Matrimonial Cases Act, 1973, Section 3. See also Rayden on Divorce (13th Edition), Vol. 1, Chapter XI, Sections I and II, pages 316-320). Rayden on Divorce (13th Edition) in a note under Chapter XI, Section I page 349, has referred to Bamford v. Bamford, 1956 CLY 2831, where the marriage took place on 27th June, 1956 and it was held that the earliest date on which the petition could have been filed was 28th June, 1956 and accordingly the petition was dismissed). We agree with the observations made in Meganatha Naya-gar v. Shrimathi Susheela, , that Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act is grounded on public policy and that it provides restrictions upon hasty recourse to legal proceeding without making any real effort to save the marriage.Smritikana Bag vs Dilip Kumar Bag on 28 August, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1549156/ 26-A. We have already noted that the present respondent husband did not make any application before the trial Court for permission to present his petition for divorce within one year of his marriage with the present appellant. He did not plead or prove his exceptional hardship or exceptional depravity on the part of the wife. Therefore, the proviso to Section 14(1) was not attracted to the present case. Further, even in a case where such permission under Section 14(1) proviso is obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of the nature of the case, the Court has been given a discretion either to direct that the decree for dissolution shall not have effect till the expiry of one year from the date of marriage or to dismiss the petition without prejudice to file a fresh petition after expiry of one year from the marriage. 7. The decision of the Division Bench of Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Sawita Devi v. Pran Nath, AIR 1967 J & K 89 is distinguishable on facts. Without obtaining leave under the proviso to Section 14, a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was presented within three years of marriage. The learned District Judge while allowing the amendment of the said petition granted leave under proviso to Section 14(j)of the Act (as the said provision stood before the amendment of the Marriage Laws Regulation Act, 1976). The learned Judges of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court did not agree with the trial Court that the case was a fit one for granting such leave but accepted the submission of the learned lawyer for the husband that the application in question was a composite one under Sections 10 and 13 of the Act. The learned Judges further applied the principles that in order to shorten the course of litigation and to do complete justice between the parties, the Court ought to take notice of subsequent events. According to the Division Bench, in the interest of the parties and also for doing substantial justice, the petitioner husband ought to be allowed to amend his petition subject to payment of costs. 8. The respondent husband's petition under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was not only prematurely filed, but also the evidence about appellant wife's mental condition covered such a short period that it is not possible to satisfactorily decide whether or not she was really of unsound mind or suffered from any mental disorder of a kind and of such an extent that the petitioner husband was not reasonably expected to live with her. 9. Even after the amendment of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, only in cases of certain kinds of mental disorder of the respondent, the Court under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act may dissolve marriage by decree of divorce. The petitioner by merely proving that the respondent is of unsound mind or suffers from mental disorder cannot obtain divorce. The petitioner would be required to prove that the respondent had been incurably of unsound mind. Alternatively, he ought to prove that the respondent to the petition under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act had been suffering continuously or intermittently from mental disorder which according to- Explanation (a) of Clause (iii) of Section 13(1) means ""mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other disorder or disability of mind and includes schizophrenia"". The Explanation (b) to Clause (iii) of Section 13(1) gives the meaning of the expression ""psychopathic disorder"". No doubt, it is no longer relevant whether such psychopathic disorder requires or is susceptible to medical treatment. But marriage could be dissolved only by proving that the respondent was suffering from some form of mental disorder which was of such a kind and of such an extent that the petitioner could not reasonably be expectedSmritikana Bag vs Dilip Kumar Bag on 28 August, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1549156/ 3","['13', '12', '2', '1', '3','14']"

The brief facts are that the appellant in Second Appeal No. 88/1984 viz. Gayabai w/o Panditrao Kalure (original plaintiff) had claimed that she was a legally wedded wife of Panditrao Chimajj Kalure (original defendant). Gayabai had filed a Regular Civil Suit No. 193/1969 for grant of maintenance from Panditrao Chimaji Kalure and also claimed maintenance for the previous three years. In the said Regular Civil Suit, Gayabai had contended that they have been married for 11 years an4 that she has been living with her husband for a period of five years and eight months. In the year 1963, Panditrao Kalure had obtained a job as a teacher and he had declined to take her with him at the place of service at village Bhogalwadi. Gayabai had alleged that Panditrao Kalure, had ill-treated her. It appears that said Gayabai had also filed an application for maintenance under Section 488 of Criminal Procedure Code. In the said proceedings Panditrao Kalure had produced a Divorce Deed, mentioning that the said marriage was mutually dissolved between the parties by consent on 5/5/1967. The Criminal Court had accepted the said Divorce Deed and had rejected the application of Gayabai for maintenance, in the aforesaid suit, Gayabai had contended that she had never given such a divorce and there, was no customary practice in her community to enter into any such Divorce Deed and also contended that the said Divorce Deed was a false and fabricated document, as such, same ought to be declared as null and void. 2. The main contention of Gayabai was that her husband was not maintaining her and that she was being maintained by her parents. She had also alleged that Panditrao Kalure receives a monthly salary of Rs. 200/- and that he is a member of a joint family which owns 45 acres of land and out of which 10 acres are irrigated land. Under these circumstances, Gayabai had claimed Rs. 100/- p.m. as maintenance and Rs. 3,600/- as past maintenance. She had also prayed for a declaration that the Divorce Deed dated 5/5/1967 to be declared null and void, being a false and fabricated document. She had also sought a declaration that she is a legally wedded wife of Panditrao Kalure. 3. The defendant Panditrao Kalure had filed his Written Statement contending that as per the prevailing custom, he had divorced his wife Gayabai by executing Divorce Deed on 5/5/1967. He had also contended that the marriage had taken place almost 15 years back when both of them were minors. He had strongly disputed that Gayabai was residing with him for five years and eight months, On the contrary, he had contended that Gayabai hardly resided with him for a period of two years or so after their marriage. Panditrao Kalure had strongly disputed that he had ever ill-treated Gayabai and he had strongly denied that he had ever deserted her and driven her out of the house. 4. Panditrao Kalure had contended that Gayabai very rarely came to his house at Ramwadi while the marriage was subsisting and in fact, her brother and other person used to bring her and she would not come on her own and she was very unwilling to come to the residence of Panditrao Kalure. Even the parents of Gayabai were not willing to send her, when Panditrao Kalure was living at Ramwadi, In view of this behaviour of Gayabai, finally, Gayabai and her parents had decided to take a divorcePanditrao Chimaji Kalure vs Gayabai Panditrao Kalure on 27 February, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1616455/ 1from Panditrao Kalure. The defendant Panditrao Kalure had contended that accordingly a special messenger by name Ramrao s/o Danreddy, r/o Yellamwadi was sent seeking a divorce from the defendant. Panditrao had contended that the Divorce Deed in favour of Panditrao Kalure was scribed by the brother of Gayabai viz. Ramrao Narsingrao Tandre and the said Divorce Deed was also attested by some witnesses. Panditrao Kalure contends that the Divorce Deed was executed as per the existing and prevailing custom in (heir community. 5. The trial Court, after hearing the panics had held that the plaintiff Gayabai had proved ill-treatment and also had proved that Panditrao Kalure had neglected and refused to maintain her. Accordingly, the trial Court had held that Gayabai was entitled to receive maintenance @ Rs. 60/- p.m. and also had granted, past maintenance for a period of three years. 6. Panditrao being aggrieved by the order of the trial Court, filed a Regular Civil Appeal No. 88/1975 in the Court of District Judge, Beed. The learned District Judge, Beed, had allowed the appeal and remanded the matter to the trial Court for a decision on an important issue, as to whether the marriage between the parties was subsisting on the date of filing of the suit and if the Deed of Divorce, produced by the appellant Panditrao Kalure was held to be proved, the relationship of husband and wife between the parties would come to an end and consequently, Gayabai would not be entitled to claim any maintenance. Thereafter, the plaintiff Gayabai had preferred an appeal against the said order of the District Judge, Beed, in Regular Civil Appeal No. 88/1975, before this Court in Appeal No. 205/1978. This Court, after upholding the order of remand of the District Court, Beed, directed the trial Court to record the evidence of the finger print expert and send the matter to the lower Appellate Court for its consideration. The trial Court had recorded the evidence of the finger print expert and had sent the same to the District Court. Under these circumstances, the lower Appellate Court viz. the District Judge, Beed, took up this matter and had framed the following points:-- (1) Does the Defendant prove that there was a divorce between the parties ? (2) Does the Plaintiff prove that she was ill-treated and driven out by the defendant and that he has neglected or refused to maintain her ? (3) Is she entitled for maintenance and if so, what should be the quantum ? (4) If yes, whether she is entitled for back maintenance ? (5) What orders ? The learned District Judge, Deed, has answered first point in affirmative, second point in negative and so far as the third point is concerned, it was held that the Plaintiff Gayabai was entitled to receive maintenance and that she would be entitled to get Rs. 60/- p.m. by way of maintenance. So far as point no. 4 is concerned, the learned District Judge, Beed, has held that the Plaintiff Gayabai was not entitled for any back maintenance.Panditrao Chimaji Kalure vs Gayabai Panditrao Kalure on 27 February, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1616455/ 27. The learned District judge, after the aforesaid remand and the evidence of the finger print expert Shri A.N. Mujumdar, by a detailed examination of the same, by a cogent and proper reasoning, came to a conclusion that the thumb impression on the said document i.e. Divorce Deed was that of Gayabai. Accordingly, the finding was that the defendant Panditrao Kalure had proved the thumb impression on the Divorce Deed (Exh. 50) was that of Gayabai, accordingly there was a divorce between the parties as per the customary practice. 8. It appears that there was a contention raised by the learned counsel appearing for Gayabai that the said thumb impression on the Divorce Deed (Exh. 50) was not a voluntary one. The learned District Judge holds that all throughout Gayabai had contended that her brother had not obtained her thumb impression, whereas, it was sought to be argued that the thumb impression was not a voluntary one, which contention was rejected as the same was totally contradictory to each other, in the sense, if the case of Gayabai was that she had never given her thumb impression on the said Divorce Deed, then there was no question of her thumb impression being not a voluntary thumb impression. Ultimately, the learned District Judge, upholds the contention of Panditrao Kalure that the Divorce Deed was executed and Gayabai had affixed her thumb impression on the same. 9. The learned District Judge has, after appreciating all the evidence on record, came to the conclusion that Gayabai had failed to prove that her husband Panditrao Kalure was ill-treating her or that he had deserted or neglected her. On the contrary, the learned District Judge holds that Gayabai had agreed to a divorce on her own and that there was no ill-treatment. Finally, the learned District Judge holds that the Divorce Deed between Gayabai and Panditrao Kalure was established and proved. 10. The learned District Judge, thereafter, went into the issue of grant of maintenance. The learned District Judge after referring to the provisions of Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as well as Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 and also a judgment of this Court in the case of Govindrao Ranoji Musale v. Anandibai Govindrao Musale and Anr., 1977 Mh.LJ. 144 and also ,another judgment of this Court in the case of Smt. Rajeshbai and Ors. v. Smt. Shantabai, ; holds that in view of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and in view of the provisions of Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure, the Court had the right to grant maintenance, that is to say, the learned Judge had considered aforesaid judgments and had concluded that the petition for maintenance under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 can be considered even under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for grant of maintenance. To put in other words, the learned District Judge is of the view that even if Gayabai is held to be divorced, she is still entitled to claim maintenance, in view of Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 r/w Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the lower Appellate Court had allowed the appeal filed by Gayabai and had directed Panditrao Kalure to pay Rs. 60/- p.m. from the date of institution of the suit. However, that part of the order of the trial Court, wherein, it was held that Gayabai was entitled to recover the back maintenance for the last three years, was set aside. 11. Aggrieved thereby, Panditrao had filed a Second Appeal No. 73/1984, before this Court challenging the direction of the lower Appellate Court, directing Panditrao to pay Rs. 60/- p.m. from the date of institution of the suit.Panditrao Chimaji Kalure vs Gayabai Panditrao Kalure on 27 February, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1616455/ 3","[ '15', '25', '18']"

The instant application under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code is directed against the order dated 30.11.96 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Seventh Court, Uluberia in Misc. Case No. 42 of 1995. 2. The said case arose out of an application filed by the opposite party No. 1, Anita Ghosh under Section 125, Cr.P.C. The petitioner is her husband. Their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu rites and customs on 18.2.92. After the marriage, they lived together in the matrimonial home for some time. The opposite party No. 2 being infertile was undergoing medical treatment. There was no issue born out of their marriage. The opposite party No. 2 abandoned her matrimonial home on 30.10.94. The petitioner filed a matrimonial suit for divorce against the opposite party No. 2, being Mat. Suit No. 321 of 1994 in Second Court of Additional District Judge, Hooghly. The opposite party No. 2 lodged a complaint on 25.1.95 in Chandernagore Court alleging matrimonial cruelty against the petitioner. The opposite party No. 2 filed an application under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code praying for maintenance allowance against the petitioner in the Court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Uluberia. Both the matrimonial suit and the complaint case are pending. In the matrimonial suit, the opposite party No. 2 had obtained an order being order No. 17 dated 8.7.96 directing the petitioner to pay alimony pendente lite at the rate of Rs. 700/- per month as well as litigation cost of Rs. 1500/- to the opposite party No. 2 and the petitioner has been paying the alimony pendente lite in terms of that order. During the trial of that case under Section 125, Cr.P.C., the petitioner gave evidence in support of the payment of alimony at the rate of Rs. 700/- per month to the opposite party No. 2. But the learned Magistrate by his impugned judgment and order disposed of the case under Section 125, Cr.P.C. awarding maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs. 800/- in favour of the opposite party No. 2 without, however, considering the fact that the opposite party No. 2 was already receiving a sum of Rs. 700/- towards alimony pendente lite by virtue of the order passed in the matrimonial suit, as a result of which, the opposite party No. 2 is getting maintenance allowance from the petitioner twice a month. 3. Mr. A. Goswami, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the learned Magistrate ought to have made provision in the impugned order for adjustment of Rs. 700 /-, the amount which the opposite party No. 2 is getting by way of maintenance pendente lite in terms of order dated 8.7.96 passed in the matrimonial suit against the amount of Rs. 800/- which he awarded in her favour towards her maintenance allowance. If this adjustment is not allowed, the petitioner will be unjustly saddled with a liability to make payment of maintenance allowance to the opposite party No. 2 twice a month. Accordingly, Mr. Goswami wants this Court to modify the impugned order by making provision for adjustment of the maintenance pendente lite.Sailendra Nath Ghosh vs State Of West Bengal And Anr. on 14 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/273103/ 14. Mr. Goswami placed his reliance on two Single Bench decisions of our High Court. One is reported in 96 CWN 861 in the case of Gosai Ch. Das v. Beauty Das and State of W.B., and the other is a subsequent unreported decision dated 16.6.96 in Criminal Revision No. 2504 of 1995 in the case of Manoj Kr. Chowdhury v. Jharna Chowdhury. 5. Mr. Amit Talukdar, appearing for the opposite party No. 2, sought to resist the claim for adjustment. He argued that the two proceedings, namely the proceeding under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and the proceeding under Section 125, Cr.P.C. are two different proceedings. The order granting maintenance pendente lite in the matrimonial suit is not a final determination so as to be entitled to any serious weight in the proceeding under Section 125, Cr.P.C. The mere fact that the opposite party No. 2 is receiving maintenance pendente lite from the Matrimonial Court cannot disentitle her to the order of maintenance allowance from the Magisterial Court under Section 125, Cr.P.C. Mr. Talukdar also submits that the two decisions cited on behalf of the petitioner must be construed as per inquirium inasmuch as the Supreme Court decision in the case of Ramesh Chander v. Veena Kaushal, reported in 1979 Cr.L.J. 3 corresponding to has not been considered or referred to in the said two decisions and as such, the said two decisions will be of no avail to the petitioner in claiming adjustment. Mr. Talukdar relies on the aforesaid Supreme Court decision as well as the decision of Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in 1996 Cr.L.J. 2284, T. Rajender Singh v. Maya Devi. 6. In the Supreme Court case of Ramesh Chander (supra), the husband sought divorce through the Civil Court and the wife claimed maintenance through the Criminal Court. As an interim measure, the District Court awarded maintenance and the High Court fixed the rate at Rs. 400/- per month. Meanwhile, the Magistrate, on the evidence before him, ordered ex-parte, monthly maintenance at the rate of Rs. 1,000/- for the wife and her two children together. Two points were urged before the Supreme Court on behalf of the husband. First, the Civil Court's determination of the quantum is entitled to serious weight and the Criminal Court in its summary decision fell into an error in ignoring the former. The second point that was urged was that the awardable maximum for the wife and children as a whole under Section 125 of the Code was Rs. 500/- having regard to the text of the Section. 7. The Supreme Court virtually answered the first point only at paragraphs 6 and ^ thus: ""Broadly stated and as an abstract proposition, it is valid to assert that a final determination of a civil right by a Civil Court must prevail against a like decision by a Criminal Court. But here two factors make the principle inapplicable. Firstly, the direction by the Civil Court is not a final determination under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act but an order pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable. Secondly, this amount does not include the claim for maintenance of the children although the order does advert to the fact that the respondent has their custody. This incidental direction is no comprehensive adjudication. Therefore, barring marginal relevance for the Magistrate it does not bar his jurisdiction to award a higher maintenance. We cannot, therefore, fault the Magistrate for giving Rs. 100/- on this score"".Sailendra Nath Ghosh vs State Of West Bengal And Anr. on 14 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/273103/ 28. The Supreme Court appears to have dealt with the second point in die remaining paragraphs of the reported judgment. While dealing with the question of awardable maximum under Section 125 and interpreting the meaning of expression ""in the whole"" appearing in that Section, the Supreme Court made the following observations : ""This provision of Section 125, Cr.P.C. is a measure of social justice and specially enacted to protect women and children and falls within the constitutional sweep of Article 15(3) reinforced by Article 39. It also observed that the brooding presence of the constitutional empathy for the weaker sections like women and children must inform interpretation if it had to have social relevance. So viewed, it is possible to be selective in picking out that interpretation out of two alternatives which advances the cause - the cause of the derelicts"". 9. In our case, we are not concerned with any such interpretation. No question had really arisen in the Supreme Court case as to whether the husband was entitled to any adjustment of the amount of maintenance allowance life awarded by the Matrimonial Court against the maintenance allowance awarded by the Criminal Court under Section 125, Cr.P.C. The Supreme Court enunciated the abstract principle that a final determination of a civil right by a Civil Court must prevail against a like decision by the Criminal Court. But the Supreme Court made that principle inapplicable to that case for two reasons. One is that the direction by the Matrimonial Court was only an order pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act to pay not only maintenance but also the expenses of the proceeding and was not a final determination under me Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. The second reason that weighed with the Apex Court in making the principle inapplicable was that the amount awarded by the Matrimonial Court did not include the claim for maintenance of the children. In our case, the order that was passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act directed the payment of Rs. 700/ - exclusively towards maintenance allowance which did not include any expense of the proceeding since the said order directed the payment of a separate amount towards the expenses of the proceeding. Moreover, the sum of Rs. 700/- awarded by way of maintenance was meant for maintenance of the Opposite party- wife alone and not of any other children since it is admitted that there was no issue born out of the marriage between the petitioner and the opposite party No. 2. It is with reference to the facts of the case of Ramesh Chandra (supra), that the Supreme Court did not fault the Magistrate for giving lis. 1,000/- towards monthly maintenance for the wife and two children together holding inter alia that the order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not bar the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to award a higher maintenance, put it must be pointed put here that the Apex Court while making the observation at paragraph 7 did not categorically hold that the order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act was totally irrelevant vis-a-vis the order under Section 125, Cr.P.C. It is significant to note here that the Apex Court used the expressions ""barring marginal relevance for the Magistrate"" at para graphs 7 of the reported judgment. It suggests that the Apex Court did consider the order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act to be of some relevance for the Magistrate, however, marginal it might be, while he exercises his jurisdiction to award maintenance under Section 125, Cr.P.C. 10. In our case, the husband petitioner has not at all challenged the jurisdiction of the Magistrate in awarding a higher maintenance of Rs. 800/- as against the lower amount of Rs. 700/- awarded pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In Ramesh Chancier's case (supra), no question of any adjustment of maintenance pendente Ute under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act against the maintenance awarded under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. was specially raised or fell forSailendra Nath Ghosh vs State Of West Bengal And Anr. on 14 August, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/273103/ 3","['24', '12']"

This appeal is arising out of a judgment and decree dated 6.9.1995 and 20.9.1995 respectively passed by the 2nd Additional District Judge at Barasat in Matrimonial Suit No. 33 of 1992 dissolving the marriage between the appellant and respondent. 2. The marriage between the appellant (hereinafter referred to as wife) and the respondent (hereinafter referred to as husband) was solemnised on 21.6.1991 according to Hindu rites at Ichapur within the State of West Bengal. After the marriage both the husband and wife resided together at flat No. 5, 37/1, Vivekananda Road, Calcutta-35. The said flat was comprising of two bed rooms, one dining room, one kitchen, two bathrooms and one balcony. On 29.6.1991 both the husband and wife left for Ranchi for 'dwira gaman"". Wife's father resides at Ranchi. On 8.7.1991 both the husband and wife returned to Calcutta from Ranchi. On 11.8.1991 the wife left for Ranchi to spend the month of Bhadra with her parents at Ranchi. Thereafter some letters were exchanged between the husband and the wife and also between the father of the husband and father of the wife. It appears that the first letter of the wife dated 17.8.1991 was written to the husband which was received by the husband on 20.8.1991 and thereafter in August, 91 the husband sent a reply to the wife. On 11.9.1991 the wife wrote the second letter and on 29.9.1991 the husband sent the reply of the second letter. On 3.10.1991 wife's father wrote a letter to the father of the husband. On 31.7.1991 husband's father wrote a letter to the wife's father. Details to these letters will be discussed lateron. On 30.11.1991 the husband filed an application under Sections 14(1) and 14(2) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Leave was granted by the Court and the application under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed by the husband. On 23.12.1991 the wife filed an application under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code at Ranchi. On 27.1.1992 wife filed a suit under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 at Ranchi. On 16.6.1992 wife filed a complaint case under Sections 498A, 406 of I.P.C. and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 at Ranchi. On 20.9.1995 decree was passed under Section 13(1)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 dissolving the marriage between the husband and wife. 3. Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 reads as follows: ""14. No petition for divorce to be presented within one year of marriage.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, it shall not be competent for any Court to entertain any petition for dissolution of a marriage by a decree of divorce, (unless at the date of the presentation of the petition one year has elapsed) since the date of the marriage : Provided that the Court may, upon application made to it in accordance with such rules as may be made by the High Court in that behalf, allow a petition to be presented (before one year has elapsed) since the date of the marriage on the ground that the case is one of exceptional hardship to theManisha Jha (Smt.) vs Kunal Kanti Jha on 21 January, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1626097/ 1petitioner or of exceptional depravity on the part of the respondent, but if it appears to the Court at the hearing of the petition that the petitioner obtained leave to present the petition by any misrepresentation or concealment of the nature of the case, the Court may, if it pronounces a decree, do so subject to the condition that the decree shall not have effect until after the (expiry of the one year) from the date of the marriage or may dismiss the petition without prejudice to any petition which may be brought after the (expiration of the said one year) upon the same or substantially the same facts as those alleged in support of the petition so dismissed. (2) In disposing of any application under this section for leave to present a petition for divorce before the (expiration of one year) from the date of the marriage, the Court shall have regard to the interests of any children of the marriage and to the question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the (said one year.)"" 4. A Division Bench of this High Court in an appeal from Original Decree No. 73 of 1987 Rabindra Nath Mukherjee v. Smt. Iti Mukherjee alias Chatterjee, in their judgment dated 22.1.1991, inter alia, held as follows: ""I have already indicated that, in my view, the utility of the provision of Section 14 is very much doubtful. And the observations of the Law Commission of India, extracted hereinabove, also go to show that in the view of the Law Commission also, the provisions serve no useful purpose, so much so, to warrant deletion. It may be wrong, but I have no doubt that if a legislative provision is that useless, it should, so long it exists, be construed to be directory and no mandatory, unless such construction is not at all reason-ably possible. I would accordingly be inclined to hold that the provisions of Section 14 are not mandatory as in my view the contrary construction is not irresistible."" 5. In the aforesaid case the Division Bench of this High Court, inter alia, considered Section 14(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not considered by the Division Bench. Subsection (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down that in disposing of any application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act for leave to present a petition for divorce before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage the Court shall have regard to the interests of any children of the marriage and to the question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said one year. Family being the nucleus of the society if families are broken it is sure to have a telling effect upon the society. Therefore, every effect should be made to avoid breaking down of families. All effort should be made for reconciliation of the dispute between the husband and wife to avoid breaking down of a family. That is why Sub-section (2) of Section 14 of Hindu Marriage Act was enacted laying down that the Court shall have regard to the interests of any children of the marriage and to the question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage while disposing of any application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act for leave to present a petition for divorce before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage. The use of the word shall has made the provision mandatory. Therefore, it is bounden duty of the Court, while disposing of an application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act to have regard to the interests of any children of the marriage and to theManisha Jha (Smt.) vs Kunal Kanti Jha on 21 January, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1626097/ 2question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said one year. It should be apparent from the face of the order passed by the Court under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act that the Court had regard to the interests of any child or children of the marriage and to the question whether there is a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said one year. 6. On 30.11.1991 the Court while disposing of the application under Section 14(1) and (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 passed the following order : ""Petitioner files an application under Section 14(1) and (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 supported by an affidavit praying for leave of the Court to present the suit for reasons stated therein. Perused the record including the application supported by affidavit praying for permission to file the suit before the expiry of one year from the date of marriage. The application is in accordance with the provisions in the proviso of the Hindu Marriage Act (Calcutta High Court Rules, 1957). It appears to me that this is a case of exceptional on the petitioner and as such the prayer for filing the suit before the expiry of the one year from the date of marriage is allowed."" 7. From the abovequoted order dated 30.11.1991 it does not appear that while disposing of the application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court had regard to the question whether there was a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage. However, it appears from the records that lateron attempts were made for reconciliation but proved futile. Admittedly the husband filed a petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground that the wife has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the husband with cruelty. 8. On 21.12.1992 the following issues were framed by the Trial Court : (1) Is the suit maintainable in its present form and in law ? (2) Is the respondent guilty of cruel conduct towards the petitioner ? (3) Did the respondent desert the company of the petitioner without any lawful excuse ? (4) Is the suit barred by Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act ? (5) What relief, if any, is the petitioner entitled to ? 9. As ground for divorce the term 'cruelty' consists of unwarranted and unjustifiable conduct on part of defendant causing other spouse to endure suffering and distress, thereby destroying peace of mind and making living with such spouse unbearable, completely destroying real purpose and object of matrimony. The term includes mental injury as well as physical. Generally, single act of cruelty is not sufficient for divorce there must be course of cruel conduct over period of time.

He did not take care of the petitioner and her minor child and even the basic amenities were not provided by him. The petitioner suffered physical and mental cruelty at the hands of the respondent. (ii) The petitioners father, a Government servant retired on 31.01.2001 and the respondent with an ulterior motive of extracting the retirement benefits, lured him to come and stay at Coimbatore. The respondent borrowed a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- from the petitioners father. The respondent sold a house to the petitioners father for a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and he promised to pay the balance amount of Rs.3,50,000/- to him with interest. But, the respondent failed to pay the said amount and started harassing the petitioner cruelly and said that the balance amount should be adjusted towards dowry. The petitioner also suffered harassment at the hands of the respondents parents and his sister. Due to ill-treatment and demand of dowry, the petitioner was constrained to prefer a police complaint before All Women Police Station, Coimbatore. (iii) The respondent appeared for an enquiry, admitted the atrocities and cruelty caused to the petitioner and promised to settle the matter amicably. The jewels of the petitioner was received by the respondent and pledged in a bank. The petitioner and her minor daughter were living in Coimbatore with the meagre pension received by her father, who retired as a Tahsildar. Since the respondent was totally negligent to the petitioner and her minor daughter and failed to provide even the basic amenities to them, though he was earning more than Rs.25,000/- per month, the petitioner was constrained to file M.C.No.3 of 2005 before the Family Court, Coimbatore, claiming maintenance of Rs.5000/- per month, each. In the maintenance petition, the respondent has entered appearance and had filed the counter affidavit. As a counter blast to the petitioners complaint, the respondent filed a petition for divorce in H.M.O.P.No.588 of 2004 before the Family Court, Coimbatore. The petitioner has entered appearance and is contesting the petition. (iV) The petitioners mother expired on 15.02.2006 and within a short span of time, her father also expired on 20.02.2006 due to heart-attack. The respondent was residing very close to the house of the petitioner and she was under constant threat by him. After the death of her parents, since she had no relatives at Coimbatore, she came to live in her Uncles house at Tuticorin and since then, the petitioner and her daughter are under the care and custody of her Uncle. The petitioner has no means of livelihood and is unable to maintain herself and her child, aged about four years and her brother, who has just completed his Diploma in Engineering is still unemployed. Whereas, the respondent is earning more than Rs.25,000/- per month. 3. Explaining her financial constraint, difficulty in attending the Court at Coimbatore without the assistance of a male member, the long distance travel of about 500 kms between the place of boarding and the Court, in which the matrimonial disputes are pending and the constant threat faced by her at the hands of the respondent, the petitioner has preferred the above Transfer Petitions.Usha @ Ramalakshmi : vs P.Shanmugam : on 30 August, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1553350/ 24. The respondent has filed a common counter affidavit in both the transfer petitions, contending inter alia and denied all the averments made in the transfer petitions. According to him, the marriage was solemnized at Tirunelveli and a daughter was born to them on 20.05.2002 and the petitioner was always rude and in the habit of harassing him. The respondent, unable to bear the humiliation caused by her was constrained to institute the proceedings in H.M.O.P.No.588 of 2004 before the Family Court, Coimbatore. 5. The respondent has further contended that after the institution of the petition for divorce, as a counter-blast, the petitioner has chosen to initiate maintenance proceedings in M.C.No.3 of 2005, before the Family Court, Coimbatore. In H.M.O.P.No.588 of 2004, counter has been filed, issues have been framed and trial had already commenced. The chief examination of the respondent was over. The respondent has filed proof affidavit on 05.10.2005 and at the instance of the petitioner, the matter has been adjourned for cross-examination and the case was posted for hearing on 03.05.2006. The petitioner has chosen to file Transfer Petitions before this Court on vexatious grounds. The respondent has further contended that because of the conduct of the petitioner, the respondents father committed suicide on 09.08.2004. The petition for divorce has almost reached the stage of final hearing and only to protract the proceedings, the petitioner has come forward with the above transfer petitions. The respondent has also denied the financial incapacity pleaded by the petitioner and alleged suppression of material facts. The respondent contended that the averments made in H.M.O.P. 588/2004 may be read as part and parcel of his counter affidavit and prayed for dismissal of both the Transfer C.M.Ps. 6. Learned Counsel for petitioners has submitted the following grounds for transfer of the proceedings : (i) There is a constant threat by the respondent in Coimbatore, where the proceedings have been instituted, which forced the petitioner to shift her residence from Coimbatore to Tuticorin, where she has taken shelter in her Uncles residence. (ii) The distance between Tuticorin and Coimbatore is about 500 kms. Since her daughter is of tender age and there is no male member to accompany her to Coimbatore on every hearing date, it is impossible for her to go to Coimbatore to defend her case and also to prosecute for maintenance. (iii) She has no means of livelihood for herself and her child and therefore she has filed the maintenance petition before the Family Court, Coimbatore. Her brother is also unemployed. (iv) She has no relatives at Coimbatore and it would be impossible for her to stay alone with her daughter, who is just four years old. The expenses towards boarding and travelling for attending the Court at Coimbatore on each occasion will be around Rs.1000/-. For the grounds stated supra, the petitioner has prayed for transfer of both the proceedings to a competent court at Tuticorin.Usha @ Ramalakshmi : vs P.Shanmugam : on 30 August, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1553350/ 3",['18']

This question arose for consideration in various petitions and we posted all such cases together for hearing. Sri. G. Shrikumar, Advocate, has rendered assistance as amicus curiae for the court. We have had the advantage of hearing Advocates M/s S. Subash Chand, , Sandhya Raju, M.R. Rajesh, R. Sunilkumar, Shoby K. Francis and others on the question. We are answering that question in this case. The finding on that question in this case will be followed in all other cases. 3. Sec.13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, Sec.10A of the Divorce Act and Sec.28 of the Special Marriage Act are all identically worded except in so far as it relates to the stipulation of a larger period of separate residence under Sec.10A of the Divorce Act. That distinction is of no consequence in so far as the question to be considered in this case, raised above, is concerned. 4. The concept of marriage being solemn, sacrosanct and indissoluble is deeply rooted in the Hindu and Christian thoughts and way of life. The concept of divorce was itself accepted and recognized in these systems of personal laws after a long period which witnessed slow evolution of the law. Divorces on the ground of contumacious fault of the spouses and on the ground of absence of unavoidable requirements/essentials for a healthy married life were recognized by law initially. But the voluntary dissolution of marriage at the option of the spouses was not accepted as a concept for a long period of time in many systems of personal laws. With the progressive development of the society and in its march towards modernism, marriage was looked upon more as a social institution entered into by the spouses voluntarily as an incident of the right to life and pursuit of happiness. The institution of marriage started to be reckoned and perceived as one of complementarity partnership, friendship, association, love, affection, caring and sharing etc. With that, the concept of marriage as an institution made in heaven over which spouses have no control started waning. With that came the further thought and idea of terminating the relationship of marriage by the spouses voluntarily by mutual consent. Many a battle had to be fought to get the altered concepts accepted by the society. The change/transformation of mind set was not ushered in one fine morning or with ease. At long last we find individuals, community, society at large, public opinion and legislators yielding to such a concept of marriage and its dissolution and slowly accepting the idea of divorce by mutual consent. Secular personal law as also the different personal laws were constrained to swim with the times and accept the concept of divorce by mutual consent on joint application of the spouses. 5. We shall extract the provisions of Sec.13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, Sec.10A of the Divorce Act and Sec.28 of the Special Marriage Act for easy reference. They read as follows: ""13.B of the Hindu Marriage Act. Divorce by mutual consent.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the district court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage was solemnised before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976), on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one yearM.Krishna Preetha vs Dr.Jayan Moorkkanatt on 22 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76014/ 2or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved.

The marriage was solemnised as per the Hindu Rites and Custom on 29.08.1999 at Ananda Kalyana Mandapam, Chrompet, Chennai. The marriage was an arranged marriage between the parties. Prior to the marriage between the appellant and the respondent, the marriage between the appellant's brother and the respondent's sister was also solemnised on 24.05.1999. After the marriage the appellant became pregnant andS.Valli vs N.Rajendran on 12 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/362760/ 1went to her parents home. ii.Thereafter a male child was born between the parties on 29.08.2000. Alleging that the appellant has left the matrimonial home on her own will and thereafter refused to come back from her parental home, the respondent filed the petition for divorce under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriages Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty which was caused by the desertion of the appellant in view of her objections about the presence of her sister-in-law in her matrimonial home. iii.It is the case of the respondent who was the petitioner in O.P.No.326 of 2001 which was filed for divorce on the ground of mental cruelty that the appellant had a disliking for the respondent's sister. It is further stated that the appellant was instrumental for the problems of the petitioner's sister. The appellant used to go to her parents house situated in the same city even without informing the respondent. When the respondent questioned the appellant she used to threaten him stating that she would commit suicide and implicate him and his parents. iv.It is further stated that on 03.01.2000 the respondent's sister came to his house, since she was ill-treated by the brother of the appellant and her family. On 18.01.2000, the appellant picked up a quarrel with the respondent and took her belongings with her. Thereafter she did not visit the matrimonial home and she was eight weeks pregnant at that point of time. A male child was born on 29.08.2000. The respondent visited the appellant at the hospital but he was not treated well. Neither the appellant nor his family members were invited for the ceremonies conducted on the first year of the child. The above said actions of the appellant would amount to mental cruelty and hence he has filed the petition for divorce. v.A counter affidavit and written submissions were filed on behalf of the appellant stating that she never left her matrimonial home on her own but she was brought to her parents house by her father-in-law for delivering the child. It is not true to state that she created trouble for sister-in-law and if that is the case she would not have married the respondent. Therefore there was no misunderstanding between them. The present petition was filed in view of the petition filed by the sister of the respondent in O.P.No.337 of 2001. She never went to her parents home on her own accord and she only went to the said home on 13.09.1999 during Vinayagar Chathurthi, on 25.09.1999 with her father-in-law to see her sister-in-law, on 03.10.1999 with her husband while she was pregnant for taking rest and 06.11.1999 for Deepavali festival. In fact during the absence of the respondent his mother once locked the door and refused to allow her inside. The issue was kept quite at the request of the respondent. The appellant has never quarrelled with the respondent. The respondent has never visited the appellant and the child after child birth. vi.It is further stated that only on 19.01.2000 she went to her parents home, since she was suffering from morning sickness to take care of her health. Only on her in-laws she was taken to her parents home by her brother with consent. She never picked up any quarrel on 19.01.2000 and took her belongings. It is nothing but natural for a lady suffering from morning sickness due to the early stage of pregnancy to go to her parents home situated in the same city for taking rest. The appellant was not at all responsible for the problems faced by the respondent's sister and the appellant's brother. She never threatened to commit any suicide as alleged in the petition.S.Valli vs N.Rajendran on 12 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/362760/ 2vii.In the written arguments it has been stated that the appellant has always been ready and willing to join and live with the respondent. The petition for divorce has been filed in view of the strained relationship between the sister-in-law and the brother of the appellant. It is the respondent who has refused to take the appellant and the appellant has been waiting for the respondent to take her back into the matrimonial home with the male child. It was also prayed that inasmuch as the appellant is always ready and willing suitable orders will be passed directing the respondent to take her back into the matrimonial home. viii.Before the Trial Court the respondent has examined himself as PW-1 and the appellant has examined herself as RW-1. Two documents have been marked in Ex.A-1 to A-2 by the respondent. Ex.A-1 is the Marriage Invitation dated 29.08.1999 and Ex.A-2 is the Joint Account standing in the name of the parties in the Indian Bank Branch. The Court below after the consideration of the materials available on record has granted a decree for divorce by holding that mental cruelty caused by the appellant has been proved as against the respondent. Challenging the said judgment and decree of the Court below, the appellant has filed the present appeal. 3.PW-1 who is the respondent herein in his evidence has stated that there has been a problem between his sister and brother-in-law and there is a talk of settlement between the parties. In view of the said dispute his sister came to his house and stayed with him which was objected to by the appellant as a result of the same she went to her parental home on her own and she also made a threat to commit suicide. His sister came to his house on 03.01.2000 and on 18.01.2000 the appellant left the matrimonial home on the ground of health. She was eight weeks pregnant at that point of time and child was born on 29.08.2000 which was not informed. The respondent went to see the child on his own and thereafter he was not allowed to see the child and therefore he did not go to see her. From 18.01.2000 the respondent has not joined the appellant. Since the respondent threatened the appellant by stating that she would commit suicide, refused to see the child and also living separately from 18.01.2000 a decree for divorce is to be granted on the ground of mental cruelty. 4.In his cross-examination he has stated that the appellant left on 18.01.2000 after quarrelling with him in view of the presence of his sister. It is further stated that he saw the appellant after the child birth only once and he did not ask the appellant to live with him. When his father and others asked the appellant to live with him but she refused. It was also denied that the petition was filed in view of the fact that his sister and brother-in-law are living separately. 5.RW-1 in her evidence has stated that she has used to go to her parental home along with the respondent. She has further stated that even now she wants to live with the respondent. In her cross-examination she denied that there was any strained relationship between herself and her sister-in-law after the marriage of her brother. 6.It is further stated that the respondent visited the appellant during her pregnancy at her parents home. The birth of the child was informed to the respondent by her father over phone, the appellant used to talk to the respondent very often over phone. There was no celebration of the first birthday of the child, since the parties have been living separately.

Veena Panda alias Seema Panda has preferred two first appeals (1) First Appeal No. 88 of 2005 Under Section 19 Family Court read with Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, against the order dated 16.09.2005 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Lucknow in Misc. Case No. 38-C/2004 under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act connected with Suit No. 196 of 2004 (Smt. Veena Panda v. Devendra Kishore Panda) under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights and (2) First Appeal No. 87 of 2005 against the same common order dated 16.09.2005 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Lucknow in Misc. Case No. 189-C/2004 under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act connected with Regular Suit No. 407 of 2004 Devendra Kishore Panda v. Smt. Veena Panda, under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, for judicial separation. Both the appeals between the same parties dealing with pendente lite maintenance and litigation expenses are being taken up together for convenience. 2. The facts, wrapped in brevity, are that on 11.02.2004 the appellant, Smt. Veena Panda (wife) filed a case (Suit No. 196 of 2004) under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights against her husband, Sri Devendra Kishore Panda (respondent) and also moved an application on 11.02.2004 for pendentelite maintenance and litigation expenses under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking Rs. 15,000/- per month as maintenance and Rs. 11,000/- for litigation expenses. On the other hand the respondent-husband, Sri Devendra Kishore Panda, filed a case (Suit No. 407 of 2004) on 02.04.2004 against his wife (appellant) under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act for judicial separation. In this case also the wife (appellant) filed similar application on 16.07.2004 for pendente lite maintenance and litigation expenses of similar amount. Both these applications for pendente lite maintenance and litigation expenses were decided by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Lucknow by passing the single impugned order dated 16.09.2005 rejecting the prayer for pendente lite maintenance while allowing Rs. 2500/-each as litigation expenses in respect of both the cases. Feeling aggrieved by this order the aforesaid first appeals have been preferred by Smt. Veena Panda against her husband, Devendra Kishore Panda. 3. After hearing both the parties the learned Principal Judge, Family Court found that Smt. Veena Panda was admittedly living with her husband [an IPS Officer now voluntarily retired w.e.f. 28.11.2005] in official residence No. 5/2 Senior Police Officers Colony, Vibhuti Khan, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. 4. The following details of salary as on January, 2005 were furnished by Sri D.K.Panda himself in the lower court during the course of arguments, which are also acceptable to Smt. Veena Panda as per paragraph 4 of her affidavit dated 15.02.2005 filed in lower court:       (1) Basic pay           :     22400        (2) DA                  :     13511        (3) CCA                 :       150 Smt. Veena Panda vs Devendra Kishore Panda on 22 February, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1616696/ 1      (4) Other allowances    :       375                          ------------------                         TOTAL :     37544/                         ------------------    The learned Judge Family court worked out permissible deductions as under:           (1) GPF         : 2500        (2) G.I.S.      :  120       (3) H.Rent      :  600       (4) Use of car  :  500         (5) Income Tax  : 7500 (In proportion of income tax payable on the total income) Thus total carry home salary as on January, 2005 was worked out to be Rs. 37544.00 - 11220.00 = 26324.00 per month. 5. But he found that the wife was not entitled for any pendente lite maintenance because admittedly she has been living in the aforesaid house with her husband and her all the basic needs are being fulfilled. She was not dependent on anybody for her basic needs. Therefore, the prayer for pendente lite maintenance was rejected. However, keeping in view the monthly income of the husband the learned Judge awarded litigation expenses of Rs. 2500/- each in both the cases pending between the parties. 6. Heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record. After the arguments of the learned Counsel for both the parties were concluded on 23.01.2006 the respondent, Sri Devendra Kishore Panda, made a request for hearing him in person. He was permitted to argue in person but his arguments remained incomplete and for that purpose 7th February, 2006 was fixed. On 7th February, 2006 the respondent did not appear and the case was adjourned to 14.02.2006. On 14.02.2006 the case was got adjourned and 21.02.2006 was fixed. On 21.02.2006 respondent again did not appear in person and therefore a last opportunity was given to him fixing 22.02.2006 making it clear that if the respondent desires to argue in person he may do so on 22.02.2006 and the case will not be adjourned on any ground. The respondent did not avail the last opportunity extended to him to hear in person although the arguments of his counsel had already been concluded, and on 22.02.2006 the respondent again did not appear. In these circumstances judgment was reserved. 7. The following case laws have been relied upon by the learned Counsel for appellant: I. Baby Rashmi Mehra v. Sunil Mehra . In this case it was held that no rigid formula about percentage of income can be fixed for giving maintenance. The quantum depends upon the status and income of the parties. The leading case of privy council, Ekradeshwari v. Homeshwar reported in AIR 1929 privy council 128 was also referred to in this case wherein it was observed thatSmt.

Our Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kulbhushan v. Raj Kumari expressed its agreement with the aforesaid observation of the privy council. In this case it was also observed by the single Judge of Delhi High Court that in one case the maintenance may be 25% while in another it may be 50% or even less or more. The quantum depends upon the position of status of the parties including financial position of the defendant and the reasonable demands of the claimant or any other factor. There can be no quarrel with the principle laid down in these cases. II. Dev Dutt Singh v. Rajani Gandhi 1984 (1) DMC Delhi 212. In this case it was held that if the husband is living in his own house the wife is also entitled to accommodation in the same house or in a separate building. There can be no dispute in respect of this principle also. III. Dinesh Giju Bhai Mehta v. Smt Usha Dinesh Mehta 1979-M L R 209 Bombay- (DB). In this case the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that rule 1/5 of net income of husband is unreasonable because wife and husband are equally partners. IV. Kalaben Kalabhai Desai v.

Rule. Since the respondent did not appear after service and publication, the matter has already been proceeded ex parte against the respondent. 2.This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenges the order dated 31.3.2004 passed by Additional District Judge who declined to modify and rectify the order dated 1.10.2003 and for passing decree of divorce under Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act'). 3. In a troubled marriage there were pending criminal matters and divorce proceedings. Eventually divorce by mutual consent and settlement of all criminal and civil disputes was agreed to by both the spouses resulting inter alia in the wife withdrawing her criminal complaints and dropping all claims towards maintenance for herself and her daughter. The husband enjoyed all the benefits of the settlement and then remarried and has a child from the second marriage and yet withdrew his consent for divorce by mutual consent leading to the situation where by the impugned judgment the learned Additional District Judge has declined to grant divorce to the petitioner/wife by permitting the unilateral withdrawal of mutual consent by the respondent/husband leading to the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. 4. The facts of the case as per the unrebutted averments in the writ petition are as under: a) The marriage between the petitioner/wife and the respondent/husband who are both Hindus, was solemnized on 12.3.1996 according to Hindu Rites and ceremonies. b) That on 11.12.1997 one female child was born and the said child is in the custody of the petitioner. c) After the marriage the petitioner was subjected to cruelty and humiliation by the respondent and was the victim of harassment caused by respondent for continuous demand of dowry, by beating and torturing the petitioner at the instigation of his parents with desire to fulfilll the demand of dowry and cash which led to continuous mental tension, cruelty and agony to the petitioner. Under compulsion and torturous circumstances the parents of the petitioner paid lot of money to the respondent on demand ad also arranged separate accommodation so that the matrimonial life of the petitioner may not get disturbed. d) That because of violent behavior and greedy nature of the respondent, the petitioner was thrown out by the respondent from the matrimonial home. It is not in dispute that since 7th Feb.2002 both the parties are living separately.Smt. Rachna Jain vs Shri Neeraj Jain on 25 May, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1308307/ 1e) That on 18.2.2002 the respondent/husband filed a petition under section 10 of the 'Act' for judicial separation before the District Judge, Delhi and on 1.5.2002 petitioner filed a complaint under section 498A/406 IPC before Dowry Cell. f) On 15.7.2002 the petitioner filed an application under Section 24 of the Act for maintenance before the Additional District Judge, Delhi after she put in her appearance on the receipt of summons in the above matter. g) That on 16.9.2002, the respondent moved an application before the Ld. ADJ for withdrawal of his petition under Section 10 which was declined by the said court. h) That on 8.9.2003 both the parties compromised their disputes and entered into a compromise deed. By virtue of the settlement under the said compromise the parties filed an application under Order 6 Rule 17 read with section 151 CPC for amendment converting the petition under Section 10 of Hindu Marriage Act into a petition under Section 13(B)(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce by mutual consent. i) Along with the application for amendment both the parties filed their affidavit in support as well as both the petitions under section 13B(1) and 13B(2) of the said Act for dissolution of their marriage by way of mutual consent together with the compromise deed and prayed for waiving the stipulated period of 6 months and permission to place on record the petition under section 13B(2) along with the petition under Section 13B(1) of the said Act which is admitted by both the parties as per the records of the trial Court. j) That on 25.9.2003 the learned ADJ allowed the above application for amendment and recorded the joint statements of both the parties knowing well that both the petitions under section 13B(1) and 13B(2) of the Act were on record. The said statement is as follows:- ""The marriage between both the parties was solemnized according to Hindu rites and ceremonies on 12.3.1996 at Delhi. After marriage, both the parties lived together as husband and wife and cohabited with each other and one female child, named Larika Jain was born out of the said wedlock. Due to differences in our attitudes and temperaments, we both are living separately since 7.2.2002 and now there is no possibility of our living together as husband and wife. We have amicably settled all our disputes with regard to dowry articles, maintenance and permanent alimony and Istridhan etc. as per the compromise Deed, which is annexed with the petition and is Exb.P.1.

Rachna Jain vs Shri Neeraj Jain on 25 May, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1308307/ 2k) On 1.10.2003 the learned Additional District Judge passed the following order;- ""From the statement of the petitioners it is also evident that the consent of the petitioners for divorce is free from force, fraud or undue influence and there is no collusion in filing this petition. I am therefore satisfied that the requirements of section 13(B)(1) of the Act have been duly satisfied in this case. However, the marriage of the petitioners can not be dissolved straight away in view of the provisions of section 13(B)(2) of the H.M. Act. Both the petitioners are therefore advised to try to live together and to patch-up their differences in due course of time. In case, they fail to do so, they may move their second motion petition within the statutory period in accordance with law."" l) That on 9.10.2003 the petitioner moved an application under Section 151 CPC for modification of the above order dated 1.10.2003 and submitted that on 25.9.2003 both the petitions under section 13B(1) and 13B(2) of the Act were on record and the parties have compromised their disputes and given their consent for dissolving the marriage by way of decree of divorce by mutual consent. It was also admitted by both the parties that the Learned Additional District Judge granted permission to file the second motion petition under Section 13B(2) of the Act by waiving the stipulated period of 6 months on the oral request and prayer of the parties. Therefore, it was prayed that the order dated 1.10.2003 passed by the said Court be rectified/modified to the extent that the marriage between the parties stands dissolved after the joint statement was recorded on 25.9.2003. m) That on 19.1.2004 the respondent filed an application for withdrawal of his consent in a second motion and admitted in the said application that the Learned Additional District Judge was pleased to grant permission to file the second motion then by waiving the stipulated period of 6 months. The only ground mentioned for withdrawal of the consent was that the respondent after signing the second motion has realized his approach on matrimonial matter is not correct and further felt that the matrimonial relationship must continue. 5. That on 31.3.2004 the Learned Additional District Judge dismissed the application of the petitioner for modification of the order dated 1.10.2003 and allowed the application of the respondent for withdrawal of the consent in the second motion under Section 13B(2) and dismissed the said petition. This petition challenges the order dated 31.3.04 permitting the respondent to withdraw his counsel. 6. That the impugned order dated 31.3.2004 declining to modify the order dated 1.10.2003 thereby dismissing the petition under section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows; "" Before adverting to the submissions made by the Ld.

CMA No. 1082 of 1996 arises out of an order passed by the Court of Subordinate Judge, Kavali in OP No.2 of 1988 filed by the husband under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and CMA No.1257 of 1996 arises out of an order passed by the same Court in OP No.85 of 1988 filed by the wife under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for restitution of conjugal rights. The learned Subordinate Judge, Kavali allowed OP No.2 of 1988 filed by the husband and granted a decree of divorce between the parties and dismissed OP No.85 of 1988 filed by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights, by a common order dated 28-9-1995. The wife has filed these two appeals aggrieved by the common order passed by the Court below in the two respective OPs. 2. For the sake of convenience, the parties are addressed to as the wife and husband. 3. The appellant-wife and respondent-husband are doctors by profession. Their marriage took place on 19-3-1981 at Secunderabad as per custom and usage. The wife joined the society of the husband eight months after the marriage. Initially, both of them lived together at Kavali for about four months. Thereafter, the husband secured a job at Vijayawada and he worked there for a period of one year. 4. Before the Court below, the case of the husband in OP No.2 of 1988 is that during his stay at Vijayawada, the wife hardly stayed with him for a month and she stayed more in Kavali and was visiting Viajaywada now and then. During her brief visits to Viajaywada, she used to pick up quarrels with the husband without any cause and used to expose the family affairs to public. According to the husband, the wife never intended to keep up the prestige of the family. She often used to scold the petitioner and his family members without any justification. She used to create scenes by removing the mangalasutra and cause lot of mental agony and suffering to the husband. 5. After his serving period of one year at Vijayawada, the husband was appointed as Government Doctor and posted to Pedapariya of Gudur Taluk of Nellore District and he worked there for about a year and half. It is alleged by the husband, the wife used to visit his place occasionally but failed to give him the conjugal happiness. She was bent upon creating nuisance during her visit. According to the husband, he was transferred to Hyderabad after serving about a year and half at Pedapariya. By that time, the wife completed her DGO which she discontinued by the date of her marriage. 6. According to the husband, he put up his family at Hyderabad with his wife. A daughter is also born to them at Hyderabad. Even at Hyderabad, the wife was behaving indecently by scolding the husband. Due to the cruel conduct of the wife, since he has no option, the husband cultivated the habit of adjusting with the wife. Despite his tolerance, the attitude of the wife was such that it became impossible for the husband to adjust with her.Dr. Lokeshwari vs Dr. Srinivasa Rao on 11 February, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10471794/ 17. After working about one year and eight months at Hyderabad, the husband seems to have secured a job in Iran. He came to his native place Kavali along with the wife and daughter and lived there for one month. During that period, the wife never treated him as her husband and did not behave with him properly. The husband requested the wife to treat him as her husband and behave properly. However, she did not care for his advice. The husband before leaving for Iran, requested the wife to stay at Kavali till he sends communication to her to go over to Iran after getting visa and other transport facilities ready. 8. According to the husband, after one and half years he returned from Iran to Kavali and requested the wife to come along with the child to Iran. However, the wife in her usual arrogant way refused to follow his words. The husband alleges that the wife has been habitually guilty of causing mental agony and treated him with cruelty. The attitude of the wife was also harsh towards the child and she used to beat and ill-treat the child for no reasons. The husband made efforts to see that the wife joins his society and advised her to mend her ways. But all his efforts proved futile. According to the husband, the wife left his society in the month of October, 1987 and went to Hyderabad along with the daughter without any reason and did not return to his fold. The husband, as a last resort and with a view to give the wife an opportunity to come and live with him, issued a notice calling upon the wife to come and live with him. But the notice was returned by her with false endorsements. 9. The husband on one occasion with a view to bring about a change in the attitude of the wife, took her and the child to the house of his friend Dr. Venkateswara Rao at Siddipet. But the wife did not change her attitude and there also as usual she wept and created scenes and tortured the husband. She also made attempts to interfere with the professional functions of Dr. Venkateswara Rao who advised the husband to take back the wife to her parents house. While coming to Hyderabad from Siddipet, the wife stopped the car and got down with the child near Sanjai theatre and threw the child on the traffic road and behaved in such a manner that huge mob gathered there. The husband somehow maintained his cool, persuaded the wife and brought her to Hyderabad. According to the husband, the wife instead of going to their house, went to her aunt's house and there also she abused the husband in filthy language. The husband suffered mental agony due to the attitude of the wife. According to the husband, the series of incidents right from the year 1982 onwards showed that the wife is bent upon creating problems and insulting him and her attitude was always to pick up quarrels with him. The husband also averred that one day he took his wife to Hotel Siddartha at Hyderabad to bring about a change in her attitude. According to him, she picked up quarrel with him even at the Hotel and threw chappals on him. The husband stated that all these acts of omissions and commissions by the wife are such that he is unable to bear them as they are tortuous and created mental agony to him. 10. The husband also complained that the wife gave a false complaint to the police as if he is harassing her. After preliminary enquiry, the police found the allegations made against him to be false. According to the husband, the father of the wife was encouraging her and was behind her but did not prevent and advise her to change her attitude. Under these circumstances, the husband pleaded that it is impossible for him to continue to lead the marital life with the wife and under such circumstances he presented OP No.2 of 1988 seeking dissolution of his marriage with the wife under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.Dr. Lokeshwari vs Dr. Srinivasa Rao on 11 February, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10471794/ 211. The wife filed a detailed counter to the OP No.2 of 1988 denying the allegations levelled against her by the husband. The wife denied that the husband has taken her along with the child to his friend Dr. Venkateswara Rao's house at Siddipet. She further stated that the said story is invented only for the purpose of getting rid of her. According to the wife, though their marriage took place in the year 1981, her parents could not give money to the husband and therefore, he started ill-treating her and created all sorts of trouble so that she would get money to quench the thirst of the husband. The wife has also denied the allegation that she was taken to Hotel Siddartha at Hyderabad where she is alleged to have created a scene and threw chappals at him. According to her, she stayed in the house of the husband at Kavali in the upstairs portion. She was constrained to vacate that portion as the other family members of the husband had created problems to her even by filing a case against her and obtained an interim injunction against her for vacating the house. According to her, the husband has not allowed her to stay along with joint family members nor he has allowed her to set up private practice. The respondent denied that she has no intention to live with the husband. She further alleged that the husband is accustomed to lead an immoral life and prayed for dismissal of the OP filed by the husband. 12. The wife also filed OP No.85 of 1988 against the husband under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for restitution of conjugal rights. In her petition, the wife averred that after the marriage she immediately joined the husband. At the time of marriage, she was doing post-graduation in Gynaecology and Obsteritrics. According to her, she continued her study of post-graduation for about one year subsequent to her marriage and the husband was staying at Secunderabad and has been applying for jobs. She stated that after one year, he secured a job in St. Ann's Hospital, Vijayawada as a Civil Assistant Surgeon and he worked there for a period of one and half years. At that time, she claims to have stayed in the parents house of the husband. The husband was occasionally visiting her. After the husband was selected as Civil Assistant Surgeon he was posted as Assistant Surgeon in Pedapariya, Gudur taluk of Nellore District and later he was transferred to Hyderabad by which time she completed her post-graduation and obtained DGO. According to her, the husband took a house in Red Hills area and they stayed in that house for a period of one and half years. During that period, her husband got a job in Iran as Civil Assistant Surgeon and he left for Iran after obtaining leave and stayed in Iran for about one and half years. She stated that though she advised the husband not to seek a job in Iran as there was a civil war at that time between Iran and Iraq, he refused to budge and on the contrary desired the wife to join his society at Iran. On this issue, some misunderstandings cropped up between them which has reached a point of no return. According to the wife, the husband has no justifying reasons to keep her away from his society and therefore, prayed the Court below to pass a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. 13. The husband who filed OP No.2 of 1988 for dissolution of his marriage with the wife, filed a detailed counter in OP No.85 of 1988 reiterating the same stand taken by him OP No.2 of 1988. 14. The Court below decided to dispose of these two OPs., by a common order and on a memo filed by both parties, the two OPs., were clubbed together and evidence was recorded in OP No.2 of 1988. 15. On behalf of the husband, PWs.1 to 3 were examined and Exs.A1 to A7 were marked. The husband himself examined as PW1, and examined his friend one Dr. Venkateswara Rao as PW2Dr. Lokeshwari vs Dr. Srinivasa Rao on 11 February, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10471794/ 3","['9', '13']"

The respondent-husband 2 of 23 3 cam.448.14.doc has preferred Family Court Appeal No. 142 of 2014 challenging the common judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed by the learned Judge of the Family Court No.4, Mumbai whereby the wife's Petition No. A-849 of 2011 for divorce on the ground of cruelty came to be allowed. It is seen that the record clearly shows that certified copy of the order was applied on 13.12.2013, it was ready on 6.1.2014 and it was delivered on the next day i.e. on 7.1.2014. Family Court Appeal No. 142 of 2014 was filed on 7.2.2014. Thus, it is seen that the Family Court Appeal was filed after 30 days but within 90 days. 3 The applicant-wife has preferred present Civil Application No. 448 of 2014 in Family Court Appeal No. 142 of 2014 raising the ground that as the Family Court Appeal No. 142 of 2014 was not filed within 30 days as provided under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, the Family Court Appeal is barred by law of limitation and the same be rejected.Mrs. Sonia Kunwar Singh Bedi vs Mr. Kunwar Singh Bedi on 17 December, 2014 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18447137/ 24 Mr. Jaisinghani, the learned counsel for the applicant has placed reliance on the following decisions to support his 3 of 23 4 cam.448.14.doc claim that the period of limitation is 30 days as contemplated under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act of 1984 and not 90 days as contemplated under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.

This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 1645 of 1997 was field under Section 384 of Indian Succession Act, 1925 read with Order 41, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the judgment and decree in AS No.29 of 1992 dated 26th February, 1997 on the file of the II Addl. Dist. Judge, Cuddapah, aggrieved by the finding that the first appellant is the wife of late Subba Rachaiah, and the appellants 2 to 4, children born to them are illegitimate children, are not entitled to succeed to the intestate properties of Subba Rachaiah inasmuch as the appellants 2 to 4 are the illegitimate children of late Subba Rachaiah and the second respondent herein is the wife of late Subba Rachaiah and the respondents 1, 3 and 4 are the legitimate children of late Subba Rachaiah and they are entitled to issue succession certificate to succeed to the petition schedule securities and accordingly dismissed the appeal confirming the order and decree dated 13-4-1992 in OP No. 16 of 1991 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Rayachoty. 2. The appellants have assailed the correctness and legality of the findings of the Courts below on the ground that having held that the first appellant is the wife of Subba Rachaiah has erred in holding that the appellants are not entitled to succeed to his intestate property and confirmed the finding of the trial Court that the appellants 2 to 4, being illegitimate children, are not entitled to succeed to the property, that the Courts below have erred in holding that the appellants 2 to 4 are not the legitimate children of late Subba Rachaiah; it is further contended that as per Ex.B-1 to B-41, late Subba Rachaiah was the lawful husband of the first appellant and the appellants 2 to 4 are the legitimate children of late Subba Rachaiah, that the Court below has failed to notice that in Service Register the first appellant, after her marriage got changed her surname from 'Matchi' to 'Gannamanthi' after her husband's name and the same was notified in the Gazette dated 24-12-1964, therefore, the Courts below should have held that the appellants 2 to 4 are entitled for grant of succession certificate. It is also contended that in many title deeds, the first' appellant has been described as the wife of late Subba Rachaiah and in Ration Card, Ex.B30, issued in the name of late Subba Rachaiah, the name of all the appellants find place in it and the finding of the Courts below that the marriage between the first appellant and late Subba Rachaiah took place subsequent to 1955 is also contrary to facts and law, therefore the judgments of the Courts below are liable to be set aside. It is further contended that on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case, the lower Courts should have held that the second respondent is not the legally wedded wife of late Subba Rachaiah, as she failed to prove that her marriage was performed ,as per the Hindu rites and customs, and for all the above mentioned reasons, it is submitted that the order passed by both the Courts below is contrary to facts and law and evidence on record and therefore, liable to be set aside. 3. The facts in nutshell are that OP No.16 of 1991 was filed under Section 372 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 before the Subordinate Judge, Rayachoty, by the petitioners therein to issue succession certificate in their favour, as legal heirs of late Subba Rachaiah in respect of the petition schedule securities and for costs of the petition.G. Nirmalamma And Others vs G. Seethapathi And Others on 19 October, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35281232/ 14. For the sake of convenience, the parties arc referred as they are referred in the OP as petitioners and respondents. It is averred in the petition that late Subba Rachaiah (hereinafter referred to as the deceased), who retired as a Teacher died on 18-12-1987 leaving behind him the petitioners as his legal heirs. The second petitioner is the wife of the deceased and their marriage was celebrated on 30-12-1939 at Cuddapah and it was consummated and the first petitioner is the son and petitioners 3 and 4 are the daughters of deceased. The deceased was a pensioner and after his death the 2nd petitioner applied for family pension and the Mandal Revenue Officer gave an endorsement that she may apply for succession certificate before competent Court of law since there was a counter claim from the first respondent claiming herself to the legally wedded wife of the deceased, that by the date of marriage of the second petitioner with the deceased he had no wife living, that the deceased developed illicit intimacy with the first respondent some where in the year 1957 and out of the said intrigue respondents 2 to 4 were born and since the first respondent is not legally wedded wife, the respondents 2 to 4 are illegitimate children and cannot be the legal heirs of the deceased, that at the time of marriage of the second petitioner the deceased was working as a teacher in District Board Engineering Officer, Cuddapah and his GPF account was opened and the second petitioner was shown as his wife and on 11-4-1968 the deceased gifted some properties in favour of the second petitioner under a registered gift deed, describing her as wife of the deceased, that on 27-4-1985 the deceased executed a settlement deed in favour of his grand son Setish, the son of first petitioner and on the same day the deceased executed separate settlement deed in favour of other grand sons Satish and Girish, who are the sons of the first petitioner, that on 22-9-1977 the deceased executed sale deed in respect of some of the properties in favour of the second petitioner, that the petitioners also filed certificate issued by the respectable citizens of Rayachoty testifying to the effect that they intimately knew the family of the deceased and the second petitioner is his wife. Therefore, they prayed to issue a succession certificate in respect of the petition schedule securities in their favour as legal heirs of the deceased. 5. The respondents filed their counter contending that the deceased died intestate in respect of the petition schedule securities on 18-12-1987 in Government Hospital, Cuddapah, but denied leaving the petitioners as his legal heirs and the wedding card filed along with the petition is a got up one and the other documents are created to make use for documentary evidence and they further stated that if at all there was any intimacy with the second petitioner and the deceased, it was illicit intimacy and taking advantage of the illicit intimacy, the second petitioner obtained fraudulent document in her name and in the name of other petitioners, that the petitioners have to prove that they are legal heirs. It is further stated that the first respondent is the legally wedded wife of the deceased and their marriage was performed on 10-5-1955 in Post Office Street, Rayachoty at her parents house according to Hindu rites and customs, that in 1960 the first respondent was appointed as Staff Nurse and after her appointment she got her surname changed from 'Matli' to 'Gannamanthi' and it was notified in the A.P. Gazette dated 24-12-1964 and the Service Register was also suitably amended. It is further stated that on 6-10-1964 the first respondent purchased Ac.0.12 cents in S.No.30/2 in Akkayapalli Panchayath under a registered sale deed from the mother of the 2nd petitioner's sister's husband, Venkataiah, who also attested the document, in the said document the first respondent's name is mentioned as the wife of the deceased, that the second respondent purchased property under registered sale deed dated 19-5-1970 and in the said document, the name of his father is mentioned as Subba Rachaiah, that the first respondent obtained an assignment deedG.

It is further submitted that there is ample record to show that the deceased has been living with the respondents continuously ever since the marriage till death, that publication made in Andhra Jyothi on 17-12-1987 inviting the kith and kin for the 13th day ceremony of the deceased, contains the names of the respondents and sons-in-law, in the school records of the respondents 2 to 4, their father's name is mentioned as Subba Rachaiah, that none of the petitioners attended funeral and obsequies of the deceased and they did not care the deceased during ailment, that the voters' list discloses that the deceased was living with the first respondent at Rayachoty, that the loan discharge certificate in respect of the loan taken by the deceased from Rayachoty Co-operative Society, is with the first respondent, that in the ration card issued in favour of the deceased, the names of the respondents and their relationship was also mentioned. It is further stated that after the death of the deceased, the second petitioner attempted to obtain legal heir certificate from the Revenue Department without the knowledge of the respondents, which was rejected by the Revenue Officials. It is alleged that the petitioners were aware of their relationship with the deceased and therefore, they kept quiet for all these 34 years, that the first respondent filed a suit OS No. 190 of 1986 on the file of the District Munsif, Rayachoty as legal heirs of the deceased and the suit is pending, that the second respondent deposited SBBL gun with the Police after the death of the deceased, that the properties relating to the deceased are in possession of the respondents and the petitioners have nothing to do with the respondents. 6.

The trial Court having regard to both oral and documentary evidence, came to the conclusion that the 2nd petitioner is the legally wedded wife of the deceased and the petitioners 1, 3 and 4 are his legitimate children and as such held that they are entitled to issue succession certificate in their favour as legal heirs of the deceased in respect of the petition schedule securities, which was confirmed by the learned II Addl. Dist. Judge, Cuddapah, by his judgment dated 26-2-1997 in AS No.29 of 1992 dismissing the appeal, which is assailed in this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal. 8. Now adverting to the question whether the first appellant is the legally wedded wife of the deceased and appellants 2 to 4 are legitimate children born to them, are entitled for the issuance of succession certificate as per the provisions of Hindu Succession Act, 1956. 9. While addressing the arguments that the appellants are entitled to grant the succession certificate under Hindu Succession Act, the learned Counsel for the appellants has relied on a judgment Sharttaram Tukaram Patail and another v. Smt. Dagubai Tukaram Patil and others, , wherein a matter arose under Section 16 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In the above case, Tukaram married Dagubai and she got three children from Tukaram and during the subsistence of marriage, Tukaram married Leelabai in the year 1976 and from her he got a son Shantaram.

The marriage between the appellant-husband, Darshan Gupta and the respondent-wife, Radhika Gupta, was solemnized on 9.5.1997 at the Holiday Inn Hotel in Hyderabad, as per Hindu rights and customs. This was not the first matrimonial alliance between the two families. The husband’s elder brother was already married to the wife’s sister. Both parties admittedly belong to well-to-do families. At the time of marriage between the parties, Darshan Gupta, the husband was 22 years of age, and Radhika Gupta was 19. Now the husband is 35, and the wife 32. The marriage between the parties was duly consummated, and their relationship blossomed into one full of love and affection. 2. The cordiality between the parties continued for a period of two years, till the wife conceived for the first time in February 1999. The aforestated conception was aborted when Radhika Gupta was in the fourth month of her pregnancy, as she had commenced to suffer from hypertension resulting into fits, extreme morning sickness and general weakness. The decision to abort the pregnancy in June, 1999, was based on medical advice. 3. The wife Radhika Gupta conceived for the second time in February 2000. During the instant pregnancy, she had similar symptoms, as she had suffered on the earlier occasion. For the aforesaid reason, and on medical advice, when the pregnancy was in its eighth month, a caesarian operation was performed in September, 2000. At the time of birth of the child, the wife, Radhika Gupta, was unconscious. Even after the child was delivered, she remained unconscious. The child born to Radhika Gupta survived for only eight days.Darshan Gupta vs Radhika Gupta on 1 July, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36001047/ 14. Since Radhika Gupta had developed serious medical complications, she was treated at the best hospitals at Hyderabad, amongst others at the Apollo Hospital, as an indoor patient. Doctors from across the country were consulted. They had attended upon her, at the behest of her husband Darshan Gupta. To ensure that there was no deficiency in her medical upkeep, she was shifted to the Leelavathi Hospital at Mumbai. At Mumbai, further tests were conducted and surgeries were performed. She also sought consultations from the National Institute of Medical Health and Neuroscience, Bangalore (NIMHANS). 5. During the treatment of Radhika Gupta, neurologists and gynecologists looking after her believed, that she had suffered brain damage. On that account, she is stated to have lost her memory, so much so, that she could not even recognize persons of close affinity. Her speech was also stated to have been substantially impaired. It was averred, that the condition of the wife was such, that she could not even discharge her personal obligations. She had to be assisted by an attendant. According to the contention of Darshan Gupta, the condition of Radhika Gupta was no better than a child of five years. He also alleged, that Radhika Gupta’s condition was such, that she could not be left alone in the room, nor could she be permitted to use the bathroom by herself. Gynecologists, who examined Radhika Gupta had opined, that she was not fit for discharging her matrimonial obligations. They also felt, that she could not bear a child. Neurologists believed, that it was impossible for the husband to live with Radhika Gupta. On the subject of their marital relationship, the husband contends, that his wife did not allow him to touch her physically, even to please her. It is the husband’s assertion, that at times Radhika Gupta would wake up in the middle of the night, and thereafter, would not allow him to sleep. Darshan Gupta even accused his wife, for shouting and screaming without any reason. 6. For the upkeep, maintenance and sustenance of his wife, the appellant Darshan Gupta, is stated to have created a trust with a corpus of Rs.10,00,000/-. For his wife’s residence, the appellant Darshan Gupta persuaded his father to execute a lease deed of a flat in a posh locality, at a nominal rent, in favour of the trust. Besides the aforesaid, the appellant Darshan Gupta has been paying his wife Radhika Gupta a sum of Rs.25,000/- per month towards maintenance, during the pendency of the proceedings. 7. In response, the case set up by Radhika Gupta has been, that after her first conception was aborted in June, 1999, the attending gynecologist at Apollo Hospital, had cautioned the couple against any further conception for at least two years. The couple had been advised, that pregnancy of Radhika Gupta during this period could lead to serious medical complications. Despite having been forewarned by the gynecologist, Radhika Gupta alleges, that her husband had proceeded with unsafe cohabitation, resulting in a second pregnancy within a short period of eight months (after the termination of the first pregnancy), i.e., well within the unsafe period. According to Radhika Gupta, true to the advice of the attending gynecologist, the second pregnancy resulted in the same symptoms as she had suffered during her first pregnancy. It was her assertion, that she had again started to suffer from hypertension resulting in fits, extreme morning sickness and general weakness. Despite the precarious condition of the wife, she was persuaded by her husband, Darshan Gupta, to carry on the pregnancy till the eighth month. The wife acknowledges the caesarian operation conducted on 20.9.2000, as also the fact, that the child born to her surviving for onlyDarshan Gupta vs Radhika Gupta on 1 July, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36001047/ 2eight days. In this behalf her assertion is, that her husband was to be blamed for the same, as he did not heed to the medical advice of the gynecologist. According to Radhika Gupta, the fall out of the second pregnancy, specially the effect thereof to her health, was the real cause of the turn around of the matrimonial relationship, between the parties. For that, Radhika Gupta blames her husband. 8. Despite the factual position noticed hereinabove, Radhika Gupta – the wife, claims to be hale and hearty. Before the Family Court, she had expressed, that she was ready and willing for any medical evaluation, at the Court’s behest. According to Radhika Gupta, after the death of the new born, her husband did not extend, the care that she deserved from him. This had happened after the termination of the first pregnancy also. At that juncture, her parents had taken her to neurologists, psychologists and occupational therapists of national repute. After the caesarian surgery, Radhika Gupta had remained unconscious. She used to suffer series of fits. It is therefore, that she had to be shifted to the Apollo Hospital. After treatment, she had regained her consciousness, and had become more oriented. It is the wife’s assertion, that yet again after the episode of the second pregnancy, the husband did not extend any emotional or moral support to her. Rather than taking care of her, she was shifted to her parents’ house in May 2002. It is the wife’s contention, that her parents again took good care of her. They had again sought advice from specialists of different medical fields, as before. The undisputed factual position between the parties is, that ever since she was shifted to her parents house in May 2002, Radhika Gupta has remained at her parents’ house, except for a few days (from 29.9.2011 to 3.10.2011), that also, in compliance with the desire and directions of this Court. 9. It has been, and it still is, the wife’s case, that she is intensely concerned about her future relationship with her husband, and that, her greatest and paramount desire is to rejoin her husband, and to live with him normally in a matrimonial relationship, once again. According to the respondent-wife, all efforts made by her have failed, only on account of the rigid attitude of her husband. 10. On the above facts, OP No.926 of 2002 was filed by the appellant- husband before the Family Court seeking dissolution of marriage under clauses (ia) and (iii) of Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. As against the aforesaid, OP No.629 of 2003 was filed by Radhika Gupta, before the same Court, seeking restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Both the cases were clubbed together. Evidence was recorded in OP No.926 of 2002, and the same was treated as evidence for the determination of OP 629 of 2003 as well. 11. Darshan Gupta examined four witnesses in all. He examined himself as PW1. He examined his maternal aunt Nirmala Devi as PW2. Darpan Gupta, the twin elder brother of the appellant-Darshan Gupta was examined as PW3. Dr. M. Veera Raghava Reddy, a practicing neurologist was examined as PW4. The testimony of the husband Darshan Gupta who appeared before the Family Court as PW1, was in consonance with the factual position indicated in the pleadings, as also, in the factual narration recorded hereinabove. PW2 and PW3 being close family relations supported the statement of Darshan Gupta- PW1, in all material particulars. While deposing before the Family Court, Dr. M. Veera Raghava Reddy-PW4 stated, that he had referred the respondent- wife Radhika Gupta to Dr. Nagaraja for a second opinion.

Majula Debi Banerjee on 11 April, 1988 Equivalent citations: AIR 1989 Cal 80, 92 CWN 1123 Author: A Bhattacharjee Bench: A Bhattacharjee, A K Nayak JUDGMENT A.M. Bhattacharjee, J. 1. An order under Section 24, Hindu Marriage Act for maintenance pendente lite and expenses of the proceeding in a matrimonial proceeding is obviously passed to provide the weaker spouse with such fund as may be reasonably necessary for her or his support and for the carriage of the litigation and such an order automatically comes to an end with the termination of the main proceeding in the Court which passes the order. The proceeding being rather summary in nature, the object of the order being ad hoc and the duration of the order being temporary, the approach of the Court to such an order should be ut res magis valeat qnam pereat, to sustain it wherever possible and not to interfere unless intervention is irresistible in law. 2. That goes to explain as to why the Amendment Act of 1976 has taken care to make it clear by amending Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act that no appeal would be available against any such order, as prior to such amendment there was a view that such an order was appealable, though a contrary view was also maintained. Non-appealability, as pointed out by the privy Council in N.S. Venkatagiri Ayyangar, AIR 1949 PC 156 at p. 158, endows an order with some sort of finality and where, as here, the legislature, having found orders under Section 24 being challenged in appeal, has now taken away the same by an express amendment, the legislative intent must be taken to be more manifest that the order, right or wrong, is not to be disturbed on merits. This has been pointed out by one of us in the Division Bench decision of this Court in Ashit v. Susmita, . 3. But after hearing the learned counsel for the parties and going through the records ourselves, we are, however, satisfied that the instant case warrants our intervention even in revision as, in our view, the trial Judge in making the impugned order in the exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 24, Hindu Marriage Act, has acted illegally and with material irregularity within the meaning of Section 115 of the Civil P. C. The provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act are reproduced hereinbelow : -- ""Where in any proceeding under this Act, it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding and monthly, during proceeding, such sum as having regard to the petitioner's own income and income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable."" 4. It is, therefore, obvious that the jurisdictional fact which would entitle a Court to exercise its powers under Section 24 is the want of independent income of the applicant spouse sufficient for her or his support and that such jurisdiction is to be exercised having regard to the applicant-spouse's own independent income and the income of the non-applicant spouse. And itDr. Utpal Kumar Banerjee vs Smt. Majula Debi Banerjee on 11 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/283382/ 1should, therefore, be equally obvious that if a Court invokes Section 24 without finding that the applicant has no independent income sufficient for her or his support or passes an order without having regard to the respective income of the parties, it exercises its jurisdiction illegally and with material irregularity to warrant interdiction in revision under Section 115(1)(c) of the Civil P. C. 5. It appears from the impugned order that the trial Court has found that while the applicant-wife's independent income is £ 40.27 per week, the weekly expenses of the wife with the children should be assessed at £ 54.50 and ""the she runs a deficit of £ 14.23 per week."" The Court has also found that the husband ""has Rs. 1800/- per month left to himself"" as his income. And by the impugned order, the Court has directed the husband to pay to the wife Rs. 900/- per month as maintenance pendente lite. 6. From the materials on record it appears that the wife is living away in United Kingdom for several years prior to the institution of this matrimonial proceeding by the husband and has supported herself all these years without any contribution from the husband. She is obviously entitled to spend whatever she can and it may be that while she is earning about £ 40 per week, she is spending much more. But in this application filed by her under Section 24, Hindu Marriage Act, we are not so much concerned with what she is getting and spending, but what she can claim as reasonably necessary for her support. We do not take this to be the law that under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the applicant spouse is only to produce her or his monthly account or budget and would automatically be entitled to the amount of deficit from the non-applicant spouse, but that a spouse would be entitled only to such an amount which can be reasonably necessary for her or his support as the spouse of the opposite party, after deducting therefrom the income, if any, of the applicant spouse. As we have pointed out in Chitra v. Dhruba, , in the class-ridden society that we live in, the amount reasonably sufficient for the support of a woman as the wife of a man for the purpose of Section 24 must have a reasonable correlation with the income of the husband and, however much one may resent, what may be held to be reasonably necessary for the support of the wife of a rich businessman or a high salaried officer, cannot be regarded to be reasonably necessary for the support of the wife of a petty clerk or a small trader. If the amount of maintenance awardable to a wife under Section 24 is to be determined on the basis of the income of the husband then the amount which can be regarded to be reasonably sufficient for her support must also depend on and vary with the same. Since a woman can invoke Section 24 only as the wife of a man, the amount necessary for her support within the meaning of that Section would cover only such amount as can be reasonably necessary for the necessaries suited to the status and position that she can enjoy as the wife of her husband. A woman, even though having an income on the higher side, may still show that she requires yet a higher amount for meeting her expenses according to her own status and standard. But in order to entitle her to any pendente lite maintenance under Section 24 as the wife of her husband, she would have to show that the amount that she earns is not reasonably sufficient for her support in accordance with the status and position she would have as the wife of her husband. It is in this view of the matter that we have in Chitra v. Dhruba (supra) awarded the wife pendente lite maintenance to the tune of Rs. 5758/- per month even though the wife was having an independent income of her own of about Rs. 1200/- per month, as the husband in that case was found to have an income of £ 40000 per annum. Be that as it may, what we are trying to impress is that a wife cannot be held to be entitled to maintenance pendente lite under Section 24, HinduDr. Utpal Kumar Banerjee vs Smt. Majula Debi Banerjee on 11 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/283382/ 2Marriage Act solely or simply on the ground that she is running in deficit in running her separate household. The trial Court would have jurisdiction to award maintenance under that Section only on the finding that the applicant wife has no independent income sufficient for her support and what amount would be sufficient for the support of the wife must be determined on the basis of the income of the husband. The trial Court not having determined as to what amount the wife applicant can reasonably claim for her support as the wife of the husband opposite party and not having found that she does not earn that income, the absence of the jurisdictional fact to invest the Court with the jurisdiction to invoke Section 24 is apparent on the face of the record. 7. Under Section 36 of the Divorce Act, 1869 and under Section 39 of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, pendente lite maintenance can be awarded only to the extent of one-fifth of the husband's net monthly average income. Though Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act has fixed no such ceiling, a Division Bench of this Court in Surendra Nath v. Puspa, (1978) 2 Cal LJ 602 at P. 604 has accepted that limit to be ordinarily a safe guide, in the absence of special circumstances. For there may be special circumstances which may justifiably require the award of pendente lite maintenance for an amount more than one-fifth of the husband's income as in a case where a deserted wife has to maintain herself along with several minor children. We are not required in this case to decide as to what share of the husband's monthly income a wife is entitled to as a general rule under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It may be that, if the wife is the half of the husband (better or worse) or the Ardhangini (as according to the Hindu notion), then she may in a given case claim the half of the 'Husband's income to be awardable to her as pendente lite maintenance. But the trial Judge ought to have considered that the wife having Admittedly an income of £ 40.27 per week or about Rs. 2700/- per month while the husband has monthly income of Rs. 1800/- per month, whether the wife can still be regarded as not to have any income sufficient for her support as the wife of a husband belonging to that income group. In that backdrop, the trial Judge was required to ""have regard'' to the respective income of the wife and the husband being about Rs. 2700/- and Rs. 1800/- per month respectively, and after having due regard thereto, was required to find as to whether any further amount could be reasonably necessary for the wife for her support as the wife of her husband It has been found by the trial Judge that the wife has purchased and is maintaining a car of her own. The trial Judge ought to have told us, before ordering payment of maintenance by the husband, that the wife, who has purchased and is maintaining a personal car of her own, cannot still maintain herself. The trial Court not having approached the matter from the proper perspective has made an illegal exercise of its jurisdiction. 8. The learned Counsel for the husband respondent has also assailed the impugned order on the ground that the Court below has also taken into consideration the expenses necessary for the two minor daughters. It is true that Section 24 in terms provides only for maintenance awardable to the wife while Section 26 deals with maintenance of minor children. But as has been pointed out by one of us in the Division Bench decision of this Court in Manoj v. Lila, , under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, interim order for maintenance and education, as distinguished from post-decree orders for permanent maintenance, for the minor children can be made even without any formal application in writing and that a Court has perfect jurisdiction to grant pendente lite maintenance to minor children even without the formal application and, therefore, granting of such maintenance to the minor children, even when moved by an application labelled as one under Section 24 only,Dr. Utpal Kumar Banerjee vs Smt.

This appeal by the wife, C. Sarala, is against the decree of divorce in favour of her husband K. Nalinakshan, made by the learned Additional Sub Judge, Trivandrum, in O.P. (HMA) No. 49/81. The learned Judge upheld the respondent's case that the appellant deserted the respondent without any cause on 29-8-1974. In this judgment, the appellant and respondent are referred to as Wife and Husband respectively or W and H for the sake of brevity. 2. The parties were married on 30-5-1958 according to Hindu rites and lived together at Patton till 29-8-1974. There are three daughters born of this wed-lock, two of them since married while living with the wife. There is no dispute that the wife physically left the husband's house on 29-8-1974. What is disputed is the element of desertion, for the wife urges that she was driven out by the husband after continued ill-treatment. Before considering whether the wife deserted the husband on 29-8-1974, a reference to certain previous proceedings between the H and W is necessary. The details of these proceedings are set out in para No. 3 below. 3. In 1975, the H filed OP (HMA) No. 49 of 1975 (Ext. B1) for a decree of restitution of conjugal rights. The petition was dismissed after a contest. The findings of the court delivered on 31-3-1976, have become final, as no appeal was preferred against the dismissal of the petition. The conclusions arrived at by the subordinate judge, Trivandrum, were :-- (i) The husband's story about desertion by the wife on 28/29-8-1974 without any cause was rejected. The testimony of the daughter (C.P.W. 2) who was then 14 years of age, and schooling was accepted. (ii) The husband physically assaulted the wife almost every day. (iii) On 29-8-1974, the H beat and physically chased the W around, the H carrying stones in his hand. Therefore she left the house, (iv) The W was driven to leave the H's house and live separately because the H treated her with cruelty. 4. The second proceeding between the parties was the wife's suit O.S. No. 60 of 1975 against the husband, for alimony. The subordinate judge, Trivandrum, on evaluation of the evidence of the H, W, their daughter, and neighbours held that the husband had treated the wife with such cruelty as to cause reasonable apprehension in the wife's mind that it will be harmful and injurious to live with the husband and therefore she was justified in living separately and claim alimony. A decree for maintenance was made in favour of the daughters. The wife was not granted maintenance as she had separate income as a teacher. This decree was made on 31st March, 1976.C. Sarala vs K. Nalinakshan on 26 June, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1048387/ 1The third and the last litigation between the parties, was a petition for divorce filed by the H before the subordinate Judge, Trivandrum. It was OP (HMA) No. 96 of 1978 (Ext. B 3). In this petition, the husband made the following accusations against the wife : (a) The wife deserted him on 29-8-1974 without any cause. (b) The wife treated the husband with cruelty by making false allegations of adultery, (c) The wife is ""now living in adultery"". The O.P. (HMA) No. 96 of 1978, containing the above allegations was dismissed for default of appearance and was never restored. (4) On the arguments advanced before us and on the admitted facts set out in paragraph Nos. 2 and 3 above the following questions arise for consideration :-- (i) Do the findings in O.P. (HMA) 49/1975 and O.S. 60/1975 that the H, treated the W with cruelty and on 29-8-1974, drove her out, preclude in the present proceedings the trial of the issue of desertion by the W on 29-8-1974 on the doctrine of Res Judicata? (ii) The OP (HMA) No. 96/1978 in which the H avered that the wife deserted him on 29-8-1974 was dismissed for default. Having regard to the provisions of Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is the O.P. (HMA) 49/81 out of which this M.F.A. arises, maintainable? (iii) In view of the decision against the husband in the three previous cases, referred to in paragraph 3 above, is the institution and prosecution of the O.P. (HMA) No. 49 of 1981, an abuse of process of the court? (iv) Has the wife deserted the husband from 29-8-1974? 5. The essence of the doctrine of Res Judicata is that judgment of a court upon a point is conclusive between the same parties and is, as a plea, a bar or as evidence, conclusive, in a subsequent proceeding. The rule of res Judicata bars the trial of an issue which arose directly and substantially in a previous proceeding and has been adjudicated upon in such proceeding. The rule is founded in two principles. Firstly a litigant should not be vexed twice for the same cause and secondly public policy requires that all litigations must end at some point of time. 6. Although the doctrine of Res Judicata finds legislative expression in Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the section is not exhaustive of all circumstances in which an issue may be Res Judicata. The doctrine exists apart from the limited compass of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The doctrine has been applied, to cases to which Section 11 does not strictly apply. It has been applied to execution proceedings, Ram Kirpal Shukul v.

It has been stated above that the doctrine of res Judicata applies to cases under various special Acts. In our opinion it should be applied to the cases under the Hindu Marriage Act also. The O.P. (HMA) 49 of 1975 by the H was for decree of restitution of conjugal rights and O.S. No. 60 of 1975 by the W, was, for maintenance, In both the proceedings the W raised one defence. The H beat her, treated her with cruelty and compelled her to leave the matrimonial home. The H and W led evidence on this question and invited a finding from the court. The finding was necessary because if it went in favour of the W, she was justified in living away from the H, disentitling the H to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights and entitling the wife to maintenance. For this reason the finding on this matter was directly and substantially in issue in the previous proceedings. In the present O.P. (HMA) 49 of 1981, the H once again urges that the W deserted him on 29-8-1974. In the previous proceedings too, he had pleaded desertion with reference to the same date. The defence of the W is that she was driven out after cruel treatment. The essence of desertion is that W had the animus deserendi. It has been found in the two earlier proceedings that the W did not leave the house voluntarily but was beaten and driven out. There is therefore a conclusive finding in two previous proceedings between the same parties that the wife did not intend to leave the Husband or the matrimonial home. This finding was delivered on a matter which was directly and substantially in issue. Therefore the H is precluded from raising the question of desertion by the W in O.P. (HMA) 49 of 1981. The reason is that in the two previous proceedings there is a conclusive finding that the W's act of leaving the H lacked the essential element of desertion viz. animus deserendi. 8. No doubt in the O.P. (HMA) No. 49 / 1975 and O.S. 60 of 1975 the reliefs sought by the H and W were different from the relief of divorce sought in the petition giving rise to this appeal. In our opinion the difference in the reliefs in the previous and the present proceedingsd is immaterial. What is of the essence is that the ""matter"" should be ""directly and substantially"" in issue in both the sets of proceedings. On the same set of facts which is the ""matter"", different reliefs could be claimed. Therefore reliefs are not of importance. In Trilok Singh's case, Trilok Singh v. Smt. Savitri Devi, AIR 1972 All 52 where facts were identical, the Allahabad High Court held that the finding in the suit for restitution of conjugal rights that the wife was turned out of the house, barred in a subsequent petition by the H for judicial separation, trial of the issue whether the W deserted him. We concur with this view. For the reasons stated in the foregoing paragraphs we hold that the O.P. (HMA) 49 of 1981 is barred by principles of Res judicata.C. Sarala vs K.

252,"Gujarat High Court Lallubhai Keshavram Joshi vs Nirmalaben Lalluram Joshi on 3 August, 1971 Equivalent citations: AIR 1972 Guj 174, (1972) GLR 626 Bench: A Dave JUDGMENT 1. This appeal raises a very important question of law. In order to appreciate the implications involved in this appeal it will be worth-while to state the facts giving rise to this appeal in a nut-shell. 2. The appellant before this court is the husband of the present respondent Nirmalaben. The appellant had filed a petition No. 8 of 1966 under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights on the ground that she had withdrawn herself from the society without any reasonable cause. During the pendency of the said petition, the present respondent gave an application under Section 24 of the Act for getting maintenance pendente lite and expenses of the proceeding. The learned trial Judge held that the present respondent had proved that she had no income of her own and that her husband was earning Rs. 100 to 125/- per month. In the opinion of the learned trial Judge, therefore, she was entitled to receive Rs. 25/- per month as maintenance and Rs. 50/- as costs of the proceeding. However, the learned trial Judge dismissed the application of the respondent for interim maintenance on the ground that she was disentitled to receive the same on account of her conduct. Against the said order of the learned trial Judge, an appeal was preferred in the district Court and the learned District Judge allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the trial Court. He ordered that the present respondent should receive Rs, 25/- as monthly maintenance and Rs.50/- as expenses for defending herself in the main proceeding. Against the said order of the learned District Judge, the present has been preferred to this court. 3. Mr. I. C. Bhatt, learned Advocate for the appellant submitted that the learned District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the order passed by the Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In support of his say he referred to the case of Prithvirajsinhji Mansinghji v. Shivprabhakumari. AIR 1962 Bom 315. In order, therefore, to understand the implication it will be necessary to refer to Sections 24 and 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 24 says- ""Where in any proceeding under this Act, it appears to the court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent in come sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order respondent the respondent to pay the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding, such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the court to be reasonable."" Thus whenever any proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act is pending before the court, it is competent for that court to pass interim with regard to the maintenance and expenses of the proceeding of either party, if the court came to the conclusion that the husband or wife as the case may be, had no independent income sufficient for his or her support. Apparently, this section is independent of other provisions of the Act and is not controlled by Section 23 thereof. Even theLallubhai Keshavram Joshi vs Nirmalaben Lalluram Joshi on 3 August, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/513239/ 1learned trial Judge negatived the contention of the learned advocate for the present appellant that Section 24 was controlled by the provisions of Section 23. Curiously, however, the learned Judge observed that the conduct of the wife is borne out from her own evidence which prevents her from getting any relief under Sec. 24 of the Act and taking into consideration her conduct, the learned trial judge dismissed the application for maintenance pendence life. The learned district Judge who heard the appeal against the said order was of the opinion that provisions of Section 24 of the Act were not controlled by Section 23 or any other section and ordered the present appellant to pay Rs. 25/- per month as maintenance pendente lite and Rs. 50/- towards the expenses of the proceeding in my opinion, the view taken by the learned District Judge is correct. Provisions of Section 24 as seen from the wordings of the section itself clearly indicate that they are not controlled by the provisions contained in any other section of the Act. In order to award maintenance pendente lite to the wife or the husband as the case may be, the court has merely to consider whether he or she has any independent income sufficient for his or her support. If the court from the evidence before it holds that he or she had no independent income for his or her support, the court is competent to pass an order for maintenance pendente lite under Section 24 of the act, conduct of either party is immaterial. In fact, Section 24 of the Act does not entitle the court to look into the conduct of the either party at all before passing any such order. If the conduct of a party was to be taken into consideration for passing any order, there would have been appropriate provisions in the Section itself as is found in Section 25 of the Act. Section 25(1) states- ""Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property if any, the income and other property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent"". Thus, while passing an order for maintenance under Section 25 of the Act, it would be open to the court to take into consideration the conduct of the parties. Section 24 does not include any such words. Therefore, while passing an order for maintenance pendente life, the court cannot look into the question of conduct of the parties. As stated earlier, only while passing an order for maintenance under Section 25 of the Act conduct of the parties would be relevant. In my opinion, therefore, the learned trial Judge was clearly in error in refusing to pass an order for maintenance pendente lite and expenses of the proceeding on the ground of alleged conduct of the wife. 4. Mr. Bhatt, however, urged that if the order of the learned trial Judge was wrong, it was open to the wife to file a revision petition before this court. He urged that no appeal to the district court was provided against an interim order under the Act, and therefore, the order passed by the learned District Judge was clearly without jurisdictions made by Mr. Bhatt, it will be profitable to refer to Section 28 of the Act which says-Lallubhai Keshavram Joshi vs Nirmalaben Lalluram Joshi on 3 August, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/513239/ 2""All decrees and orders made by the courts in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force: Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of costs only"". Section 28, therefore, envisages that all decrees and orders under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Similarly, it envisages that all decrees and orders made by the court in any proceeding under this Act may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. The only restriction is that no appeal shall lie on the subject of costs only. The learned Advocate for the appellant, however, submitted that it is not that each and every order made by the court in a proceeding would be appealable but only such order which was under any law for the time being in force would be appealable. He submitted that the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" would indicate Civil Procedure Code. Therefore, he submitted that the interim order passed by the court in any proceeding cannot the subject-matter of an appeal, unless it came within the provisions of Section 104 or Order 43, Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. In my opinion, the construction put upon Section 28 of the Act by Mr. Bhatt is very narrow and unwarranted. The Civil Procedure Code would be applicable only with regard to the procedure governing an appeal and has nothing to so with the right of an appeal. Section 21 of the Act says- ""Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908"". In my opinion, therefore, the applicability of the Code of Civil Procedure to the proceedings under this Act will be only for laying down procedure and no more. The Civil Procedure Code does not contain any provision for a right to appeal under any other law. The right to appeal under the Hindu Marriage Act is provided in Section 28. It clearly says that all decrees and orders may be appealed from under any law of the time being in force. In my opinion, the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" would mean that the procedure governing an appeal will be the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code and the law for the time being in force for determining the forum of appeal is the Bombay Civil Courts Act. In the case of Gangadhar Rakhamaji v. Manjula . AIR 1960 Bom 42, the question about the interpretation of the words ""law for the time being in force"" arose, and the division bench of the Bombay High Court after considering Section 28 of the Act, observed as follows:-- ""............. ""law for the time being in force"" for determining the forum of appeal is the Bombay Civil Courts Act. Under Section 8 of that Act an appeal from the decree or order of a Civil Judge, Senior Division, lies to the District Court except in the case of decision in suits where the amount or value of the subject-matter exceeds ten thousand rupees. Under the Bombay Civil Courts Act, a District Court is presided over by a District Judge and is the principal court of original civil jurisdiction in the district within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the present case, the decree having been passed by the court of the Civil Judge Senior Division of Ahmednagar, in a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act, the appeal should lie to the District Court of Ahmednagar"".Lallubhai Keshavram Joshi vs Nirmalaben Lalluram Joshi on 3 August, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/513239/ 3","['23', '10', '24', '8', '21', '9', '28', '25']"
253,"Punjab-Haryana High Court Sunder Singh vs Manna Sunder Singh on 28 July, 1961 Equivalent citations: AIR 1962 P H 127 Bench: K Gosain ORDER (1) This appeal arises out of an unfortunate litigation between a husband and his wife. Mrs. Munna Sunder Singh wife of Shri Bawa Sunder Singh filed an application for judicial separation against her husband under Sec.10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in the Court of the learned District Judge at Delhi. She also moved an application for maintenance pendente lite and for expenses of the proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. She claimed that her husband should be ordered to pay her a sum of Rs.3,000/- for expenses of the proceedings and a sum of Rs.2,500/- per mensem for her maintenance during the pendency of the proceedings. In this application the alleged that her husband was a rich man having property worth several lacs and deriving monthly income of not less than Rs.15,000/- from various sources. She also alleged that she herself had no source of income and owned no movable or immovable property except share scrips valued at about Rs.90,000/-, which were in the possession of her husband and which could not be availed of by her at the moment. This application was opposed by her husband Shri Bawa Sunder Singh, who repudiated her claim in its entirety. In his reply he stated that it was false to suggest that his monthly income was Rs.15,000/- or that he owned property to the extent alleged by the petitioner. He himself, however, did not give any idea either of the value of property owned by him or of the income earned by him every month. He alleged that the petitioner had sold certain shares of the value of Rs. 96,000/- some two years before the petition and that she was in possession of the said amount. He further alleged that there was jewellery in her possession worth rupees three lacs and that she was the daughter of a wealthy person who was supporting her in her ""frivolous litigation"" and was in a position to support her. He also alleged that she was having an income of Rs.500 per mensem in her capacity as a director of a company. The petitioner then filed replication denying the sale of the shares worth Rs.96,000 as also the fact of the jewellery worth rupees three lacs being in her possession. She repudiated the suggestion that her parents were supporting her in the litigation and denied that she was earning Rs. 500 as a director. She at the same time filed an application under section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code requesting the Court to order the respondent to make specific denials or admissions with regard to the extent of his property, as also of the monthly income, and stated in that application that the reply filed by the respondent was absolutely vague and that the respondent had evaded to give clear facts. A reply to this application was filed by Shri Bawa Sunder Singh who, along with it, filed a sworn affidavit dated the 9th of December, 1960. It is rather curious that in this reply or affidavit also the respondent did not give a very clear position about the extent of his property or his income and did not make a clear denial that his monthly income was not Rs. 15,000/- that he did not posses property worth several lacs. The affidavit, referred to above, consists of five pages but the respondent has not chosen to state anywhere in this affidavit what sources of income he had and what monthly income he was making from each of these sources. In paragraph 12 of the same he has admitted that he was a partner ofSunder Singh vs Manna Sunder Singh on 28 July, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1270485/ 1Messers Spedding Dinga Singh and Company, which was doing timber business, but has stated that the said business had made no profit for the last many years. He has also stated that neither the firm nor he were paying any income-tax for the last several years. With regard to the property or wealth that he possessed, he has simply stated that the figures given by his wife were highly exaggerated. The petitioner filed another affidavit on 5th of January. 1961, in reply to that of her husband and in this affidavit she stated with clarity the various sources of income which the respondent had and the earnings that he was having from the same. Along with it she filed annexure 'A' giving the details of her husband's wealth and wealth tax figures. The respondent asked for an opportunity of filing an affidavit in reply to the affidavit of his wife dated 5th January, 1961,but he chose not to file the same. The learned District Judge went into the matter and by his order dated 25th of January, 1961, he came to the conclusion that the petitioner was entitled to Rs. 3,000 as expenses of litigation and was also entitled to a maintenance allowance of Rs.2,500 per mensem for as long as the litigation lasted. In this order he found that the petitioner had never sold the shares worth Rs.96,000/-, and did not, therefore, possess the said amount. He also found that she was not possessed of jewellery as alleged by her husband and that she was not getting any income from the Directorship of Messrs Bawa Timber Private Limited. It was not contested before the learned Additional District judge that the father of the petitioner was a wealthy gentleman, but he came to the conclusion that this matter was of no consequence at all in deciding whether the petitioner was or was not entitled to the relief under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Aggrieved against the aforesaid decision of the learned Additional District Judge the respondent, Shri Bawa Sunder Singh, has come up to this Court in first appeal. (2) A preliminary objection is taken on behalf of the respondent that no appeal lies against the order in question. It is contended that an order under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be deemed to be a decree as defined in section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and cannot be appealed against as such. It is further contended that such an order does not also fall within the category of any of the appealable orders which are mentioned in detail in section 104 and Order 43, rule1 of the Civil Procedure Code. Reliance for this proposition is placed on a Single Bench judgment of the Bombay High Court in Prithyirajsingji Mansinghji v. Shivaprabha Kumari, AIR 1960 Bom 315. There a petition for revision had been filed against an order of a Subordinate Judge made under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. At the hearing a preliminary objection was taken that the order was appealable under section 28 of the said Act and that the petition for revision, therefore, was not maintainable. This preliminary objection was repelled by Gokhale J. who decided that case and it was held that-- ""What the Legislature intended by referring to the words 'any law for the time being in force in section 28 was that the appealiability of decrees and orders should be determined by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Thus section 28 does not provide for an appeal against every order made by the Court in the proceedings under the Act, but only such orders which can fall within the definition of decrees under section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code or with regard to which an appeal is provided under the Code An order granting interim relief under section 24 has to be distinguished from an order granting permanent alimony and maintenance, which the Court canSunder Singh vs Manna Sunder Singh on 28 July, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1270485/ 2pass under section 25. Such an order cannot amount to a decree as defined in section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and, therefore would not be appealable as decree, such an order does not fall also within section 104 nor under Order 43, rule 1 of the Code. It would not be therefore, appealable under the Civil Procedure Code. Hence revision application will be maintainable against such order."" Two Single Bench rulings of the Lahore High Court in R. C. Chamarette v. Mrs. P. E. Chamarette, AIR 1937 Lah 176, and Noble Millicons v. Mrs. Gladys Millicans, AIR 1937 Lah 862, were cited on behalf of the respondent in that case but they were not relied upon. (3) The counsel for the appellent urges that the order in question is an appealable one by reason of section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act and for this proposition he places reliance on a Division Bench ruling of the Calcutta High Court in Smt. Sobhana Sen v. Amar Kanta Sen, AIR 1959 Cal 455, and a Single Bench judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Rukhmambai v. Kishanlal Ramlal, AIR 1959 Madh Pra 187. Both these cases are direct authorities on the point and do support the contention of the learned counsel. Reliance is also placed by him on the two Lahore ruling, referred to above, which also support his contention. Language of section 55 of the Divorce Act, under which those rulings were given, and that of section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act is identically the same. (4) Now section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as under: ""All decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceedings under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the Court made in the exercise of the original civil jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force: Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of cots only."" The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" clearly show that every order is not made appealable and that for the purpose of finding whether any particular order is or is not appealable, a reference has to be made to the Civil Procedure Code to find whether such an order is a decree as defined in the said Code to find whether such an order is a decree as defined in the said Code or whether such an order is expressly made appealable under any of the two provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in which such orders are mentioned, namely, section 104 and Order 43, rule 1. His argument is that unless an order is a decree or is expressly made appealable under any of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code no appeal is competent against the same. AIR 1960 Bom 315, referred to above, no doubt supports this contention. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, is that all decrees and orders made by a court in any proceedings under the Act are liable to be appealed against and that the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" can be interpreted only to mean that the appeal shall be made in accordance with the Procedure provided for such appeals in any law which relates to the said procedure. His argument is that an appeal lies under section 28 itself but that the procedure for that appeal is prescribed by the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code Calcutta andSunder Singh vs Manna Sunder Singh on 28 July, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1270485/ 3",['24']

Mookerjee, J. 1. In this Rule a short point arises for consideration. The point, however, is of considerable and far-reaching importance and it has assumed some amount or complexity too, due to certain recent judicial pronouncements. The question, involved, is the question of jurisdiction of the learned Additional District Judges, or, rather, the Additional Judges, under the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act and other sister statutes. It covers a wide field and its decision one way or the other, may amount to much for the administration of law in this State, nay, for the entire Union, over the whole of which its reaction may be felt in varying degrees. But for the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kuldip Singh v. The State of Punjab, , the petitioner, who challenges the lower court's jurisdiction in the instant case before us, could have possibly advanced no argument whatsoever. The decisions of this Court, which may have any bearing on the above question of jurisdiction, are practically uniform and unanimous and all in one way, barring one or two which, again, appear to be covered by a Full Bench decision of this Court, and they are all against the petitioner. The petitioner, however, seeks to re-open the said question and he claims a decision in his favour, relying upon the above decision of the Supreme Court and upon the later Punjab High Court decision (Janak Dulari v. Narayan Dass, purporting to explain the above Supreme Court decision and apply the same to the Punjab statute, the Punjab Courts Act, (Act VI of 1918). 2. The point arises in this way. The petitioner, as husband, instituted Suit No. 27 of 1957 in the court of the District Judge of Midnapore, under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for dissolution of his marriage with the opposite party who was his wife by the said marriage. Fox our present purpose, it is not necessary to recite the various allegations, on which the above suit was founded, nor it is necessary to advert to any of the various defences or counter-allegations which were taken or made to the suit by the wife opposite party. It is enough to state, for purposes of this Rule that, on or about the 22nd August, 1958, the learned District Judge transferred the aforesaid suit to the First Court of the Additional District Judge, Midnapore, for disposal and, thereupon, on or about March 16, 1959, the petitioner filed, before the learned Additional District Judge, Sri Tapendra Kumar Pal, an application contending, inter alia, that the said learned Judge had no jurisdiction to try the aforesaid suit and praying for re-transfer of the same to the learned District Judge. The petitioner's contention was that, in view of the terms of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, read with the definition Section (Section 3(b)), the District Judge and the District Judge alone had jurisdiction to entertain and try the instant suit and, in the absence of any Notification of the State Government, empowering him to try such suits, the learned Additional District Judge had no jurisdiction in the matter, notwithstanding the transfer (assignment) to him by the learned District Judge, such transfer, though, presumably, under Section 8(2) of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, not being, according to the petitioner, competent, -- and not purporting also --to confer jurisdiction, not possessed by the transferee court. The petitioner's contention was rejected by the learned Additional District Judge. Hence the present Rule.Ajit Kumar Bhunia vs Sm. Kanan Bala Deyi on 4 January, 1960 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1985015/ 13. Under Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, every petition under the said Act has to be ""presented to the District Court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage, was solemnized, or the husband and the wife reside or last resided together,"" and the definition Section, Section 3(b), enacts that, in the aforesaid Act, ""unless the context otherwise requires, 'District Court' means in any area for which there is a City Civil Court, that Court, and in any other area the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, end includes any other Civil Court which may be specified by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in the Act'' and under Section 21 of the aforesaid Act, it is provided that ""subject to the other provisions, contained in the said Act, and to such rules as the High Court may make in that behalf, all proceedings under the said Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908."" 4. These are the relevant provisions of the Act, under which the suit in question was instituted, so far as the point of jurisdiction is concerned and the provisions of the other relevant statute, namely, the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act (Central Act XII of 1887) (hereinafter referred to also as the Bengal Act or Bengal Statute for brevity and convenience), which may have a direct bearing on this point, are : Section 3: ""There shall be the following classes of Civil Courts under this Act, namely: (1) The Court of the District Judge: (2) the Court of the Additional Judge; (3) the Court of the Subordinate Judge; and (4) the Court of the Munsif."" Section 4: ""The State Government may alter the number of District Judges. Subordinate Judges and Munsifs now fixed."" Section 6: ""(1) Whenever the office of District Judge or Subordinate Judge is vacant by reason of the death, resignation or removal of the Judge or other cause, or whenever an increase in the number of District or Subordinate Judges has been made under the provisions of Section 4, the State Government or, as the case may be, the High Court may fill up the vacancy or appoint the Additional District Judges or Subordinate Judges ........"" and Section 8 : ""(1) When, the business pending before any District Judge requires the aid of Additional Judges for its speedy disposal, the State Government may, having consulted the High Court,.. appoint such Additional Judges as may be requisite. (2) Additional Judges, so appointed, shall discharge any of the functions of a District Judge which the District Judge may assign to them, and, in the discharge of those functions, they shall exercise the same powers as the District Judge."" 5. Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure also, which entitles the District Judge to transfer cases to his subordinate courts, may be quoted in its relevant part, in view of certain purportedAjit Kumar Bhunia vs Sm. Kanan Bala Deyi on 4 January, 1960 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1985015/ 2observations, made in some of the decided cases, and the aforesaid Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, applying the Code to suits under the said Act. The material part of the aforesaid Section 24 of the said Code runs as follows: ""(1) ..... of its own motion .... the District Court may at any stage- (a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding, pending before it, for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same, .......... (3) For the purposes of this section, Courts of Additional and Assistant Judges shall be deemed to be subordinate to the District Court."" and the meaning of the term 'District Court', as used in the Code can be ascertained from the definition of 'District Court', contained in Section 2(4), which runs as follows: "" 'district' means the local limits of the jurisdiction of a principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction (hereinafter called a 'District Court') ......"" thus leading to the connotation that the 'District Court' means 'the principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction.' 6. These are all the relevant statutory provisions on the above Question of jurisdiction which is now before us for decision. 7. Turning to the decided cases, we would refer first to the Full Bench decision of this Court in the case of Rup Keshwar Lal v. Mt. Jaijai Bibi 19 Cal WN 791 : (AIR 1916 Cal 561) and then to the two subsequent decisions in the cases, Mohator Rahman v. Abdur Rahim ILR 48 Cal 53 : (AIR 1921 Cal 210) and Lal Behari Basak v. Akhil Chandra Santra 27 Cal WN 315 : (AIR 1923 Cal 469). No later case of this Court appears to be strictly relevant on the point and, of the earlier and intervening decisions, it would suffice to mention those in the cases of Rakhal Chandra Tewari v. Secretary of State, 8 Cal LJ 34; Bidya Moyee Debva v. Surya Kant Acharya, ILR 32 Cal 875; Mahomed Musa v. Abdul Hassan Khan 18 Cal WN 612 : (AIR 1914 Cal 616); and the two cases of Jogesh Chandra v. Rasik Lal Saha AIR 1919 Cal 133 and Jogabandhu Talukdar v. Nanda Lal Sirkar AIR 1919 Cal 720. 8. The three earliest, viz. 8 Cal LJ 34, ILR 32 Cal 875 and 18 Cal WN 612 : (AIR 1954 Cal 616) are covered by the Full Bench decision, referred to above, and, of them, the first, namely 8 Cal LJ 34, was approved. On the above decisions, it is practically settled in this Court, -- and that also is the position in the other High Courts (vide, Mutsaddi Lal v. Mule Mal ILR 34 All 205 and Makhan Lal v. Sri Lal, ILR 34 All 382 and Inderdeo Ojha v. Emperor, AIR 1945 Pat 322). -- that the Additional District Judge has, on transfer or assignment of a particular case to him by the learned District Judge under Section 8 of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, all the powers, authority and jurisdiction of the learned District Judge himself, so far as that case is concerned. The question now is whether this settled law has been unsettled or should be deemed to have become unsettled, by reason of the Supreme Court's decision, referred to above and relied on by the petitioner, and whether a different view should now be taken on the point in the light of that decision and theAjit Kumar Bhunia vs Sm.

Ramjibhai Lalbhai Patel of Talod Taluka Prantij. District Sabarkantha. is the husband of the respondent Smt. Shantaben. daughter of Manilal Kashkanbhai Patel; The appellant had filed H. M. P. No. 18/ 79 in the Court of the Civil judge (S-D). Ahmedabad (Rural) at Nerol under: Sec 13(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 as amended by Act No. 68 of 1976. to obtain a decree of divorce of his marriage with the respondent on the ground that she had deserted him for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. The perusal of the Rajnama discloses that on 19-9-1980 the record and proceedings were transferred from the Court of the Civil Judge (S. D.). Narol to the Extra Assistant Judge Narol under the orders of the District Judge. The matter was there after conducted and decided by the Extra Assistant Judge. Narol who by his judgment and order dated 17-8-1981 dismissed the petition with costs. Hence, the appellant has preferred this appeal.) (Paras 2 to 8 * * * * * *) 9. When I started delivering the judgment Mr, R. N. Shah interrupted to submit that he wanted to raise a question about the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain and hear this appeal. He submitted that in the circumstances of the present case appeal from the judgment of the Extra Assistant Judge Narol will not lie in the High Court but that it would lie in the District Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decision of the Extra Assistant Judge in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Although the issue was raised belatedly, I heard both the learned Advocates on the issue as it was a jurisdictional issue. 10. A similar issue was raised in First Appeal No. 1158/81 which I decided on 2-4-1984: (reported in AIR 1984 NOC 258 (Guj)). It was also a matrimonial matter and divorce was sought on the ground of legal cruelty and desertion for a continuous period exceeding two Years immediately preceding the presentation of the Petition. It was also a petition which was decided by the Extra Assistant Judge Narol. Mr. G. D. Bhatt. Advocate .appeared for the respondent in ,that matter and he raised a preliminary issue about the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain and hear the appeal from the judgment and order of the Extra Assistant judge. The contention was that an appeal would lie to the District Judge at Narol and not to the High Court It was also submitted that the appeal before the High Court was not competent. It was submitted in that appeal that in paragraph 17 of the original application it was stated that for the purpose of court-fees, advocate-fees and jurisdiction the valuation was made at Rs. 5/- and a fixed court-fees stamp of Rs. 37-50 was utilised for the purpose of court-fees. My attention was invited to Sees. 16. 24. 25 and 26 of the Bombay Civil CourtsAct. 1869. Section 16 reads as under:- ""16. original Jurisdiction of Assistant Judge. - The District Judge may refer to anv Assistant Judge subordinate to him original suits of which the subject-matter (is of any) amount or value, (applications or references under Special Acts) and miscellaneous applications.Ramjibhai Lalbhai Patel vs Shantaben on 25 April, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/845010/ 1The Assistant Judge shall have jurisdiction to try such suits and to dispose of such applications (or references). Where the Assistant Judge's decrees and orders in such cases are appealable, the appeal shall lie to the District Judge or to the High Court according as the amount or value of the subject-matter does not exceed or exceeds twenty thousand rupees."" 11. Section 24 of the said Act refers to jurisdiction of the Civil Judge (Senior Division and jurisdiction of Civil Judge (Junior Division). It is prescribed that the jurisdiction of a Civil Judge (Senior Division) extends to all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature and the jurisdiction of a Civil judge (Junior Division) extends to all original suits and proceedings of a civil nature where in the subject-matter does not exceed in amount or value twenty thousand rupees. Section 25 refers to the jurisdiction of Civil Judge (Senior division), and states that a Civil Judge (Senior Division) in addition, to his ordinary jurisdiction shall exercise a special jurisdiction in respect of such suits and proceedings of a civil nature as may arise within the local jurisdiction of the Courts in the district presided over by Civil Judges (Junior Division) and wherein the subject-matter exceeds the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Civil judge (Junior Division) as defined by Section 24. Section 26 of the said Act refers to appeal from the decision of a Senior Division Judge of which the amount or value of the subject-matter exceeds twenty thousand rupees the appeal from his decision shall lie direct to the High Court. 12. So far as the appeals from the orders and decrees of the Assistant Judge is concerned. I have ascertained that under Section 16 it is prescribed that the appeal shall lie to the District Judge or to the High Court according as the amount or value of the subject-matter does not exceed or exceeds twenty thousand rupees. The appellate provisions with regard to the appeals from orders and decrees of the Civil Judge (S. D.) and from the decrees and orders of the Assistant Judge are in pari materia. 13. My attention was then drawn to Sections 8 and 9 of the Suits Valuation Act. 1887. Section 8 relates to those cases wherein court-fee value and jurisdiction value are to be the same. Section 9 is relevant for our purpose. Sec tion 9 runs as under:- ""9. When the subject-matter of suits of any class other than suits mentioned in the Court-fees Act 1870. Section 7, paragraphs v and vi and paragraph x, clause (d) is such that in the opinion of the High Court it does not admit of being satisfactorilv valued. the High Court may with the previous sanction of the State Government. direct that suits of that class shall for the purposes of the Court-fees Act. 1870 and of this Act and any other enactment for the time being in force be treated as if their subject-matter. were of such value as the High Court thinks fit to specify in this behalf."" Reading Section 9. it becomes clear that the Plaintiff or the applicant as the case may be is entitled to put his own valuation for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction under Section 9 of the Suits valuation Act. 1887. In the above stated appeal that was precisely what the applicant had done at paragraph 17 of his application. He had valued the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction at 5/-. Under Section 16 of the Bombay Civil Courts Act. 1869. referred to above, the appeal from the decision ofRamjibhai Lalbhai Patel vs Shantaben on 25 April, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/845010/ 2the Assistant Judge would lie to the District Judge and not the High Court as the amount or value of the subject-matter as fixed by the appellant in his application does not exceed Rs. 20,000/-. Under Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. ""District Court"" is defined as under :- ""3. (b) ""district court"" means in any area for which there is a city civil court that court and in any other area the principal civil court of original jurisdiction and includes any other civil court which may be specified by the State Government by notification in the official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in this Act:"" It is true that so far as the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and the proceedings thereunder are concerned, an Assistant Judge would indeed be a District Judge under Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act but he would not be a District Judge for the purpose Of determining the forum of appeal as that question does not fall within the ambit of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955. Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act is very clear on this point. Section 28 runs as under :- ""28. Appeals from decrees and orders.(1) All decrees made by the court in any proceeding under this Act shall subject to the provisions of sub-section (3). be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (2) Orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act under See. 25 or Section 26 shall. subject to the Provisions of sub-section (3). be appealable if they are not interim orders. and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction."" Under Section 28(1). the appeal lies to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decision of the Court given in the exercise Of its original civil jurisdiction. The forum of appeal is prescribed under Section 16 of the Bombay Civil Courts Act and therefore for determining the forum of appeal we must make a reference to Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955 read with Section 16 of the Bombay Civil Courts Act. 1869 and that the forum would not be determined by the definition of ""district Court"" under Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 14. The above-stated Proposition finds support from the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Gangadhar Rakhamaji v. Manjulal Gangadhar, AIR 1960 Bom 42 wherein this question has been considered fully. The decision of the Division Bench in Appeal No. 234/ 58 was decided on 29-10-1958 and therefore the ratio of the above judgment is binding on me. In Gangadhar's case (supra). the Division Bench considered the submission placed before it that the Court of the Civil Judge (S. D.) was a District Court under the definition of the ""district Court"" as given in Section 3(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and that the appeal would lie directly to the High Court. but that submission was negatived by the Division Bench. 15. In First Appeal No. 11581/81 upheld the preliminary objection raised by Mr. G. D. Bhatt and I decided that the appeal which was filed in this Court was not maintainable. Accordingly the direction was given that the appeal memo and the papers filed with it be returned to the appellantRamjibhai Lalbhai Patel vs Shantaben on 25 April, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/845010/ 3","['26', '16', '3', '24', '8', '9', '28', '7', '25']"

The applicant Hariram has filed this application against the order of the Assistant Judge, Nagpur, in Civil Appeal No. 200-A of 1960, rejecting his appeal against an order under Order 7, Rule 10, Civil Procedure Code, by which the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur returned his peti-tion for granting a decree of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for presentation to proper Court. 2. No appearance is put in on behalf of the opponent though names of two counsel are shown as having entered appearance on behalf of the opponent. Shri R. N. Deshpande, an Advocate of this Court, intimated at the commencement of the hearing that Shri K. S. Mishra was in charge of the case and he had no instructions. I have declined to adjourn the hearing as the case was posted as first case on today's board of which notice was duly given in the Daily Board. 3. The case of the applicant is that he was married under Hindu law to the opponent Shrimati Jasoti in August 1944 at Karachi in Sindh before the partition. There is no doubt that Karachi is now a part of Pakistan and therefore a foreign territory. The allegation in the plaint is that about six months prior to the partition, the applicant discovered that his wife [the opponent) had deceived him into marriage and that she was not faithful. They therefore separated while in Karachi about six months prior to the partition. That partition of India took place on and from 15th August 1947. As soon as the scheme for partition was launched the applicant came to India and so did the opponent Jasoti but separately. The applicant's case is that after having separated from his wife at Karachi itself about six months prior to partition, they never resided together and in fact he was not aware of the whereabouts of his wife since partition. The applicant took a job in Delhi and is now serving, with the Government of India as a gazetted Officer in the Export Import Department of the Central Ministry. It is alleged that the opponent Shrimati Jasoti is employed in the Telephone Department at Nagpur and is alleged to be staying with someone in adultery at Nagpur. The applicant, did not know about the whereabouts of his wife till 1953 when some correspondence seems to have commenced between the two. Thereafter the applicant came to Nagpur and made enquiries and learnt that the opponent was leading an adulterous life. He therefore filed an application in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur, on 30th August 1959, claiming a decree for divorce on the ground that the opponent was living in adultery. 4. When the case was taken up by the Presiding Officer of that Court, it appears the case proceeded ex parte against the opponent. But the learned Judge felt some doubt about his jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the applicant. The applicant has disclosed the cause of action for his petition in paragraph 13 of his application as follows : ""That the cause of action for petition arose in August, 1944, and January, 1946, and in years 1948, 49, 50, of till today between the parties and when the respondent, deserted the petitioner andHariram Dhalumal Karamchandani vs Jasoti on 15 June, 1962 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1830757/ 1continued to live in adultery respectively at Karachi and Nagpur, within the territorial limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this court and this Honourable Court has jurisdiction to try this suit."" This passage is now explained by the learned counsel appearing for the applicant to mean that the opponent is living an adulterous life since they separated while in Karachi itself, and that they never have been together since separation in Karachi six months prior to the partition. 5. The learned Judge of the original Court referring to Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act held that the conditions of that section for invoking the jurisdiction of his Court were not satisfied inasmuch as neither was the marriage solemnised within the jurisdiction of his Court, nor was it the case that the husband and wife resided or last resided together within the jurisdiction of his Court. It was claimed before the learned Judge that even if conditions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not complied with, in the instant case the Court would have jurisdiction under Section 20, Civil Procedure Code, which was expressly made applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act by Section 21. Section 21 is as follows: ""Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, ad proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1903."" : It was urged on behalf of the applicant before the first Court that apart from the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act the applicant would have a right to file the petition before that Court if any of the conditions of Section 20 regarding jurisdiction of the Court were satisfied; in particular, the applicant relied on two facts, namely, that the opponent who was in the position of a defendant to the action was admittedly residing within the jurisdiction of the a trial Court, and further the applicant had alleged that the cause of action, namely, the course of adulterous living, had taken place also within the jurisdiction of the trial Court. But the learned Judge did not accept this contention and declined to exercise jurisdiction. In dealing with this argument the learned Judge has observed as follows;  ""...... the petitioner's learned    counsel had said that provisions of the Civil Pro. Code regarding the place of suing govern such cases also. But I am unable to find any substance in that contention. Undoubtedly, Section 21 of this ACT makes provision of Civil Procedure Code applicable to all proceedings under this Act. But that Section 21 opens with the wording:  'Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act...' That means, Section 21 of the Act is controlled by Section 19 of the Act. So, in the matter of jurisdiction, Section 19 must prevail and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code regarding the place of suing cannot be resorted to in any matrimonial, proceedings taken under the Hindu Marriage Act. Thus, if, is clear that this Court has no jurisdiction to try the suit."" The Court, however, was aware of the difficult position in which the applicant will be placed on this intarpretation, and referring to that difficulty the learned Judge observed as follows:Hariram Dhalumal Karamchandani vs Jasoti on 15 June, 1962 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1830757/ 2""Perhaps, he would be required to go to Pakistan for seeking any reliefs against the respondent or he would have to live in Nagpur district. Indeed a very unhappy position arises in this case. But the law is to be applied as it stands. Only the legislature which has made it can make provision for such extreme cases. This Court is helpless."" 6. When the matter was taken to the District Court, the learned Assistant Judge who disposed of the appeal upheld the view of the trial Court. He has, however, observed in paragraph 8 of his judgment as follows: ""It is apparent that the provisions of the C. P. Cede may be invoked by a party if there is no express provision regarding jurisdiction or regarding the place of suing under Hindu Marriafie Act. Section 19 makes clear provision regarding place of suing and merely because the petitioner is not entitled to avail himself of it, that does not mean that Section 20, C. P. Code is applicable. It may be that this is rather a hard case; but the question for determination 13 whether the petitioner is entitled to take advantage of Section 20 C. P. Code when the proceeding is governed solely by Section 19 Hindu Marriage Act which overrides the provisions of Section 20 C. P. Code, because Section 21 Hindu Marriage Act lays down that the provisions of the C. P. Code will apply subject to those of Hindu Marriage Act."" 7. The applicant has new come up to this Court and has reiterated the same contentions. It is undoubtedly a somewhat peculiar case. The Hindu Marriage Act was passed by Parliament in 1955 and became the law on 18th May 1955. Under the Act certain rights have been for the first time created in favour of Hindu spouses who are citizens of this country. One of those rights is for husband or wife to obtain a decree for divorce in respect of marriage solemnised even before the commencement of this Act if one or the other of the conditions in Section 13 of the Act are satisfied. The question is whether the enforcement of this right which has been created by the Hindu Marriage Act, can be defeated or denied to a Hindu, who is otherwise entitled to it, by an interpretation put on Section 19 of the Act which makes the remedies available under the Act nugatory so far as Hindus whose marriages were solemnised in a territory which was previously a part of India but is now a part of Pakistan and who have separated before the partition, are concerned. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act are to be interpreted in such a manner, then the only result would be that any person in the position of the applicant and the opponent in the instant case would not he entitled to avail of any of the rights or remedies created in respect of spouses, husbands or wives, under the Act, whether the marriages were solemnised before cr even after the Act. In my opinion, that could not be the intention of the law, and in particular, of the provision regarding jurisdiction of the Court created under Section 19 of the Act. It is in this context that the provisions of Section 21, which make applicable the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, have to be interpreted. It is undoubtedly true that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code have been made applicable subject to the provisions of the Act contained therein. Therefore, the proper way of reconciling the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act with the provision as to the right of suing to be found in the relevant provisions of the Cods of Civil Procedure, and in particular, Section 20 of the Code, would be first to see whether the jurisdiction can be invoked by satisfaction of any of the conditions of Section 19 of the Act. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Act had been called into play, then in that case it is thoseHariram Dhalumal Karamchandani vs Jasoti on 15 June, 1962 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1830757/ 3","['13', '19', '20', '21']"

Chakravarti and S.K. Datta, JJ. composing a Division Bench were divided in their opinion on a point of construction of Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the case was assigned to me for hearing on that point. The point ia stated by their Lordships as follows) ""Whether a wife who got her marriage with her husband annulled by a decree of nullity on the ground of im-potency of the husband under Section 12(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, is entitled to get any maintenance on her application under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. subsequent to the passing of the decree of nullity"". 2. The point arises for decision in this way. On August 1, 1968 a decree of nullity was passed by the learned District Judge of 24-Parganas on a petition under Section 12(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 presented by Sabita Rani Mondal, the opposite party in this Revisional Application, alleging that Sisir Kumar Kundu with whom she was married was impotent at the time of the marriage and continued to be so until the institution of the proceeding. On May 3, 1969 she applied to the Court of the District Judge under Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for an order on the said Sisir Kumar Kundu to pay to her a monthly sum of Rs. 75/-for her maintenance and support Contesting this application Kundu raised a preliminary objection that an application under Section 25(1) was not maintainable after a decree of nullity had been made. This objection was overruled by the court below, Kundu preferred an appeal to this Court from the order and also filed an alternative application in revision. S.K. Chakravarti and S.K. Datta, JJ. before whom the matter came up for hearing held that the appeal was not maintainable but entertained the revi-sional application taking different views on the point stated above. S.K. Chakravarti, J. was of opinion that Section 25 would not apply to a case where a decree of nullity has been passed declaring a marriage as null and void under Section 11 of the Act or where a marriage has been annulled under Section 12 and ""would apply only to Section 13 and Sections 9 and 10"". S.K. Datta. J. on the other hand took the view that ""Section 25 is applicable to all decrees including decrees for nullity of marriages ....."" 3. Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is in these terms : ""Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent"".Sisir Kumar Kundu vs Smt. Sabita Rani Mandal on 26 July, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595195/ 1Section 25(1) thus provides inter alia that either the wife or the husband can apply to the Court at the time when it passes any decree under the Act or subsequently for an order on the other side to pay a gross or periodical sum for the applicant's maintenance and on such an application the Court may make an order as prayed for but an order for payment of a periodical sum can only be for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant and shall be in force only so long as the applicant remains unmarried. We are concerned here with an application made subsequent to the passing of the decree. To find an answer to the question that arises in this case it will be necessary to refer to certain other provisions of the Act which may be done conveniently at this stage. 4. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 lays down the conditions that must be fulfilled before a marriage may be solemnized between two Hindus. Of the six conditions specified in the section. Clause (i) requires that neither party should have a spouse living at the time of marriage, Clause (iv) lays down that the parties must not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two, and Clause (v) enjoins that the parties are not to be sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. Section 9 provides for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights when either the husband or the wife has unreasonably withdrawn from the society of the other. Section 10 provides for a decree for judicial separation on any of the gounds specified in the section. Section 11 states that a marriage ""shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5"". Section 12(1) dealing with voidable marriages provides that a marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity if,-- (a) the respondent was impotent at the time of the marriage and continued to be so until the institution of the proceeding; or (b) the marriage Is in contravention of the condition specified in Clause (ii) of Section 5; or (c) the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitoner is required under Section 5. the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or fraud; or (d) the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner. Clauses (b), (c) and (d) are not relevant for the present purpose. Section 13(1) specifies the grounds upon which a marriage may be dissolved by a decree of divorce. Section 16 provides that children of marriages in respect of which a decree of nullity has been passed under either Section 11 or Section 12 shall be deemed to be legitimate children of the parties to the marriage notwithstanding such decree. 5. The Act thus contemplates five classes of decrees, for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9, for judicial separation under Section 10, for nullity of marriage under Section 11 or Section 12, and for divorce under Section 13. A decree declaring a marriage as null and void under Section 11 is made in a case where the marriage was solemnized in contravention of any of the essential conditions for a Hindu marriage. Such a marriage is automatically void or void ipso jure and is regarded as never having taken place; a decree of nullity passed in such a case only serves to put thatSisir Kumar Kundu vs Smt. Sabita Rani Mandal on 26 July, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595195/ 2fact on record. A voidable marriage may also be annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12. However, the distinction between a void and a voidable marriage is well known. A voidable marriage is valid marriage until annulled, though a decree of nullity passed in such a case purports to put the parties retrospectively to the position as if the marriage had been void from its inception. A voidable marriage however remains valid if not annulled during the lifetime of the parties to it, and cannot be impeached after the death of either of them, 6. Turning now to the point at Issue, Chakravarti, J., seems to have reached his conclusion on the following steps of reasoning. The effect of a voidable marriage being annulled by a decree of nullity is that the marriage Is to be regarded as null and void from its inception. Thus there is no difference between a void marriage and a voidable marriage annulled by a decree of nullity, in both cases the marriage is to be regarded as never having taken place. Section 25(1) entitles only the 'wife' or the 'husband' to apply under the section. If the position after a decree of nullity has been passed is that no marriage had ever taken place between the parties, the relationship of husband and wife cannot be said to have ever subsisted between them; in any event, in case of a voidable marriage the relationship cannot be said to be subsisting after a decree of nullity has been passed. His Lordship finds support for the view taken by him from the difference in language employed in Sections 11 and 12 dealing with void and voidable marriages respectively, and in Section 13 which provides for the dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce. His Lordship points out that Section 13(1) describes the parties who can apply under the section as the 'husband' or the 'wife' whereas this description is absent in Section 11 and Section 12. Chakravarti, J. also refers to a decision of the Guiarat High Court, Mehta Gunavantray v. Bai Prabha, in support of his view. This decision which is of a learned single Judge holds that ""under Section 25 no application for permanent alimony or maintenance can be made subsequent to the passing of the decree for dissolution or annulment of marriage in proceedings for dissolution of marriage by divorce or for annulment of marriage by a decree for nullity"" because ""after the decree the parties cease to be related as husband and wife"". I shall come back to this case later but it may be pointed out here that the decision does not altogether support the view taken by Chakravarti, J. in holding that Section 25 has no application where a decree for divorce under Section 13 has been passed. 7. The reasons given by S.K. Datta. J. in support of his opinion that ""Section 25 is applicable to all decrees which a Court under the Hindu Marriage Act is entitled to pass including decrees of nullity of voidable or void marriages"" may be summarised as follows : (i) Section 25 gives to the Court the power to grant permanent alimony and maintenance at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto. The expression ""any"" has been used in the widest connotation without any limitation and the provisions of the section would, therefore, apply to all the various kinds of decrees permissible under the Act. (ii) As a matter of public policy. In the context, of social condition prevailing in a Hindu society. Section 25 ought to be made applicable to cases where decrees of nullity have been passed. (iii) It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a statute should be given a meaning which is in harmony with its relevant provisions and consistent with the object which it seeks to achieve.Sisir Kumar Kundu vs Smt.

No. 8 of 1988:-- In view of the order passed in C.M.P. 12496 of 1988 this petition is converted into C.M.S.A. and disposed of accordingly. The only substantial question of law that arises in this appeal is whether the permanent alimony can be granted to wife u/S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, even though the main petition for annulment of marriage u/S. 12 of the Act is dismissed. 2. According to the learned counsel for the appellant Mr. M. N. Padmanabhan that U/S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a permanent alimony can be granted only when on the petition filed by either of the spouses u/Ss. 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 of the Act, a decree is passed and not in cases where the petition is dismissed. According to the learned counsel, only in cases where the marriage relationship comes to an end or altered, a permanent alimony can be granted and not in cases where the relationship of the marriage is subsisting and the remedy of the spouse is to proceed under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 for the relief of maintenance and not under the Hindu Marriage Act. In support of his contention, the learned counsel relied on various decisions reported in Shantaram Gopal Shet Narkar v. Hirabai ; Minarani Majumdar v. Dasarath Majumdar, ; Shantaram Dinakar Karnik v. Malti Shantaram Karnik ; Akasam Chinna Basu v. Akasam Parbati (DB); Purshotam v. Devki ; Gurucharan Kuar v. Ramchand ; Darshan Singh v. Mst Daso ; Sushma v. Satishchandra ; and Vinod Chandra Sharma v. Rajesh Pathak . The ratio laid down in the above said decisions is to the effect that in the context of S. 25 of the Act, the expression 'passing any decree' means any of the decrees provided for u/Ss. 9 to 13 of the Act, and not the dismissal of a petition. But although technically speaking dismissal of a suit may be called a decree, such a decree is not contemplated u/S. 25 of the Act. The learned counsel appearing on either side frankly conceded that there is no judgment of this Court on this question. However, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is one decision of this Court u/S. 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, reported in Devasahayam v. Devamony (1923) ILR 46 Mad 133 : (AIR 1923 Mad 211) wherein it was held as follows - ""It is not competent to the Court dismissing a husband's petition for dissolution of marriage, to award maintenance to the wife, u/S. 15 or 37 of the Indian Divorce Act. Though the wife might have filed an application for divorce or judicial separation on the husband's petition u/S. 15 of the Act, still in the absence of a decree for dissolution or judicial separation, no order for maintenance can be made under the Act,"" To appreciate the aforesaid decision, it is worthwhile to quote the provisions of S. 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, which runs thus -Ranganatham vs Shyamala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1138270/ 1""The High Court may, if it thinks fit, on any decree absolute declaring a marriage to be dissolved, or any decree of judicial separation obtained by the wife, and the District Judge may, if he thinks fit, on the confirmation of any decree of his declaring a marriage to be dissolved or any decree of judicial separation obtained by the wife, order that the husband shall, to.the satisfaction of the Court secure to the wife such gross sum of money or such annual sum of money for any term not exceeding her own life, as having regard to her fortune (if any) to the ability of the husband, and to the conduct of the parties, it thinks reasonable; and for that purpose may cause a proper instrument to be executed by all necessary parties. In every such case the court may make an order on the husband for payment to the wife of such monthly or weekly sums for her maintenance and support as the Court may think reasonable."" See. 25 of Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows - ""(1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant, as having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property; of the applicant, the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the Court to be just and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent. (2) If the Court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has made an order under sub-sec. (1) it may at the instance of either party vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just. (3) If the Court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been made under this section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she has not remained chaste, or if such party is the husband, that he has had sexual interecourse with any woman outside wedlock, it may at the instance of the other party vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just."" This S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not identical to S. 37 of the Divorce Act, It is clear from S. 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, that only in a case where the Court on passing any decree absolute declaring a marriage to be dissolved, or any decree of judicial separation obtained by the wife and on its confirmation, make an order on the husband for payment to the wife, the monthly or weekly maintenance. But, this is not the case in so far as S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is concerned. Hence, that section is not at all helpful in deciding the issue involved in this appeal. The very S. 37 itself contemplates passing of a decree, for, dissolution or a judicial separation for granting a permanent alimony to the wife. But S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act contemplates only passing of any decree and it does not further proceed to say a decree for either dissolution or nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights, or judicial separation.Ranganatham vs Shyamala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1138270/ 23. It is clear from the above two provisions that what is contemplated under S. 37 of the Divorce Act, 1869 is materially different from the language used by the Legislature under S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and that the decision rendered in Darshan Singh v. Mst. Daso , cannot afford any guidance in construing the language used by the Legislature in S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. We are now concerned with the words ""at the passing of any decree or at any time consequent thereto with regard to the grant of permanent alimony in favour of the defeated spouse"". In this connection, it is worthwhile to refer to the various decisions relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant. In Akasam Chinna v. Parbati , a Division Bench of the said Court relying on the earlier decisions reported in Harilal Purushotham v. Lilavathi Gokaldas, Shanta-ram Gopalshet v. Hirabai, ; Shantaram Dinakar v. Malti Shantaram Karnik , Minarani v. Dasarath , held that the expression 'any decree' means passing of any of the decrees mentioned in Ss. 9 to 14 of the Act and it does not include an order of dismissal and further the passing of an order of dismissal is not the same thing as passing of a decree and that therefore it cannot be regarded as the passing of a decree and permanent alimony cannot be granted to a party while dismissing the petition under the Act. In the decision reported in Smt. Sushma v. Satish Chandra, a Division Bench of the said Court, while considering the earlier decisions held as follows - ""Hindu Marriage Act (25 of 1955) S. 25 -- Permanent alimony and maintenance -- When can be granted -- Words ""passing any decree"" in S. 25. -- Mean passing of decree of divorce, restitution of conjugal rights or judi cial separation -- Alimony and maintenance cannot therefore be granted as passing of decree dismissing divorce petition. Permanent alimony and maintenance under S. 25 can only by granted in case divorce is granted and not if the marriage subsists. The word 'decree' is used in matrimonial cases in a special sense different from that in which it is used in C.P.C. The passing of the 'decree' in S. 25 means the passing of the decree of divorce, restitution of conjugal rights, or judicial separation and not the passing of a decree dismissing the petition. If the petition fails then no decree is passed, i.e., the decree is denied to the applicant. Alimony, cannot therefore, be granted in a case where a decree for divorce or other decree is refused because in such a case the marriage subsists. The power to grant alimony contained in S. 25 can only be exercised when the court is faced with the problem of setting the mutual rights of the parties after the matrimonial ties have been determined or varied by the passing of the kind of decree mentioned in Ss. 9, 10, 11 and 13 of the Act and not in other cases. Secs. 23 and 27 also show that a decree is passed only when application for divorce or other relief is granted and not when the application is dismissed."" The Division Bench has elaborately dealt with the reasoning in paras 5 to 8 and ultimately came to the conclusion that the word 'decree' in a specific sense is different from that in which it is used in the C.P.C. and that accounted for the reasons which have prompted the reference to the Bench forRanganatham vs Shyamala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1138270/ 3",['25']

Bhattacharjee, J. 1. The appellant-husband petitioned against the wife-respondent in court below for dissolution of the marriage on the ground of her alleged mental disorder and the petition having been dismissed, the husband has preferred this appeal to this Court. But both the parties have now filed a joint-petition before us praying that the marriage between them may be dissolved by a decree of divorce on compromise on the terms and conditions contained therein. The question that has accordingly arisen for our consideration is whether such a course is permissible under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. Under Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, ''all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Civil P.C."", which would accordingly include Order 23, Rule 3 of the Code, providing for compromise of suit. But as indicated in Section 21 itself in its opening words, the Civil P.C. would apply ""subject to the other provisions contained in this Act"", and as provided in Rule 3 of Order 23 of the Code, the Rule would apply only when the Court is satisfied that the ""agreement of compromise"", on the basis of which the proceeding is sought to be decreed, is ""lawful"". We would accordingly have to ascertain as to whether the ""agreement or compromise"" in question is lawful and whether there is anything in the Hindu Marriage Act, express or implied, to outweigh the operation of Rule 3 of Order 23 of the Civil P.C. to a proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act. 3. Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, providing for decree to be awarded thereunder, expressly provides that only when ""any of the grounds for granting relief exists"", obviously meaning thereby any of the grounds specified in the Act, and the other relevant provisions in Cls. (a) to (e) are also satisfied, then only, ""but not otherwise"", the Court can decree the reliefs prayed for. The expression ""but not otherwise"" is weighty enough to indicate with unmistakable clarity that a decree can be granted by the Court only when any of the statutory grounds mentioned in the Act for the grant of relief is found to exist and not merely on the grounds that the parties have agreed to the grant of such a decree. If a special statute governs the grant of relief therein and affirmatively provides that decrees for such reliefs can be granted on those grounds and also negatively provides that decrees can be granted not otherwise, i.e., on no other grounds, then the decree on any ground not provided in the statute would not only be illegal but may amount to a nullity. This is the process of reasoning on which the Supreme Court has held, in a long catena of decisions since 1970 under the Rent Control Acts, that when such Act provides that no decree for eviction can be passed except on one or more of the grounds mentioned therein, a decree passed solely on the basis of compromise without the Court's satisfaction as to the existence of any of such grounds is a nullity. Reference may be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Roshan Lal v. Madan Lal, where all the earlier decisions on the point have been referred to and reviewed and it has been pointed out that even where a landlord and a tenant, in order to avoid protracted litigation or otherwise, agreed to a decree of eviction on compromise, the Court can pass an effective decree of compromise only whenApurba Mohan Ghosh vs Manashi Ghosh on 10 June, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1487189/ 1the Court is satisfied that the compromise indicates, either on its face or in the background of other materials on record, that a statutory ground of eviction has been made out. A later decision of the Supreme Court in Nai Bahu v. Lala Ramnarayan, has also pointed out that while a decree for eviction can be passed on compromise, yet the same may be challenged as a nullity if the records do not indicate that the Court could be satisfied as to the existence of any grounds provided in the relevant law for eviction. Most of these decisions proceeded on the assumption of a public policy involved in relevant Rent Control Acts to give protection to the tenants. 4. Since marriage is an institution around which our civilised society has germinated, the question of public policy involved in the matrimonial law providing for the maintenance as well as dissolution of marriage is no less important than the public policy involved in the Rent Control Laws seeking to provide protection to the tenants. On a parity of reasoning, therefore, it must be held that since the Hindu Marriage Act has in details provided for the grounds for dissolution and has further provided in Section 23(1)(e) that dissolution can be decreed on those grounds, ""but not otherwise"", a decree of divorce on the basis of consent or compromise alone without the satisfaction of the Court as to the existence of any of the statutory grounds would be without jurisdiction. Our view appears to be fully fortified by the observations of the Supreme Court in Reynold Rajamani, to the effect that ""when a legislative provision specifies the grounds on which divorce may be granted, they constitute the only conditions on which the court has jurisdiction to grant divorce"". That was a case under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, Section 10 whereof specifies the grounds of divorce, but there is no express provision anywhere in that Act, analogous to Section 23(1)(e) of the Hindu Marriage Act, providing specifically that a divorce can be granted only on the grounds specified in the Section, but not otherwise. If, even in the absence of such negative prohibitory provisions, the Supreme Court has ruled in Reynold Rajamani (supra) that divorce on any ground not specified in the Act would be without jurisdiction, then the same would a fortiori apply all the more to cases under the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 23(1)(e) whereof contains such categorical prohibition, 5. It is true that by the Amendment Act of 1976, a new Section 13B has been inserted in the Hindu Marriage Act with the marginal note ""Divorce by mutual consent"" and that has given rise to an impression, erroneous though, that the decree of divorce can now be granted on the basis of mutual consent alone. As the provisions of the Section itself would make it clear, a decree under Section 13B cannot be passed in favour of the parties solely on the ground of their mutual consent but on the satisfaction of the Court as to the existence of three conditions, namely, (a) ""that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more"", (b) ""that they have not been able to live together"" and (c) ""that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved"". So even after the introduction of this Section 13B, a compromise decree for divorce on the basis of mutual consent simpliciter would be a decree not on any of the grounds specified in the Act within the meaning of Section 23(1)(a), but one otherwise than on such grounds, which the Court is not empowered to grant under Section 23(1)(a). 6. There are no doubt some observations in the majority judgments in the Full Bench decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Joginder Singh v. Pushpa, which might appear to be authority for the view that a consent decree under the Hindu Marriage Act, even though not in accordance with the provisions thereof, may be illegal but not a nullity and therefore is to be treated as validlyApurba Mohan Ghosh vs Manashi Ghosh on 10 June, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1487189/ 2operative until set aside in due course of law. We are afraid, and this we say with respect, that the attention of the learned Judges were not duly drawn to the provisions of, Section 23(1)(a) and (e), whereunder decrees under the Act are to be passed only on the satisfaction of the Court as to the existence of any of the statutory grounds, ""but not otherwise"" and that in view of the ratio of the decisions of the Supreme Court in Roshan Lal (supra) and in Nai Bahu (supra) and the earlier decisions since 1970 referred to and relied on therein, and more particularly, the observations of the Supreme Court in the context of the Divorce Act, 1869 in Reynold Rajamani (supra), extracted hereinbefore, this view of the Punjab and Haryana High Court is no longer good law. But even going by the Punjab and Haryana view that consent decrees may be ""illega"" but not ""nullities"", no Court should lend its imprimatur to a decree even on compromise which, even though not a nullity, is nevertheless illegal It would be trite to say, as is evident from the provision of Order 23, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that a Court can record a compromise and pass a decree in accordance therewith only when such a compromise is lawful. It is true that this Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana decision in Joginder Singh (supra) has been referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan, . Butallthat has been approved of the Punjab decision by the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani (supra) is the view that ""all cases of consent decrees cannot be said to be collusive"" and ""consent decrees per se in matrimonial matters are not collusive"". We have not propunded any contrary view hereinbefore, but have only tried to point out that a divorce-decree merely on the basis of mutual consent or compromise without any material on the record on the basis of which the Court could be satisfied as to the existence of any statutory ground for divorce would be without jurisdiction and a nullity and we have found the Supreme Court decisions in Roshan Lal (supra) and in Nai Bahu (supra) and the series of earlier decisions referred to and relied on therein, and particularly the observations of the Supreme Court in Reynold Rajamani (supra) to be clear authorities for this proposition and we would only add that the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani (supra) has laid down nothing to the contrary and has not in fact considered the question arising before us even remotely. 7. In the case at hand, therefore, before decreeing divorce on compromise, we must find some material on the record, whether in the pleadings, evidence or otherwise, which can be a ground of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, for otherwise according to our reading of the relevant provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and Order 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the series of decisions of the Supreme Court in Roshan Lal (supra) and Nai Bahu (supra) and the other earlier decisions referred to and relied on therein and the observations in Reynold Rajamani (supra), a decree of divorce solely on the basis of compromise, without any advertence as to the existence of any of the permissible grounds is not permissible under the Law. As we have already indicated, even a decree for divorce under the newly added Section 13B, labelled as ""Divorce by mutual consent"", cannot be granted by the Court on mutual consent alone, without being satisfied that the parties are living, and could not but live separately for one year or more and things have come to such a pass that they cannot cohabit together. 8. There appears to be authorities, quite a number, for the view that even where a divorce proceeding on one or more of the grounds specified in Statute has been hotly contested in the trial Court and has been dismissed, the parties, in the appeal therefrom, may for the first time apply before the Appellate Court for ""divorce by mutual consent"" under Section 13B and may be grantedApurba Mohan Ghosh vs Manashi Ghosh on 10 June, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1487189/ 3","['23', '10', '13', '21']"

The short question that arises for determination in this appeal, under the Hindu Marriage Act, is whether the appellant is entitled to exclude the time taken to obtain a certified copy of the decree of the lower court, for filing the appeal? Can Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act be invoked by the appellant? 2. The appellant is the wife who married the respondent in 1972. They have a daughter born on 30-5-1973. In 1979, the husband filed a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of the marriage on the grounds of desertion and cruelty. A decree for divorce was granted by the lower court on 25-1-1980. The appellant applied for a copy on 30-1-1980. He received the copy on 29-3-1980 and filed this appeal on 8-4-1980. The appeal has been filed beyond thirty days of the date of the decree; but is within time if time taken to obtain the certified copy is deducted. Is this appeal within time or out of time? 3. The learned counsel for the husband-respondent, Shri T. V. Ramakrishnan, submits that the appeal is barred by time. He contends that the Limitation Act does not apply in view of Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act and adds that if the time for filing an appeal has expired without any appeal having been presented, it was lawful for the husband to marry again and if the statute permits him to marry under these circumstances, it could not be a date varying from case to case but a date which is definite, exact and precise. He brings to our notice that the husband has in fact remarried on 5-4-1980 and he has a child through her. Shri K. P. Sreekumar, counsel for the appellant, submits that Section 12 of the Limitation Act applies and that the appeal has been filed within time. 4. Decree of divorce is appealable under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act as decrees of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction and every such appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decision of the court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Section 28 (4) prescribes the period of limitation. It provides : -- ""Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order"". 5. Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act is pressed into service for contending that the Limitation Act is wholly inapplicable to proceedings with respect to marriage and divorce. It is necessary therefore to extract Section 29(2) and (3) of the Limitation Act. ""29. Savings.-- (1) XXX (2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the schedule, theKunnarath Yesoda vs Manathanath Narayanan on 14 June, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/853673/ 1provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. (3) Save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any such law"". 6. There is no doubt and no dispute either that the Hindu Marriage Act is a special law. The special law has not expressly excluded Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act. Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act therefore makes Sections 4 to 24, of that Act applicable to the Hindu Marriage Act. 7. The next question is whether Section 29(2) itself is excluded in view of Section 29(3). While interpreting the two clauses of the same section, it is a salutary principle of statutory interpretation that the attempt should be to give a harmonious construction keeping in view, both the legislative intent, and the statutory content so that there is mutual coexistence and meaningful relevance for both the clauses. 8. Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act, excludes the application of the Limitation Act itself to any suit or other proceeding under any law with respect to marriage and divorce unless it is otherwise provided by that law. If the law with respect to marriage and divorce, expressly or by necessary implication, provides for the application of the Limitation Act, Section 29(3) expressly saves those provisions. The first question to be decided therefore is whether the Hindu Marriage Act itself provides by necessary implication, if not expressly, that the Limitation Act would apply to appeals filed under that Act. 9. The exclusion under Section 29(3) is in respect of a suit or other proceeding under the law with respect to marriage and divorce -- the Hindu Marrige Act. Is an appeal under the Hindu Marriage Act, ""other proceeding"" within the meaning of Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act? This is the second question to be considered. Balagangadharan Nair, J. in the decision in Kuttimalu v. Subramonian, 1981 Ker LT 602 : (AIR 1981 NOC 221) has taken the view :-- ""On the terms of Sub-section (3) of the 1963 Act and in the nature of the case what is excluded is suits and other proceedings of an original nature like a petition for relief under the Marriage and Divorce Laws. Although the expression 'proceedings' is somewhat elastic and might in certain contexts include an appeal, here it is linked with the expression 'suit' and they should therefore be understood in their cognate sense, the word 'proceeding' being restricted to a sense analogous to that of a suit"". The learned Judge followed Chander Dev v. Rani Bala, AIR 1979 Delhi 22 in which it was stated thus (para 13) :-- ""The Limitation Act, 1963 is in-applicable to original proceedings. But appeals from decrees in suits under the Indian Divorce Act and appeals from decrees and orders under the Hindu Marriage ActKunnarath Yesoda vs Manathanath Narayanan on 14 June, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/853673/ 2are not excluded from the operation of the Indian Limitation Act. XXXXX The prohibition contained in Section 29(3), Limitation Act, 1963 is restricted only to suits and proceedings and hence does not extend to appeals,"" 10. It is this preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the appeal that gave rise to the reference to the Full Bench. The relevant portion of the reference order is extracted below : -- The reason for excluding suits under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 from the operation of the Limitation Act, is obvious and that is, the policy of law is such that it cannot and does not allow suits like one for restitution of conjugal rights, for judicial separation, for divorce etc. to gel barred by providing that such suits shall be filed within any particular time limit prescribed in that behalf. The same policy of law governs and ought to govern any such proceeding similar to suits under any law relating to marriage and divorce, be it that such proceeding is registered as a suit or not, and that is the basis of the Law Commission's recommendation. Thus there can be no doubt that the original proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in the court of first instance are within the ambit of Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act, 1963. Are appeals arising therefrom within the scope of that section? It is contended on behalf of the appellant that so far as appeals arising therefrom, i.e. from suits and other like proceedings, are concerned there is no reason to extend the said policy of law to such appeals. The submission is that after the adjudication by the first court, parties know where they stand and can decide whether the matter should be taken up in appeal or not; and, moreover, in cases where a decree of divorce or a decree of nullity of marriage has been granted, a finality is to be given to them, so that parties may be certain about the next step they may be intending to take like entering into another marriage. So law fixed a time limit within which the decree may be appealed against, and, where the marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce, provides, as is done by Section 15 of the H.M. Act, that till the appeal time is over without an appeal having been preferred, or if an appeal has been presented within time, till it is dismissed, it shall not be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again. He referred to Section 57 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, which according to him, is also based on this principle. The submission in short on behalf of the appellant is that the word ""proceeding"" in Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act, 1963 is to be given a restricted meaning. It is argued that that word should be understood as a judicial proceeding analogous to or in the nature of a suit. In that connection the learned counsel lays emphasis on the fact that the word ""proceeding"" occurs in that provision in conjunction with the word ""suit"" -- ""suit or other proceeding."" The contention on the side of the respondent is that unless a definite and specified period starting from the date of the decision is prescribed for preferring an appeal and that unless time for preferring appeal is reckoned without excluding any portion of such period on any account, Section 15 would be of no use and avail. According to the learned counsel Section 15 allows a party to a marriage when marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce to marry again after the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented and where an appeal has been presented, after the dismissal thereof. According to the respondent's counsel it is for this reason that Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act, 1963 provides that the provisions in that Act shall not apply to any suit or other proceeding under any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce.Kunnarath Yesoda vs Manathanath Narayanan on 14 June, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/853673/ 3","['15', '3', '13', '12', '28','29']"

Rajendra Choudhury and Veena Devi, for the appellant. R. Vasudev Pillai and P. Kesava Pillai, for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA, J.--This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated July 22, 1969 of the High Court of Judicature, Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in connection with a petition filed by respondent Dr. G. G. Padma Rao against the appellant Swarajya Lakshmi under, Sec. 13(1)(iv) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for the dissolution of the marriage between them by a decree of divorce on the ground that the appellant had for a period of not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition been suffering from a virulent and incurable form of leprosy. The appellant and the respondent were married on June 17, 1963. The appellant was then 20 and the respondent, her husband, was 28 years of age. The appellant, we are told, was taken away by her parents of New Delhi only two, days after the, marriage she returned to Hyderabad to live with her husband only towards the end of August 1963. Almost immediately thereafter in the month of September her 'husband discovered that she was suffering both from Leporsy and Tuberculosis. He being a 'doctor started treating the wife immediately. Not content with his own treatment he consulted also two experts namely Dr. C. V. Ethirajuju and Dr. Shanti Narayan Mathur. At one point of time the respondent seriously contemplated admitting the appellant to a leper home, but the appellant was taken away by her father to New Delhi in May 1964 as she was then expecting a child, On June 4, 1965 the respondent filed a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the said Act) for, dissolution of his marriage with the appellant. At the time of Presenting this petition he made an application under Sec. 14(1) of the said Act before the City Civil Court at Hyderabad for permisSion to present the petition before three years had elapsed from the date of the marriage on the ground that the case was one of exceptional hardship to the respondent. The permission was granted and the petition was thereafter beard on evidence. On February 22, 1966 the, Second Additional. Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad who heard the Petition passed an order by which he held (a) that Swarajya Lakshmi, the appellant, had been suffering from an incurable and virulent form of leprosy for a period not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition but (b) that the petition was, premature on the ground that the parties to the petition had not been husband and wife for a period of three years. The learned Second Additional Chief Judge dismissed the petition on these findings. The respondent thereupon went on appeal to the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. A Division Bench beard that appeal. By an order dated July 22, 1969 the Division Bench allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the court below and granted a decree for divorce in favour of the respondent under Sec. 13 (1) (iv) of the said Act. From this judgment, appellant Swarajya Lakshmi has now come by special leave on appeal to this Court. The main controversy between the parties before us turned round the question : Was the prosy of Swarajya Lakshmi of an incurable and virulent form ?

The question arising in this revision petition is whether a suit brought by a person claiming to be the wife of the defendant for an injunction restraining the defendant from contracting a second marriage is cognisable by a civil court. 2. The material facts are these: In the court of the Munsiff of Gulbarga, the plaintiff claiming to be the wife of the defendant instituted a suit on May 6, 1961 and the prayer portion of the plaint reads as follows: ""Hence it is prayed that the plaintiff's suit be decreed against the defendant with cost as follows: 1. That the defendant be perpetually restrained from marrying one Sitamma D/o Gundappa R/o of Pada Taluk Gulbarga or any other girl or woman; 2. Any other relief which the court deems fit be awarded."" In para 1 of her plaint it was stated that the plaintiff was married to the defendant 12 years before the date of the institution of the suit and that she was the second wife of the defendant. In para 3 of the plaint she complained of ill-treatment on the part of the husband. In paras 4 and 5 it was stated that the defendant had been instigated to take a third wife and that since such marriage would amount to bigamy, the plaintiff had a right to ask for an injunction restraining the defendant from contracting that marriage. The prayer, as can be seen from the portion extracted from the plaint, was that the court should issue an injunction restraining the defendant from contracting any such marriage. 3. In the written statement produced by the defendant, it was pleaded that about 7 years before the institution of the suit the plaintiff had been divorced and that such divorce was permissible by a custom in his community. He also pleaded that the only remedy available to the plaintiff was to seek a declaration under the provisions of The Hindu Marriage Act after the proposed marriage was solemnized, that the marriage between the defendant and the woman whom he proposed to marry was a void marriage, and that the suit brought by the plaintiff in the civil court was not maintainable. The court below tried the issue relating to jurisdiction as a preliminary issue and found no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the objection to jurisdiction was groundless. The petitioner contests the correctness of this conclusion reached by that Court. 4. It is true as contended by Mr. Kulkarni, the learned Advocate for the defendant, that the Hindu Marriage Act is a complete and exhaustive Code on all the matters regulated by it. That law is a law to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus. Section 4 states the overriding effect of the Act and provides that all texts, rules or interpretation of Hindu law and all customs orShankarappa vs Basamma on 12 June, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61796/ 1usages as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter, for which provision is made in the Act. It further provides that every other law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in the Act. Section 29 however which is in the nature of an exception to the provisions of Section 4 declares that a marriage solemnized between Hindus before the commencement of the Act, which is otherwise valid, shall not be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid by reason only of the fact that the parties thereto belong to the same gotra or pravara or belonged to different religions, castes or sub-divisions of the same caste. It again provides that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect any right recognised by custom or conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of the Act. There are (other?) similar provisions in that section to which it would be unnecessary to make any reference in the course of this order. The next section to which reference should be made is Section 19 which provides that every petition under the Act shall be presented to the District Court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnized or the husband and wife reside or last resided together. It is clear from the provisions of these three sections of the Act and particularly from the provisions of Section 4 that the only statutory provisions which cease to have effect after the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act are those which relate to matters for which provision is made in the Hindu Marriage Act or which are inconsistent with any such provisions. Section 29 is in the nature of an exception to what is contained in Section 4, and what is clear from Section 19 is that the only jurisdiction which is created by that section is the jurisdiction conferred by that section in regard to petitions which may be presented under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. Now one important provision which was made by the Hindu Marriage Act which has relevance to the present case is that contained in Section 5(i) of the Act which reads: 5. ""Conditions of a Hindu marriage - A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely,- (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; ....."" Section 11 declares that any marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any of the conditions specified in Clause (i) (iv) and (v) of Section 5. Section 17 of the Act declares that any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of the Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a living spouse, and that such person who contracts such marriage renders himself liable to punishment under Sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Cede.Shankarappa vs Basamma on 12 June, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61796/ 26. What made it possible for the plaintiff to institute the suit in the present case is the introduction of the system of monogamy by Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 11 which declares that a bigamous marriage is a void marriage. 7. The short question arising in this case is whether the plaintiff could not bring her suit when she discovered, according to her allegation, her husband embarking upon an act of bigamy, to restrain him from transgressing the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act by committing an offence punishable under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code. 8. Before proceeding to consider this question, I must place on record my expression of thanks to Mr. M.A. Gopalaswamy lyengar who has assisted me with his argument in this case since unfortunately no one on behalf of the respondent was present to afford any such assistance. Mr. Gopalaswamy lyengar urged that this is a case in which no one could say that the civil court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit like the one brought by the plaintiff since that suit is one clearly permitted by the provisions of Section 54 of the Specific Relief Act under the provisions of which the plaintiff could ask for a perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from committing a breach of an obligation existing in her favour. 9. The answer to this argument supplied by Mr. Kulkarni was that the Hindu Marriage Act being an exhaustive code regulating all matters arising out of a marriage between two Hindus, the only course which was open to the plaintiff in this case was to wait until the defendant had committed an act of bigamy and then to make an application for a declaration that the marriage was void or to prosecute the defendant for an offence punishable under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code. It was also submitted that in effect the plaintiff's suit was a suit for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights for which provision has indeed been made by Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which excludes the jurisdiction of a civil Court in regard to that matter. 10. The argument that the plaintiff's suit is one for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights may be briefly disposed of. Nowhere in the plaint has Mr. Kulkarni been able to point out any reference to any restitution of conjugal rights, nor does the plaint contain any prayer for any such restitution. The prayer portion of the plaint which has been, extracted makes it clear that the only prayer made by the plaintiff was a prayer for a perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from committing an act of bigamy. In that view of the matter, Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not what can exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court. 11. Now turning to the question whether the perpetual injunction sought by the plaintiff could not be granted by the court below in a suit brought for that purpose, it should be pointed out that the suit brought by the plaintiff for that injunction was one which clearly fell within Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure under the provisions of which every civil court can exercise jurisdiction in all suits of a civil nature except in suits whose cognizance is expressly or impliedly barred. That the suit brought by the plaintiff is a suit of a civil nature is what is perfectly plain. The question therefore which remains is whether its cognizance is expressly or impliedly barred. Mr. Kulkarni had to admit that the Hindu Marriage Act does not expressly bar the institution of a suit like the oneShankarappa vs Basamma on 12 June, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61796/ 3","['17', '4', '19', '5', '9', '29', '11']"

The instant appeal has been preferred by the appellant wife against the judgment and decree dated 12.9.1989 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 14th Court, Alipore thereby dismissing her Matrimonial suit No. 39 of 1992 wherein she prayed for a decree of divorce against the husband respondent under the provisions of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act on grounds of cruelty, both mental and physical and desertion. The husband respondent contested the above suit in the Trial Court denying all the material allegation contained in the petition for divorce and his specific case was that the appellant wife sometime after her marriage developed illicit and adulterous relationship with one Sibapada Banerjee the husband of the respondent's elder sister which became a public scandal injuring the social position of the respondent and the members of his family but the petitioner wife i.e. the present appellant did not mend her ways and on her own consent the respondent took him to her father's Jpise at Baranagar on 26th August, 1979 for spending a few days there. Since then the petitioner has not come back to her matrimonial home. According to the appellant she was neglected in her matrimonial home since her marriage where she had to perform only the household duties and that the inmates of the house never treated her well with dignity and even her own brother was not allowed to enter into the house when he came Jo see her at one occasion. 2. It is the case of the appellant by way of subsequent amendment of the plaint that on 25.8.1979 she was mercilessly assaulted by the husband who drove her out of his house for which she had to leave her matrimonial home with her daughter in single clothing leaving everything behind. It is the case of wife that the husband respondent and his family members had challenged her chastity, undermined her status, forcing her to cook and attend the household duties only and she was never allowed to participate in any family discussion or gathering. It is her case that she was even compelled to entertain the clients of her husband who happened to be a business man. She was even accused by the husband and his family members that her parents used to come not to see her but to collect money which she had stolen from her husband to help her parents. When she protested she was maltreated, abused and assaulted with blows and slaps given by the husband. Another objection was taken before the Trial Court by the husband respondent that the matrimonial suit was not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act as their marriage was solemnised and registered under Special Marriage Act. It is to be considered by us whether the learned Trial Judge has rightly dismissed the petitioner's suit for divorce filed under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. 3. At the outset it may be pointed out that the husband/respondent after the appeal was heard in part appeared and prayed for permission to contest the appeal which was allowed by us by our order dated 26.2.1996. It is also interesting to note that on 4.3.1996 the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent that Mr. Chowdhury learned Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted thatNandita Roy (Nee Ghosh) vs Asish Kumar Roy on 2 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1829370/ 1his client did not want to contest the appeal and as such Mr. Chowdhury sought for our permission to retire. In support of his submission Mr. Chowdhury filed a letter dated 3.3.1996 written by the husband respondent to him stating that he was not required to represent him before the Court at the time of hearing of the appeal and that he did not want to contest the same. Under the circumstances Mr. Chowdhury was permitted to retire and the appeal was ultimately heard ex parte. 4. The learned trial Judge on consideration of the evidence on record has come to a finding that the suit is not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is his finding that the marriage was solemnised and registered under the provisions of the. Special Marriage Act and as such the suit was not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. Although the learned trial Judge has found the suit to be not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, he has decided the suit on merit and has dismissed the same on consideration of the other issues relating to cruelty, desertion and adultery. Coming to his finding regarding the maintainability of the suit under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act we are of opinion that the said finding is erroneous and not sustainable in law in view of the cogent evidence on record. Admittedly the marriage was solemnised between the parties on 28.5.1970 at 7 a.m. in the paternal house of the appellant at Baranagar in the evening. Admittedly both the appellant and the respondent belong to Brahmo Sect. Under Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act the said Act applies inter alia to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms of development, including a Virashaiva, a Linguyait or a follower of the Brahmo, Parthana or Aryasamaj. Under Section 2(3) of the said Act the expression 'Hindu' in any portion of the Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in the section. It would also be relevant at this point to refer to the Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) regarding the ceremonies for Hindu Marriage which is quoted below : ""Ceremonies for a Hindu Marriage-(1) A Hindu Marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto. (2) Where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi (that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken."" 5. It is clear that the Act applies to the followers of Brahmo Samaj who may not be practising all the formalities of Hindu religion and in whose marriage ritual ceremonies including Saptapadi as practised in other forms of Hindu marriage are not necessary to make the marriage complete and legal. It is the case of the appellant that the marriage between the parties was solemnised under Brahmo rites and it was only registered under Special Marriage Act on the same day after the marriage in Brahmo form was complete. It is her categorical evidence that all the ceremonies associated with Brahmo marriage, such as prayer by Acharya, devotional songs, exchange of garlands and rings and putting of vermillion mark on the forehead of the bride all took place with due solemnity, in presence of all the family members of both the parties. It is her evidence that one Nanibhusan Das gupta presided over the marriage as Acharya who has since died. It is also her evidence that she signed all the papers in respect of the registration of the marriage under thatNandita Roy (Nee Ghosh) vs Asish Kumar Roy on 2 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1829370/ 2Special Marriage Act after the Brahmo ceremonial marriage was over. D.W. 1 is the respondent husband. He states in his chief that after the Brahmo ceremony both he and the appellant signed the register before the Marriage Registrar and that their witnesses also signed. In cross- examination the husband has admitted that for the Brahmo ceremony marriage both the parties had mutual consent and that at the time of Brahmo ceremony marriage the parents of the both the parties were present. It is also gathered from the evidence that the Marriage Registrar under the Special Marriage Act was one Prasad Roy who is the brother of the husband/respondent. 6. The said Prasad Roy has not however, been examined by the husband/ respondent, Ext. C is the certificate of marriage issued under Section 13 of the Special Marriage Act dated 28.5.1970 and there are three witnesses. But none of them has been examined by the respondent to show that the marriage registered under Ext. C was solemnised under the provisions of the said Act and not under Brahmo rites. The learned trial Judge has disbelieved the story of Brahmo ceremonial marriage between the parties on the ground that the petitioner has not been corroborated by any other witness. But it appears that the appellant has examined one Prasanta Kumar Bhattacharjee P.W. 3 who is a co-tenant in the premises where the father and other family members of the petitioner resided at Baranagar. It is his evidence that he was a witness to the marriage between the parties which was solemnised there according to Brahmo custom. He further says that the ceremonial marriage was held prior to registration and that the marriage took place on 28.5.1970. There is no reason to disbelieve this witness and the learned trial Judge has unduly ignored the above evidence on record. There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the appellant and his witness P.W. 3 in this regard. Accordingly we hold that the marriage between the parties were held and solemnised in Brahmo form on 28.5.1970 as alleged by the appellant. Such a marriage could be registered under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act. But Ext. C purports to suggest that the marriage was solemnised and registered under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. There cannot be two valid marriages between the same parties. It is clear from the evidence on record that the marriage between the parties was solemnised for the first time under Brahmo form. In that view of the matter the marriage certificate given under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act is redundant and should be ignored. If at all it is to be relied upon it should be treated as registration of the Brahmo marriage under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act. Accordingly we hold that the appellants matrimonial suit brought against the husband/respondent for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is quite maintainable in form and in law. 7. Now we come to the merits of the case. The appellant has brought the suit for dissolution of her marriage by decree of divorce on ground of cruelty both mental and physical inflicted by the husband upon her and also on ground of desertion stating that she was driven out from her matrimonial home after being assaulted on 25.8.1979. On subsequent amendment of the plaint, it has been further stated by the petitioner that the husband alongwith the family members challenged her chastity and drove her out of matrimonial home on 25.8.1979. The instances of cruelty as given in the plaint have already been referred to us in the foregoing paragraphs of our judgment. The husband in his written statement and in his additional written statement has denied the entire story of cruelty and desertion. On the other hand in his written statement he has categorical, stated that his wife has undue, illicit and adulterous relationship with his brother-in-law one Sibapada Banerjee. It is his categorical case that the appellant's adulterous relationship with him became aNandita Roy (Nee Ghosh) vs Asish Kumar Roy on 2 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1829370/ 3","['13', '15', '7', '2']"
264,"Madras High Court Manoj Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Equivalent citations: (1991) 290 MLJ 1 Author: Ratnam ORDER Ratnam, J. 1. This civil revision petition, at the instance of the wife, is directed against the order of the Court below dismissing the application filed by her in I.A. No. 80 of 1987 in H.M.O.P. No. 171 of 1986, under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, praying that the respondent should be directed to pay the petitioner maintenance in a sum of Rs. 200 every month and Rs. 750 to meet the expenses of that proceeding. 2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the civil revision petition, are as follows: On 17.9.1977, the respondent herein married the petitioner at Salem and the petitioner gave birth to a daughter. The petitioner and the respondent lived together as wife and husband till 22.8.1984. Misunderstandings appear to have arisen between the parties, which ultimately led to the petitioner being obliged to leave for her parents' house. On 15.7.1985, the petitioner issued a notice to the respondent, setting out the circumstances, under which she was obliged to leave the house of the respondent and demanding payment of maintenance by the respondent and other expenses, to which, on 23.7.1985, the-respondent replied, requiring the petitioner to come and live with him. To this, on 29.7.1985, the petitioner sent a rejoinder and subsequently, the petitioner filed M.C.No.9 of 1985 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, under Section 125, Code of Criminal Procedure, praying for the award of maintenance to her. In that application, the petitioner stated that the respondent was addicted to drinks and had also developed illicit intimacy with another woman and that she was beaten and driven out of the house by the respondent, justifying her living separately from the respondent and claiming maintenance. That application was resisted by the respondent disputing the grounds alleged by the petitioner. However on 31.3.1986, in M.C. No. 9 of 1985, the Chief Judicial Magistrate found that the petitioner had established the grounds set out by her in that petition and also found that the petitioner was obliged to leave the respondent for a just cause and that the respondent should pay the petitioner maintenance at the rate of Rs. 250 per mensem from 31.3.1986 onwards, having regard to the income of the respondent. In Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986, the respondent questioned the correctness of that order, but by order dated 30.1.1990, this Court confirmed the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, in M.C. No. 9 of 1985 and dismissed Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986. It is not now in dispute and it is also indeed the finding of the court below in the present proceedings, that the respondent had not paid the maintenance amount to the petitioner, as ordered in M.C. No. 9 of 1985 and confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986. While matters stood thus, the respondent, some time in November, 1986, instituted K.M.O.P. No. 171 of 1986, Sub Court, Salem under Section 13(1)(i)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, praying for the passing of a decree for divorce annulling the marriage between the respondent and the petitioner on the ground that the petitioner had voluntarily and wilfully withdrawn from the company of the respondent, without any valid or reasonable cause, for a period of two years from 23.8.1984. That proceeding is being contested by the petitioner on ground, which need not be noticed for purpose of the present civil revision petition. In I.A. No. 80 of 1987 in R.M.O.P. No. 171 of 1986, filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the petitioner prayed for a direction toManoj Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/266113/ 1the respondent to pay her Rs. 200 every month towards maintenance and Rs. 750 to meet the expenses of the litigation launched by the respondent. Amongst others, an objection was raised by the respondent that having regard to the prior proceeding under Section 125, Crl. P.C in M.C. No. 9 of 1985, on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986, the petitioner was not entitled to make a claim against the respondent for maintenance and that the petition deserved dismissal, as the petitioner was not entitled to any relief. The learned Subordinate Judge, Salem found that the respondent had not paid to the petitioner the maintenance amount awarded in M.C. No. 9 of 1985, as confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986, but that, in view of the decision in Mamta Rani v. Raj Kumar (1985) 1 M.C. 141, the petitioner can not seek payment of maintenance from the respondent for a second time in view of the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. However, the court directed the respondent to pay the petitioner Rs. 300 towards litigation expenses. It is the correctness of this order insofar as it is against the petitioner that is challenged in this civil revision petition. 3 Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended relying upon the conclusion arrived at by the court below that the respondent had not paid the maintenance amounts to the petitioner as per the order passed in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. that the view taken by the Court below that the petitioner is not entitled to claim maintenance even in proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, owing to the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. is erroneous, It was also further pointed out that the decision relied on by the court below in Mamta Rani v. Raj Kumar (1985) 1 M.C. 141 did not have any application at all. Attention was also drawn by learned Counsel in this connection to the decisions reported in Surjit Kaur v. Tinath Singh A.I.R. 1978 P. and H. 112, Ramesh Chander v. Veena Kaushal , Ganapathy v. Rajalakshmi 1982 T.L.N.J. 426 and Sri Ramachandra Murthy v. Satya Satyamani (1984) 1 M.C. 406 (A.P.). On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner having already succeeded in obtaining an order for payment of maintenance from the respondent in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. cannot be permitted again to recover maintenance under Section 24. Hindu Marriage Act, and strongly relied upon the decisions in Mamta Rani v. Raj Kumar (1985) 1 M.C. 141 and Sudarshan Kumar v. Deepak 1985 Crl L.J. (Noc.) 52 (P. and H.). 4. Whatever previously might have been the right of the wife to claim maintenance as an incident of the status of matrimony on the establishment of the relationship of wife and husband, now, under Section l8(1) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, which came into operation on 21.12.1956, a Hindu wife whether married before or after the commencement of that Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime, Section 18(2) of that Act enumerates the circumstances, under which, a Hindu wife is entitled to live separately from her husband, without forfeiting her claim to maintenance. Thus, the right of the wife to claim maintenance from the husband, even in those cases falling tinder Section l8(2) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, when she is obliged to live separately from her husband, is a statutory one. The method and manner of enforcing this right, would necessarily depend upon the circumstances obtaining in any particular case. It may be that in a given case, the wife may resort to proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. in the hope and with the expectation that she would get quicker and speedier relief in those proceedings. Equally, it may well be that a wife may resort to proceedings before a Civil Court for the enforcement of such right. These however may at best be characterisedManoj Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/266113/ 2as the adoption of different methods for the enforcement of the right to maintenance. It is necessary in this connection to remember that the right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is in the nature of a special right, arising on initiation and during the pendency of the proceedings by one or the other of the parties to the marriage, under the provisions of that Act. Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the pendency of proceedings under that Act, is an essential condition for the exercise of the right either by the wife or the husband, as the case may be, to seek an order for payment of the expenses of the proceeding and a monthly sum sufficient for his or her support. It is thus clear that the right to claim maintenance or litigation expenses under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is not made available generally to the parties to a marriage, but only when a proceeding between the spouses is pending under that Act, and in that respect, the right conferred under Section 24 of that Act, is in the nature of a special statutory right not in any manner outside the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The purpose behind Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is that parties to a matrimonial cause should not take undue and unfair advantage of a superior financial capacity to defeat the rightful claims of a weaker party and the proceedings under Section 24 of that Act serve a limited purpose, i.e., during the pendency of proceedings under that Act, to enable the weaker party to establish rights without being in any manner hindered by lack of financial support. If the special nature of the statutory right under Section 24 of that Act and its purpose, are borne in mind, it is at once clear that the enforcement of that right, cannot in any manner be hedged in by a consideration of proceedings otherwise initiated, either under Section 125, Cr. P.C. or under the ordinary law. Further more, in this case, the finding recorded by the court below is to the effect that the respondent had not paid to the petitioner even the amounts of maintenance awarded in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. and there can, therefore, be absolutely no justification whatever for declining to countenance the claim of the petitioner for maintenance on the ground of the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. It may also be pointed out that in proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. the power of the Magistrate is limited to an award of monthly maintenance not exceeding Rs. 500 in the whole, and under Section 127(2) and (4), Cr. P.C. provision is made for the cancellation or variation of the magisterial order, as a consequence of a decision of acompetent civil court and for the civil court to take into account the amount paid to or recovered by a person, pursuant to an order under Section 125, Cr. P.C. The aforesaid provisions do not in any manner impinge upon the specifical statutory right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Upon the parties to a proceeding under the provisions of that Act. It would, therefore, follow that the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C, cannot be put against the petitioner, as a ground for declining to entertain her claim for maintenance in enforcement of her statutory right under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. It would be appropriate at this stage to refer to the decisions relied on by learned Counsel for the petitioner. In Surjit Kaur v. Tinath Singh A.I.R. 1978 P. and H. 112, interpreting Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and considering the question whether proceedings under Section 488 of the old Cr. P.C. corresponding to Section 125, Cr. P.C. would have any impact upon the right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, it was held that a mere pre-existing order under the Criminal Procedure Code for payment of maintenance, does not oust the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to allow maintenance pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In so holding, reference was made to Harbans Lal v. Ganga Devi 1975 Chand. L.R. 250, where, the prayer to stay proceedings under Section 125, Cr. P.C. on the ground that pendente lite maintenance hadManoj Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/266113/ 3","['18', '13', '24', '12']"

This letters patent appeal preferred by the wife is directed against the decree passed by the learned single Judge, whereunder dismissing her first appeal filed under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the decree of the trial Court allowing the counter-claim of the husband/defendant for dissolution of marriage of the appellant and dismissing her suit for Judicial separation and for recovery of some of the articles but accepting her claim for the grant of maintenance subject to certain conditions, was upheld. 2. In the present appeal, the appellant has prayed for the allowing of the appeal and setting aside of the decree passed by the learned single Judge confirming the judgment and decree of the trial Court and has prayed for a decree for judicial separation. 3. However, during the pendency of the appeal, the appellant filed an application being I.A. No. 5858/99 on 26-7-1999, wherein she has prayed that the words ""and decree for judicial separation may kindly be passed in favour of the appellant"" be deleted. With the deletion of the aforesaid words, the only relief claimed in this appeal will remain for setting aside of the judgment and decree passed by the learned single Judge confirming the Judgment and decree of the trial Court with costs. 4. This appeal is therefore treated to be so confined in its scope. 5. We have heard Shri Dhartipakad Madanlal Agrawal, the brother of the appellant-wife, in support of this appeal in her presence. She has executed the power of attorney in his favour authorising him to present her case and make the submissions in support of the appeal on her behalf. We have also heard the learned counsel representing the respondent-husband and have carefully perused the record. 6. The facts In brief shorn of details and necessary for the disposal of this appeal lie in a narrow compass : The appellant-wife had filed an application under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act on 21-3-1991 registered as the suit giving rise to this appeal praying for a decree of Judicial separation and return of the articles detailed in the Schedule-A attached to the application along with rash and further praying for a direction requiring the defendant-respondent to pay her an amount of Rs. 1000/- per month for her maintenance. 7. In the aforesaid application, the appellant had challenged that she had been married with the defendant-husband on 28-4-1986 in accordance with the Hindu religion. She had asserted that her husband, the defendant, and the members of his family continuously harassed her on account of dowry and the husband as well as the members of his family tortured her both physically andSmt.

A daughter was born to her out of their wedlock on 28-4-1990 but the husband and his father and mother did not allow the new born baby to sleep with her and the said new born daughter died on 12-12-1990, when she was with the sister-in-law of the defendant. It was claimed that apparently the husband had treated her with mental cruelty. She also alleged that the defendant and his family members did not permit her to use or utilise the goods/ articles she had received in dowry. The father of the husband/defendant used to call her to massage his feet in the night and on her refusal used to torture her in various ways. She further asserted that after the death of her daughter when her brother tried to meet her, he was not permitted. In the end, he moved an application before the Court and initiated judicial proceedings and saved her life. She had prayed for a decree of judicial separation on the allegations that she was being meted out at the Instance of the defendant-husband not only with mental but physical cruelty. Apart from the decree of judicial separation, she also claimed a decree for the return of the articles, cash detailed in Schedule-A of the plaint and Rs. 1000/- towards maintenance. 8. The suit of the plaintiff was contested by the defendant-husband denying her allegations. It was alleged that the assertions made by the plaintiff were totally false, malicious and inelegant. It was further asserted that the plaintiff-wife had come up with false allegations with a mala fide intention. The husband had asserted that the plaintiff had made up her mind for the dissolution of marriage (vivah vichchhed) and it was with that object in view, had got the criminal proceedings initiated against him and his family members, although there was neither any reason for the same nor any necessity. 9. The husband further asserted that upto 23-1-91 he had made every effort to keep the plaintiff with him but all his efforts went in vain on account of her attitude and behaviour. The written statement was filed on 4-11-1992 asserting that now in the changed circumstances, the defendant wanted decree for dissolution of the marriage. 10. In the written statement, a counterclaim was set-up as contemplated under Section 23A of the Hindu Marriage Act. In the counter-claim, it was asserted that the plaintiff wanted that the defendant-husband should severe and break all his relations with his father and brother and reside separately somewhere else leaving the common residence, which was being used in separate portions. The wife, it was claimed, had throughout been insisting that the husband should severe all his connections with family members and live separately. The husband claimed that the plaintiff always neglected him and acted against his wishes, although he gave top priority to her wishes. In this connection, it was indicated that immediately after his marriage with the plaintiff when the marriage of his sister was performed on 18-6-1986, the plaintiff in-spite of persuasion did not attend the said marriage. Similarly, in the year 1986, without any Information, the wife had gone to her parents house on the occasion of Diwali and came back long after during Holl in the next year. In the meantime, in spite of repeated requests, she did not come to her husband's house and stuck to her obstinacy. Again, in the year 1987 on the festival of Nagpanchmi. she went to her parents' house and did not turn up for about 1 1/2 years. The husband also asserted that the plaintiff's brother without any justifiable reason started criminal proceedings against him being criminal case No. 35/90 and got a search warrant issued, although there had not been any restraint on the movement of the plaintiff and she always went out of her own will but she disclosed her meanmindedness bySmt. Surbhi Agrawal vs Sanjay Agrawal on 9 December, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1507720/ 2getting initiated criminal proceedings against the husband and his family members. The husband asserted that in fact it was the plaintiff who had been acting with cruelty and had got initiated criminal proceedings against the husband and his family members on false allegations. 11. The defendant in his evidence in support of his claim had filed the certified copy of the statement of the plaintiff filed in the Criminal Proceedings initiated by Kishan Das, her brother, registered as Criminal Case No. 35/90. 12. The statement of the plaintiff was recorded before the Magistrate on 19-12-1990. In her statement, she had stated that she was being forcibly detained by her in-laws. They did not allow her to meet her brother or any person coming from the house of her parents. She also alleged that her mother-in-law, father-in-law as well as the husband were beating her. This mar-peet was disclosed to be on account of Dahej. She also stated that her Jethani had killed her eight months old daughter. This Jethani, it was stated, was always saying that she (Surbhi Agrawal) had eaten away the child. It was also stated that she had not been given any food for five or six days and she was being threatened to be turned out of the house on account of dowry. She further stated that she was not allowed to use the telephone. 13. In the aforesaid proceedings, besides impleading the plaintiff, her husband, his elder brother as well as the father-in-law had been impleaded as opposite parties. 14. The Magistrate believing her statement made on oath before him had come to the conclusion that she was being detained against her wishes and issued the search warrant. The search warrant was executed, She was produced before the Magistrate where she started weeping and stated that she was being beaten by her in laws and she was not being permitted to meet her Mayka people. She was set at liberty to go to her parents' house along with her brother. 15. In support of her claim, the plaintiff had examined herself as P.W. 1. In her statement, she had deposed that she was being harassed on account of dowry from the first day of her marriage. Her in-laws were hurling abuses on her and did not allow her to go to her parents' house. Even after the death of her daughter, she was not meted out with good behaviour. She was being beaten and told that why she did not give a birth to son and why the daughter was born. On this account saying so, she was beaten. The daughter was being kept by Rashmi Agrawal, the wife of the brother of the husband. The behaviour of her father-in law towards her was not good. He used to call her at 12 in the night for massaging his feet and on her refusal she was being treated with cruelty. After the death of her daughter, she could not meet her relations in the Mayka. Her brother was not allowed to meet her. She admitted that she had gone to the A.D.M.'s Court. She had been called at the police station, where she had gone with her brother. She also admitted that she had sent a notice to her husband. She stated in categorical terms that the reply of the notice, which had been given to her by her husband, was false. She denied the allegations of the husband in regard to the cruelty, etc. 16. In paragraph 8 of her deposition, she categorically stated that she was not prepared to live in Morar. She however clarified that she had refused to live there as she did not want to live along with her mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, etc. She however denied that she had asked herSmt.

That petition is being resisted by the applicant by filing a detailed written statement. The applicant in para 13 of the written statement contended that in the marriage the non-applicant has been able to gain handsome amounts and also received attractive and costly presents, the list of which would be filed in due course. During the pendency of the petition an application (Exh. 64) was moved by the applicant stating therein that the non-applicant has contravened rule 4(i)(h) of the Hindu Marriage and Divorce Rules, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Rules"") framed by the Bombay High Court under Sections 14 and 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act by not disclosing in the petition the particulars relating to property mentioned in Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act and, therefore, the petition filed by the non-applicant should be dismissed. 3. The non-applicant filed his reply inter alia contending that the provisions of rule 4(i)(h) of the Rules framed by the High Court is only directory and not mandatory. His further contention was that Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for disposal of the property jointly owned by the applicant and the non-applicant. Since there is no property as contemplated by Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the same was not mentioned in the petition. According to the non-applicant, the application was frivolous and the petition was maintainable. 4. After hearing the parties the learned court below passed the order impugned rejecting the application outright. According to the learned court below Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act had no application in the present case because that section did not apply to exclusive properties of any spouse received by them at the time of marriage. It also held that Rule 4(i)(h) of the Rules is not mandatory as claimed on behalf of the applicant, but it is directory as contended on behalf of the non-applicant. These findings are now being assailed in this revision. 5. Mrs. Sirpurkar, Advocate, appearing on behalf of the applicant very strenuously criticised the order impugned by contending that the property envisaged by Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act must not only be the property which jointly belonged to the parties, but also includes individual properties. In this context reliance was placed on the decision of the Allahabad High Court in Kanta Prasad v. Om Wati, , and the latter judgment of the Delhi High Court in Anju Bhargava v. Rajesh Bhargava, (1986) 2 DMC 467. A further submission was also made that rule 4(i)(h) of the RulesNandini Sanjiv Ahuja vs Sanjiv Birsen Ahuja on 30 March, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/891794/ 1must be held to be mandatory and non-compliance thereof must be held to be fatal to the maintainability of the Hindu Marriage Petition. 6. Repelling the above contention on behalf of the non-applicant, it was submitted by Shri Oka, Advocate that in no circumstance the petition is liable to be thrown out for alleged non-compliance of Rule 4(i)(h) of the Rules since no such consequence is provided. Therefore, he further supported the order impugned by relying upon the cases discussed therein. 7. The Supreme Court in Pratibha Rani v. Surajkumar, , has pointed out that pure and traditional presents given to the bride in a Hindu wedding may be divided into three categories, viz.-- (a) property intended for exclusive use of the bride, e.g. her personal jewellery, wearing apparel, etc. (b) articles of dowry which may be for common use and enjoyment in the matrimonial home, and (c) articles given as presents to the husband or the parent-in-law and other members of his family."" In that case the Supreme Court was concerned with the question whether there can be a criminal prosecution of a husband, who did not return the articles, which were Stridhan of the wife under Section 405 of the Indian Penal Code. While answering the question in the affirmative it repelled the contention that the concept of Stridhan has been abolished because of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act. While dealing with Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Supreme Court said that Section 27 provides an ""alternate remedy"" to the wife to bring a suit for Stridhan property, which the husband has failed to return. At the same time the scope of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not decided probably because no arguments were advanced. 8. At this stage it becomes necessary to take notice of Section 27 which reads as under : ""27. In any proceeding under this Act, the court may make such provisions in the decree as it deems just and proper with respect to any property presented, at or about the time of marriage, which may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife."" Whereas Section 27 deals with the property belonging to the spouses, Section 26 deals with their children and Section 25 with permanent alimony and maintenance that may be awarded in favour of a party. The power of the Court to pass an order under these sections is discretionary. Obviously the object in enacting these sections is to ensure severance in possibly all respects between those spouses, who, as the court thinks, cannot live together. The intention behind framing these sections is to make every possible attempt to settle all possible disputes between such spouses and that too once for all so that there should not be again an opportunity to enter into fresh litigation with each other. Section 27 does not envisage deciding any question as to the title of the property involved therein. Keeping in view the above legislative intent and the plain language used in Section 27 the principles that emerge there from are as follows : --Nandini Sanjiv Ahuja vs Sanjiv Birsen Ahuja on 30 March, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/891794/ 2(i) The power of the matrimonial Court is discretionary and it is not incumbent on the Court to make provision in the decree with regard to disposal of the property. (ii) It must be a matrimonial proceeding pending under the Act and an application for disposal of the property must be made before the decision of the proceeding. (iii) The provision to be made must be just and proper as the Court deems having regard to the adjustment of equities between the parties and surrounding circumstances. (iv) The property contemplated must be such as was presented at a time or stage which is in close proximity of the marriage, whether presented before or after the marriage. (v) The property so presented may either be to the wife, husband or both and at the time the Court is required to exercise discretion the property may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife."" The word 'belong' as used in the section was interpreted exhaustively in Surinder Kaur v. Madan Gopal Singh, . Para 8 of the judgment reads as follows : ""Now it is well understood that the word ""belong"" necessarily does not reflect title to the property in the sense of ownership. It only denotes connection with property and is a ,term connecting a person with his possessions. It appears to me that the property thus presented to the spouses within the afore explained time limit, may fall jointly to belong to both the husband and the wife, irrespective of the title in those properties to be vesting in one or the other, or both. To give an earthly example, a saree presented by the husband, or anyone else to the wife, may or may not involve transfer of title to the saree to the wife, but will belong to her exclusively, and not jointly to both the husband and the wife, as the very natureof the garment so suggests. Similarly, a suit presented to the husband in the same fashion would be exclusively belonging to the husband. Properties and articles presented from any source and to any one of them which by the very nature of the present, or by intention of the donor, or by tacit agreement of spouses, has come to be jointly in use by both the husband and the wife, can well be said to belong jointly to both of them. An earthly example of such incident can be that of a set of dining table and chairs for joint user in the matrimonial home irrespective of the fact as to which spouse received it as a present within that allocated time. The said dining table and chairs would obviously be joint belonging of both the husband and the wife and capable of being subjected to orders under Section 27 of the Act."" I fully subscribe to this view. Section 27 provides for sharing of that property, which the spouses received individually or collectively as presents at or about the time of marriage and which has come to be as a way of life in their joint use in their day-today living and thus may belong jointly to them. Such joint belongings require the attention of court for proper apportionment. 9. In the Allahabad case of Kanta Prasad v. Om Wati, , a power of the Court was spelt out that the Court can even pass a decree relating to property belonging exclusively either to the husband or wife as a power inherent to the proceedings under the Act. That decision does not decide the real controversy actually at issue. As a matter of fact, the said decision equates the words ""belong jointly""Nandini Sanjiv Ahuja vs Sanjiv Birsen Ahuja on 30 March, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/891794/ 3","['27', '26', '13', '14', '25']"
267,"Delhi High Court Upendra Kumar vs Harpriya Kumar on 19 January, 1978 Equivalent citations: ILR 1978 Delhi 97 Author: P Narain Bench: P Narain JUDGMENT Prakash Narain, J. (1) This appeal raises several questions oflaw. In order, however, to appreciate the contentions raised it is firstnecessary to notice facts. (2) The parties hereto are Hindus. They were married on 11/03/1974 at Ram Nagar in Uttar Pradesh in accordance with Hindurites. After marriage the couple went to and resided at Buxar, theplace of the husband. They lived together as husband and wife onlyfor two days for in the forenoon of 14/03/1974 the respondentleft for her parental home. The parties have never resided togetherat any place thereafter. On 18/09/1975 the appellantfiled a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act againstthe respondent praying for the grant of a decree for restitution ofconjugal rights. This petition was filed in the court of the DistrictJudge, Delhi. The respondent was served with the notice of THE petition. Appearance was put in on her behalf and on 13/11/1975 a request was made to grant time to file the written statementor reply to the petition under Section 9 of the said Act. Time wasgranted to the respondent and the hearing was adjourned to 5/01/1976. On 15/12/1975 an application was filed on behalfof the respondent for holding the proceedings in camera. On 5/01/1976 the respondent filed her written statement. The trial Courtthereafter fixed 30/04/1976 as the date for appearance of theparties in order to investigate the possibilities of reconciliationbetween the couple. Instead of appearing in person the respondent,however, moved the trial Court to fix a preliminary issue on thepoint of territorial jurisdiction of the District Judge, Delhi, to try THE petition under Section 9 of the Act. The point of jurisdiction, it maybe noticed, was not taken up at any time prior to this stage. Thetrial Court, thereafter framed the following issue:-""Whether this court has jurisdiction to try this petition ?"" (3) The appeallant's case before the trial Court was that the DistrictJudge, Delhi, had jurisdiction to try the petition because the appellant/petitioner was a permanent' resident of Delhi and was stillresiding in Delhi where the wife was bound in law to dischargeher marital obligations qua the husband. The respondent, however,relied on Section 19 of the said Act and took up the plea that as neitherthe marriage was solemnised at Delhi nor the husband and wife everresided or last' resided at Delhi, the Courts a.t Delhi had no jurisdictionto entertain the petition. (4) The trial Court came to the conclusion that it did not haveterritorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition. It repelled the contention that it had jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Code of CivilProcedure read with Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Accordingto the trial Court Section 19 clearly covered the point of territorialjurisdiction. It, therefore, returned the petition to the appellant forbeing presented to the proper court. Aggrieved by the said order theappellant has preferred the present appeal.Section 3(b) defines ""District Court"" as under :- ""'district court' means, in any area for which there is a citycivil court, and in any other area the principalcivil court of original jurisdiction, and includes any othercivil court which may be specified by the StateUpendra Kumar vs Harpriya Kumar on 19 January, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1224358/ 1Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, as havingjurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in thisAct;"" This definition is somewhat different from the definition of '""DistrictCourt"" in Indian Divorce Act, 1869.

It shall deal with the matter a little laterbecause first I will notice the other relevant provisionswhich arise for consideration in this case.""   Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as under :-    ""19.Every petition under this Act shall be presented to thedistrict court within the local limits of whose ordinaryoriginal civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnisedor the husband and wife reside or last resided together.""   Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 has been amendedby the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 68 of 1976 and the sectionnow reads as under :-    ""19.Court to which petition shall be presented :-Every petition under this Act shall be presented to the districtcourt within the local limits of whose ordinary originalcivil jurisdiction:-(i) the marriage was solemnised, or(ii) the respondent, at the time of the presentation of THE petition resides, or(iii) the parties to the marriage last resided together, or(iv) the petitioner is residing at the time of the presentation ofthe petition, in a case where the respondent is, at thattime, residing outside the territories to which ""this Actextends, or has not been heard of as being alive for aperiod of seven years or more by those persons whowould naturally have heard of him if he were alive.""   Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as under :-    ""21.Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act andto such rules as the High Court may make in thisbehalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulatedas far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure,1908.""   Since reference has been made to the Code of Civil Procedure someof the provisions of the Code which are relied upon may also be read.Section 4 reads as under :-       ""4.(1) In the absence of any specific provision to the contrary,nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any special or local law now in force or anyspecial jurisdiction or power conferred, or any specialform of procedure prescribed, by or under any otherlaw for the time being in force.    (2)In particular and without prejudice to the generality ofthe proposition contained in Sub-section (1), nothing inthis Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect anyremedy which a landholder or landlord may have underany law for the time being in force for the recovery of rentof agricultural land from the produce of such land.""   Section 9 of the Code reads as under :--    ""9.The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil natureexcepting suits of which their cognizance is cither expressly or impliedly barred..Explanation.-A suit in which the right to property or to anoffice is contested is a suit or a civil nature, notwithstandingthat such right may depend entirely on the decision ofquestions as to religious rites or ceremonies.""   Section 20 of the Code reads as under :-""20. Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall beinstituted in a Court within the local limits of whosejurisdiction-       (A)the defendant, or each of the defendants where thereare more than one, at the time of the commencementof the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carrieson business or personally works for gain; or    (B)any of the defendants, where there are more than one,at the time of commencement of the suit, actuallyand voluntarily resides or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such caseeither the leave of the Court is given, or the defendantswho do not reside or carry on business, or personallywork for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution;    (C)the cause of action, wholly or in part arises.Explanation 1.-Where a person has a permanent dwelling atone place and also a temporary residence at another place,he shall be deemed to reside at both places in respect ofany cause of action arising at the place where he hassuch temporary residence.Explanation II.-A corporation shall be deemed to carry onbusiness at its sole or principal office in India or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where ithas also a subordinate office, at such place.""   (5) The first contention that has been made on behalf of the appellant is that by virtue of the provisions of Section 21 of the HinduMarriage Act the Code of Civil Procedure is made applicable toproceedings under the said Act and so, even if the petition wasnot maintainable under Section 19 of the Act it should have been heldthat the District Court in Delhi had jurisdiction to entertain the petitionby virtue of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil ProcedureThe contention is since the cause of action or a part of the cause ofaction, viz. the failure of the wife to discharge her marital obligationsto the husband at the place where the husband resides, arises at Delhi,the appellant being a permanent resident of Delhi, it should havebeen held that the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction to entertain THE petition. Of this contention there were two facets. First, that byvirtue of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act Section 20 of theCode of Civil Procedure stands incorporated in the said Act, andsecondly, the petition under Section 9 of the Act was a compositepetition or suit and could be treated cither as a petition under theHindu Marriage Act simplicitor or a suit under Section 9 of the Codeof Civil Procedure. (6) In my opinion, neither of the two facets of the contention putforward can be accepted. Section 21 of the Act, no doubt, providesthat all proceedings under the Act shall be regulated, as far asmay be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, all the same the meaningof this provision is that the conduct of proceedings would be, asfar as possible, in accordance with the procedure prescribed by theCode. This section cannot be read to incorporate every provision ofthe Code of Civil Procedure in the Hindu Marriage Act. The legislature advisedly used the phrase ""all proceedings under this ActUpendra Kumar vs Harpriya Kumar on 19 January, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1224358/ 2shallbe regulated"". A reading of this phrase makes it amply clear that IT is only the procedural aspect which would be controlled by the Codeof Civil Procedure and not the substantive aspect of things like jurisdiction. To take an example. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedurelays down that the Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits ofcivil nature. Which courts is not specified in the Code. In Delhi, thePunjab Courts Act lays down which courts will try matters of civilnature. Furthermore, the Delhi High Court Act also lays down whichmatters according to pecuniary jurisdiction would be tried on theoriginal side of the High Court. Now ""District Court"" under theHindu Marriage Act means, as far as Delhi is concerned, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction or any other civil court whichmay be specified by the State Government by notification in theOfficial Gazette. These other courts which may be notified may notbe the ce court of the District Judge. For example, a Sub Judge may benotified as District Court within the meaning of Section 3(b) of thesaid Act. This would be different from the court postulated by Section 9 of the Code or under the Punjab Courts Act or the Delhi High CourtAct. As another example I may notice Section 28 of the HinduMarriage Act. This makes a specific provision among other thingsfor appeal. It cannot be said that the. appeal postulated by Section 28 of the Act is the same kind of appeal as is postulated by Section 96 of the Code or Section 104 of the Code. It is one of the settledcanone of interpretation that a special law overrides a general law.The Code of Civil Procedure is a general law. The Hindu MarriageAct is a special law. Therefore, it would be stretching one's imagination to say that the general law has been incorporated in the speciallaw in its entirety. I cannot persuade myself to give Section 21 of theinterpretation canvassed that by virtue of it the provisions of Section 20 of the Code can be incorporated in it. If that was so, there wasno need to enact Section 19 in the Hindu Marriage Act. (7) My attention has been invited to a decision of the MadrasHigh Court in M. Gomathi v. S. Natarajan. . In this case the wife filed a petition under the HinduMarriage Act for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty anddisertion in the Court of City Civil Court, Madras. Pending disposalof that petition the wife also prayed, for interim maintenance whichwas ordered. The respondent raised an objection that the City CivilCourt had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition as neither was themarriage solemnised nor the husband and wife reside nor last residedtogether within the jurisdiction of that Court. This objection waspressed by the husband in an appeal from the order granting interimmaintenance. The lower Appellate Court held that the question ofterritorial jurisdiction had necessarily to be decided first and the trialCourt could not proceed to order interim maintenance till that issuewas decided. From that order the wife went up in revision to theHigh Court. This was heard by a learned Single Judge of that Court.It was urged before the High Court that Sections 19 and 21 of theHindu Marriage Act cannot be construed as excluding the operationof the Code of Civil Procedure. Referring to Section 4 of the Codeof Civil Procedure the High Court held :-""The effect of the savings clause will be that the provisions ofthe Civil P. C. shall be deemed not to limit or otherwiseaffect any provision relating to jurisdiction provided undera special enactment. In other words, by application ofthe Civil P.C. the provisions of the special lawas to jurisdiction shall not be limited or otherwise affected. In this case, if the Civil P. C. is foundto be applicable the provisions of the special enactmentwill not in any way be limited or otherwise affected; onthe other hand, the jurisdiction of the Court extended.Now the question will be whether Section 21 of the HinduMarriage Act will have the effect of excluding the jurisdiction that is conferred under Civil P. C.

The trial Court held that Item No. 2 of plaint 'A' schedule and Items 2 and 3 of plaint 'B' schedule were joint family properties as the same had been acquired out of the joint family income; that the 1st defendant failed to prove that Item No. 2 of plaint 'A' Schedule property and Items 2 and 3 of plaint 'B' Schedule properties were his self-acquired properties; that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the debts described in plaint 'C' schedule were due to the joint family and as such, they were entitled to get share in them; that the plaintiffs failed to prove that all the moveables described in plaint 'D' schedule were in existence; that only Item Nos. 1 to 15 and 26 entered in the inventory Ex.P-33 were available for partition.

In the light of the contentions raised on both the sides, the following points arise for consideration: 1) Whether the trial Court is justified in holding that Item No. 2 in Schedule 'A' and Items 2 and 3 in Schedule 'B' were the joint family properties? 2) Whether the trial Court is justified in holding that the marriage of the 2nd defendant (2nd appellant) with 1st defendant (1st appellant) was null and void and therefore, the issues born out of such wed-lock are not entitled to a share in the co-parcenary properties viz., the suit properties in respect of which the decree is passed and as such they are not necessary parties to the suit? 3) Whether the trial Court is right in not awarding a share to plaintiffs 5 and 6? 7. in this case, it is not in dispute that the 1st defendant (1st appellant) was the Manager of the joint family being the father of the plaintiffs and defendant No. 3. The joint family possessed vast properties capable of yielding considerable Income. The defendant No. 1 got 24 acres of land in a partition of the joint family properties between him and h is two brothers on 29-9-1972 under a registered Partition Deed. There is no acceptable evidence adduced by the 1st defendant to prove that he had an independent source of income and from that income, he purchased the properties described at Item No. 2 in 'A' Schedule and Items 2 and 3 in 'B' schedule. In the absence of such evidence, the trial Court on the basis of the evidence on record has held that the joint family possessed sufficient nucleus capable of yielding sufficient income and the 1st defendant has failed to prove that Item No. 2 in 'A' Schedule and items 2 and 3 in 'B' Schedule were his self-acquired properties. The trial Court has specifically held that these three properties are also joint family properties. From the evidence on record, nothing is brought to our notice which can be said to affect the decision of the trial Court on Issues Nos. 1 to 3. The Plaint 'A' and 'B' Schedules contain several properties consisting of both agricultural lands and house properties which were admittedly the joint family properties except Item No. 2 in plaint 'A' Schedule and Items 2 and 3 in plaint 'B' Schedule. As far as Item No. 2 in plaint Schedule 'A' is concerned, it is proved to be one of the properties of the joint family because under the Deed of Partition - Ex.P-24 - the joint family properties were divided between the 1st defendant and his brothers and in that partition, Item No. 2 was allotted to the share of the 1st defendant. As far as Items 2 and 3 of the 'B' Schedule are concerned, defendant No. 1 claimed that these two sites were purchased by him in the year 1956 and 1957 from one Basamma w/o Puttappa and one Basappa respectively under Ex.D-6 and D-7. The 1st defendant also further stated that he purchased Item No. 2 in 'B' Schedule on 18-6-1978 under Ex.D-8, a registered Sale Deed from one Siddappa and thereafter he constructed a house on each of the sites described in Items 2 and 3 of 'B' Schedule. The 1st defendant got vast extent of the property under a partition between himself and his two brothers on 29-9-1972. Being the father, he was the kartha of the family. There is no evidence adduced in the case to show that apart from vast extent of properties which he got in the partition, he had any other independent source of income. However, he tried to show that he had cultivated an extent of 35 acres for six years as a tenant, from 1958-59 to 1961-62, of the land belonging to one Chandrappa.

In this revision, Mr. T. Chandra-sekhara Menon, learned counsel for the petitioner, challenges the orders of the two courts, directing his client to pay"" maintenance or what is called, in the orders, as starving allowance, to the respondent herein at Rs. 12-50 per month. 2. The quantum of the amount allowed as maintenance does not loom large in this C. R. P. and in fact when the two courts have concurrently found that if maintenance is to be granted to the respondent, then having due regard to the sources of income of the petitioner and the means, if any, available to the respondent, Rs. 12-50 has to be paid per month, obviously the petitioner cannot challenge that question alone, in this Court under Section 1.15 of the Code. 3. But the contention that has been taken is a larger one namely that under the circumstances, in which the petitioner asked for judicial separation, as against respondent and later on also obtained a divorce alleging and establishing unchastity on the part of the respondent, the latter has no right at all to be awarded any maintenance whatsoever, under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 25 of 1955. 4. It is necessary to set out briefly the circumstances, under which, the claim for alimony was made by the respondent. The petitioner husband, there is no controversy, filed O. P. 3/58 under Sections 10 and 13 of Act 25 of 1955; and the District Court, Ernakulam granted judicial separation under Section 10 of the Act, by a decree dated 12-2-1960. 5. The petitioner alleging that after the decree in O. P. 3/58, the respondent, has not resumed cohabitation with the petitioner, for a space of 2 years required the dissolution of the marriage by a decree for divorce, and filed O. P. 5 of 1962 under Section 13 of the said Act for divorce. 6. In that application the respondent, no doubt, admitted the fact that there is a decree for judicial separation in O. P. 3/58; but nevertheless stated that she is still prepared to go and live with the petitioner. She also claimed to be entitled to be paid alimony under Section 25 of the said Act and for that purpose she filed I. A. 61/63. The respondent claimed alimony at the rate of Rs. 45/- per month on the ground that she is accustomed to a decent way of life and on the basis that the petitioner is getting not less than Rs. 100 as monthly income. It is only necessary to note that a decree for divorce has been passed in favour of the petitioner on the application, O. P. 5/62 filed by him. That aspect is no longer in controversy between the parties. But at the time of passing the decree of divorce, the Court after a consideration of the means of the parties, has directed the petitioner to pay the respondent a sum of Rs. 12.50 as alimony. That claim was recognised in favour of the respondent in the application filed by her as I. A. 61/63.Raja Gopalan vs Rajamma on 30 June, 1966 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1563609/ 17. Apart from disputing the allegation of the respondent regarding the income derived by the petitioner, the claim of the respondent for getting alimony tinder Section 25 of the Act was contested by the petitioner on the ground that the respondent is not entitled to any alimony whatsoever in view of the fact that the judicial separation in O. P. 3/58 was allowed on the ground of immorality on the part of the wife. 8. That contention was no doubt controverted by the respondent on the ground that she has got a right to claim maintenance under Section 25 of the Act; and if the necessary circumstances are established, it will be open to the petitioner to have the order cancelled or modified in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 25. 9. The learned Subordinate Judge, who dealt with the matter in the first instance, adverts to the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. The respondent has clearly indicated that she has no intention of marrying again. Therefore the Court proceeds on the basis, tbat the alimony has to be fixed, dependent upon the income and possession of other properties and the conduct of parties. The learned Judge then considers the question as to whether the ground on which judicial separation was granted in O. P. 3/58, namely, unchastity, is a circumstance which will totally disentitle the respondent from claiming any alimony whatsoever. 10. In that context, the learned Subordinate Judge adverts to a decision of a learned single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Amar Kanta Sen v. Sovana Sen, AIR 1960 Cal 438, wherein the learned Judge has expressed the view that even in eases, where marriage is dissolved on the ground of adultery of the wife, the latter will be entitled to a bare subsistence allowance or starving allowance from her husband. The learned Judge also, in so many words, states that he is not prepared to accept the extreme contention of the petitioner that as judicial separation, has been granted on the ground of unchastity the respondent should be left to the resources ot her immorality for her maintenance. On this line of reasoning, the learned Subordinate Judge ultimately, directed the petitioner, under Section 25 of the Act, to pay to the respondent a sum of Rs. 12.50 per month as maintenance so long as the respondent remains unmarried. 11. This order was challenged by the petitioner before the learned District Judge, Ernakulam in C. M. A. 38/63. There again, though the quantum also was challenged by the petitioner, ultimately the main attack fa against the order of the learned Subordinate Judge was that no alimony at all should have been directed to be paid under Section 25 of the Act, for the reason that adultery was the ground for granting judicial separation. 12. That aspect is considered by the learned District Judge, and after referring to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in (AIR 1960 Cal 438) relied upon by the learned Subordinate Judge, the District Court takes note of the fact there is another Division Bench Judgment of the same High Court reported in Sachindra Nath v. Banamala, AIR 1960 Cal 575, which latter decision has taken the view that under such circumstances, the prayer of the wife for alimony is to be refused. 13. The learned Judge is of the view that the Division Bench Judgment of the Calcutta High Court can be distinguished on the ground that the learned Judges of the High Court were dealing with aRaja Gopalan vs Rajamma on 30 June, 1966 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1563609/ 2case where the wife was leading an adulterous life even when the application for divorce was 61ed. The learned Judge is of the view that in this case, inasmuch as that circumstance is not present and as only a stray instance of moral laxity has been proved against the wife and inasmuch M there is nothing to show that the respondent continues to lead an adulterous We, her request for being paid, starving allowance, at any rate, will nave to be allowed. No doubt the learned District Judge says that if and when the petitioner is able to establish that the respondent has lapsed into immorality again, he can get relief by moving the Court for the said purpose. Therefore both the Court have ultimately held that, notwithstanding that the allegation of adultery was the foundation of the claim made in O. P. 3/58 and that claim was also accepted by the Court for granting judicial separation, nevertheless even under those circumstances the respondent to entitled to be paid at any rate, a starving maintenance under Section 25 of the Act. 14. This view expressed by both the Courts is challenged by Mr. T. Chandrasekhara Menon, learned Counsel for the petitioner --husband. 15. Mr. K. Neelakanta Menon, learned counsel for the respondent-wife supports the orders of the subordinate Courts. Even going by the wording of Section 25 of the Act, jurisdiction is given to the Court, at the time of considering an application for grant of maintenance, to take into account the conduct of the parties, and in this case, both the Courts have adverted to the aspect that there has been a stray instance of lapse on the part of the respondent, but nevertheless that conduct by itself is, according to both the Courts, not sufficient to disable her from claiming maintenance. 16. Therefore the question arises as to whether in a case where a charge of adultery is the very foundation of a claim for asking judicial separation and that claim is accepted by a Court notwithstanding that finding, the respondent against whom that finding has been entered, can claim, as of right, to be awarded maintenance under Section 25 of the Act. 17. It is necessary now to refer to some of the provisions contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 -- Act 25/1955 as well as The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 -- Act 78/1956, The first Act namely 1955 Act, provides in Sec. 10, the various grounds, under which a party can make an application to the Court seeking judicial separation. The application in this case, I am informed, was filed on the basis of an allegation made under Clause (f) of Section 10(1) of this Act, on the ground that, after the solemnization of the marriage, the respondent herein, had sexual intercourse with a person, other than her husband. It may also be stated at this stage, that the Court which considered O. P. 3/58 filed by the petitioner has accepted this allegation to be true and has found that the respondent is guilty of the conduct mentioned in Clause (f) of Section 10(1) of this Act. 18. Section 13 deals with divorce; and Subsection (1) provides for an application being presented by either a husband or wife for dissolving a marriage by decree of divorce as well as the various grounds which can form the basis of that application. Here again it may be pointed out that O. P. 5/62 filed by the petitioner for granting a decree of divorce was under Section 13(1)(viii) of this Act to the effect that the respondent has not resumed cohabitation for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation against that party which in this case was on 15-2-1960.Raja Gopalan vs Rajamma on 30 June, 1966 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1563609/ 3","['13', '1', '25', '10']"

This second appeal raises novel and difficult points with regard to the relations between a modern educated husband and his wife in Hindu Society. 2. The appellant in this appeal is the husband Dr. Narayan Ganesh Dastane. The respondent is his wife Mrs. Sucheta Narayan Dastaoe. They were married according to Vedic rites on May 13, 1956 in Poona. A daughter Shobha was born on March 11, 1957, a second daughter Vibhavari was born on March 20, 1959, and before the third daughter. Prabha was delivered, the husband and wife unfortunately fell out as it is undisputed that they have been living separately from each other since March 1961. 3. On February 19, 1962, the appellant filed the petition from which the present second appeal arises. In that petition the appellant prayed in the first instance for a declaration annulling the marriage under Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that the consent of the husband for the marriage was obtained by fraud. According to the husband, the wife was suffering from schizophrenia and she was treated in the Mental Hospital Yeravda some time in the year 1954; but schizophrenia was an incurable and dangerous form of unsoundness of mind, being hereditary and recurring; and these facts were suppressed from the husband before he consented for the marriage. The husband alleged that the parents and the relatives of the wife had known or ought to have known that the respondent's disease was diagnosed as schizophrenia before her marriage was settled with the petitioner and that they had deliberately concealed this fact from the petitioner and his father and deliberately gave them to understand and made them believe that the nature of the illness was simply a sunstroke and cerebral malaria. It is on this ground that the husband prayed for the decree of nullity of the marriage. In the alternative; the husband prayed for a decree of divorce under Section 13(1)(iii) on the ground that the wife had been incurably of unsound mind for a continuous period of not less than three years immediately before the presentation, of the petition. Finally, in the alternative, the husband prayed for a decree for judicial separation under Section 10(1)(b) alleging that the wife treated him with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the husband that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with her. 4. The wife in her written statement denied the allegations made in the petition and contended that she was and is always ready and willing to go and live with the petitioner. 5. The learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, by his judgment and decree dated July 31, 1965 while dismissing the claim of the husband for a decree for nullity of marriage and divorce ordered the husband to pay Rs. 400 per month as interim maintenance till the end of January 1965 and Rs. 280 per month from February 1, 1965 till the date of the judgment under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and further directed that on full payment of arrears of interim maintenance as ordered, the petitioner was entitled to a decree for judicial separation under Section 10(1)(b) of theNarayan Ganesh Dastane vs Sucheta Narayan Dastane on 24 February, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150660/ 1Hindu Marriage Act against the wife, He also ordered that the petitioner should pay Rs. 280 per month as future maintenance to the respondent and children under Sections 25 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and directed that the children of the petitioner and respondent should be in the custody of the respondent till they attained majority while at the same time ordering that in the interest of the children and the petitioner and the respondent, the petitioner must be given interview with the children once in a fortnight at a convenient place, preferably a public park or a residence of a common friend. The learned Judge ordered the parties to bear their own costs. 6. The wife filed Civil Appeal No. 700 of 1965 against the decree or judicial separation. The husband filed Civil Appeal No. 722 of 1965 against the decree refusing annulment of marriage and divorce. The two appeals were heard by the Fourth Extra Assistant Judge at Poona who by his judgment and decree dated January 8, 1968 allowed the wife's appeal and set aside the decree passed by the Civil Judge and dismissed the husband's appeal and ordered the husband to pay to the wife costs of the petition and of the two appeals as well as maintenance at the rate of Rs. 400 till the end of January 1965 and Rs. 280 per month from February 1, 1965 to the date of the judgment. 7. Feeling aggrieved by the said judgment and decree, the husband has filed the present second appeal. 8. The first ground urged in this appeal is that the Courts below erred in law in not granting a decree annulling the marriage under Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act notwithstanding that the husband established facts which show that his consent to the marriage was obtained by fraud. The relevant provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act are as follows:-- 12. ""(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds namely:-- (a) .... ... (b) .... ... (c) that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner is required under Section 5, the consent, of such guardian was obtained by force or fraud; or (d) ...... (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), no- petition for annulling a marriage:-- (a) on the ground specified in Clause (c) of Sub-section (1), shall be entertained if- (i) the petition is presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate . or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered; orNarayan Ganesh Dastane vs Sucheta Narayan Dastane on 24 February, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150660/ 2(ii) the petitioner has; with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered."" 9. The finding of the trial Court on this question is that there was no fraud committed by the respondent or her parents-or anyone else in getting the final consent from the petitioner to his marriage with the respondent, The trial Court held that the allegation of the husband in his petition that he came to know that the respondent suffered from schizophrenia on April 25, 1961 from a certificate of the entry in the register of the Mental Hospital at Yeravda dated April 10, 1961 was proved and that the husband came to know about the alleged fraud about respondent's disease being schizophrenia on April 25, 1961 after the receipt by him of the certificate Exhibit 208; and hence the petition filed by him on February 19, 1962 was not barred by limitation under Section 12(2)(a). He, however, considered the evidence on the point and came to the conclusion that the petitioner had decided to marry the respondent after fully considering the facts about the mental illness of the respondent as communicated ' in her father's letters dated April 25, 1956 and April 27, 1956, in view of the admissions made by , the petitioner himself and the contents of his own letter to the respondent's father dated April 30, 1956, Exhibit 567. 10. In appeal the learned Assistant Judge considered the entire evidence on the record on the point and found that the petitioner had failed to prove"" that his consent to the marriage was obtained by any fraud, holding that considering the contents of the letter addressed by the respondent's father and all the circumstances of the case, it was evident that the petitioner, with open eyes gave the consent for his marriage by his letter dated 30th April, 1956, Exhibit 567, observing as follows:-- ""Petitioner had seen the respondent before marriage, petitioner had talk with the respondent before marriage. Not only the petitioner, his father, his family members had a talk with the respondent. The respondent entered the kitchen of the petitioner's family, did some work in the family as recorded by the petitioner's father in his letter, Exhibit 566. It cannot be said that the consent of the petitioner for the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was obtained by fraud."" 11. Now, these concurrent findings on the question of fraud are essentially questions of fact. Mr. Bhasme, however, argued that this finding of fact is based on a misconstruction of the relevant letters which clearly show that the petitioner and his family members were misled by the suppression of the disease from which the wife suffered in 1954 and a representation falsely made that she had an attack of sun-stroke. There is no merit in this contention because in his letter, dated April 23, 1956, Exhibit 394 the respondent's father had clearly informed the petitioner's father as follows:-- ""My wife writes to me from Poona that you yourself, Shrimati Dastane and your son have approved of my, daughter, Ch. Meera. I feel very happy about the approval.Narayan Ganesh Dastane vs Sucheta Narayan Dastane on 24 February, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150660/ 3","['10', '13', '24', '12', '5']"

Patankar, J. 1.The marriage between Appellant-wife and Respondent-husband came to be solemnized according to Budhist Rites on 17-1-1988. The couple was blessed with a daughter by name Sampada born on 15-12-1988. The delivery took place at the place of Appellant's parents which is situated nearby the matrimonial house. Thereafter the Appellant resumed co-habitation. However, on 24-2-1989 the Respondent left Appellant and the daughter at Appellant's parents house and was not allowed to return. The Appellant filed Petition No. PE-1964/89 for her maintenance and for maintenance of the daughter under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code. The Respondent filed Petition No. PE/969/89 for restitution of conjugal rights. The Application filed by the Appellant for maintenance and the petition filed by the Respondent came to be heard together. The learned Judge of the Family Court granted maintenance for the daughter at the rate of Rs. 100/- per month from 16-4-1989 and refused for the Petitioner. The petition filed by the Respondent for restitution of conjugal rights was decreed on 20-1-1991. 2. The Respondent filed Petition No. PA/116/92 on 15-2-1992 claiming divorce under Section 13(1-A)(ii) of Hindu Marriage Act 1955 (hereinafter referred to as Hindu Marriage Act) on the ground that there was no resumption of co-habitation, for more than 1 year after the date of passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. It was the case of the Respondent that he had sent a letter dated 8-3-1991 (Ex. 21) by registered post A.D. to the Appellant calling upon her to resume cohabitation. She received the same but neither replied nor resumed cohabitation. Thereafter he (sent another letter on 16-4-1992 (Exh. 22). The same was refused by the Appellant (Exh. 23), another letter was sent on 26-9-1991 (Exh. 25). It was also refused and returned on 28-9-1991 (Exh. 26). Thereafter on 14-10-1991 one more letter was sent (Exh. 27) calling upon the Appellant to resume cohabitation, but it was refused on 16-10-1991 (Exh. 28). She has not resumed cohabitation. Therefore, she has failed to resume cohabitation in spite of the attempts made by the Respondent and there is no bar in granting the decree for divorce. 3. The Appellant filed written statement Exh. 8 on 23-8-1992 and inter alia contended that immediately after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights was passed on 20-1-1991, the Appellant went to the house of Respondent along with daughter for resuming cohabitation However, mother of Respondent declined to accept her and she was driven out. After she received the first letter dated 8-3-1991, she went along with her mother and neighbours to the house of Respondent on 18-9-1991. However, the Respondent and her mother threatened her and others, and she was forcibly driven out along with the child. This has happened in the afternoon and in the evening she filed complaint Exh. 40 with Janwadi Police Chowky. Respondent was called at the Police Chowky. However, he declined to accept her pointing out the litigation between the parties. She contended that she has not received other letters. It wasMrs. Sunita Rajendra Nikalje vs Rajendra Eknath Nikalje on 7 October, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/636075/ 1contended that Respondent was in the wrong and was trying to take advantage of his own wrong and cannot get the decree in view of provisions of Section 23(1)(a) of Hindu Marriage Act. 4. The learned Judge of the trial Court came to the conclusion that there was no cohabitation between the parties for more than one year after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights was passed. He held that there was no bar for granting the decree of divorce in favour of the Respondent. He declined to accept that the Respondent was taking advantage of his own wrong. He held that bar of Section 23(1)(a) is not attracted. Therefore, he passed the decree for dissolution of marriage and also directed the Respondent to pay maintenance at the rate of Rs. 300/- per month to the Appellant by way of permanent alimony from the date of the said order. The judgment and order was passed on 30-5-1993. The same is challenged by the Appellant in this Appeal. 5. After the petition was decided, the Appellant filed PE 1166/93 under Section 127 of Criminal Procedure Code for enhancement of maintenance granted to the daughter. The said petition came to be allowed after hearing both the sides on 10-9-1993 and maintenance was enhanced to Rs. 250/-. 6. In this appeal the Appellant filed Civil Application No. 25161/1994 on 20-4-1994 praying that interim maintenance pending the appeal at the rate of Rs. 1000/- be granted to her and she be granted permanent alimony at that rate. The Division Bench of this Court passed the order on 20-4-1994 granting ad-interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 500/- per month pending the appeal. 7. The learned Advocate for the Appellant submitted that the trial Court has erred in holding that the Respondent was not taking advantage of his own wrong and has failed to appreciate the evidence in that respect. He submitted that the Bar of Section 23(1)(a) is clearly attracted and no decree for dissolution of marriage could have been passed. The learned Advocate for the Respondent disputed this submission and supported the judgment passed by the trial Court. 8. In view of the submissions at the Bar, the point that arises for our consideration is whether Respondent is trying to take advantage of his own wrong or that the bar of Section 23(1)(a) is attracted in this case. Our answer is -- yes. 9. We shall first set out the background of the parties. The Respondent husband is working in a canteen run by Rustom Engineering Company. He is aged abut 30 years and was getting about Rs. 2250/- per month as salary. The Appellant is a house wife. Both are semi illiterate and come from ordinary families. Both the families are staying at Pune. Their houses are situated at 5 minutes walking distance, from each other. 10. The Respondent in support of his petition led his own evidence (Exh. 20) and that of his mother Sushila (Exh. 37), while the Appellant in support of her case led her evidence (Exh. 39), of her mother Shantabai (Exh. 41) and neighbour Chandrabai's (Exh. 42) evidence. 11. The document produced on record are the letters sent by Respondent by Registered Post A.D. at Exhs. 21, 22, 25 and 27 and the refusal A. Ds at Exhs. 23, 26 and 28. The Appellant producedMrs. Sunita Rajendra Nikalje vs Rajendra Eknath Nikalje on 7 October, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/636075/ 2complaint filed by her at Exh. 40 with Janwadi Police Station, Pune. 12. The Respondent in his evidence has deposed about sending letters at Exhs. 21, 22, 25 and 27 and proved the refusal thereof by producing postal acknowledgments. He also stated that he tried to see that Appellant resumed cohabitation. But the Appellant neither replied nor resumed cohabitation. In the cross-examination he denied the case of the Appellant that she went to the house of the Respondent for cohabitation after the decision of PA 969/89 and his mother drove her out. He also denied that Appellant came to his house on 18-4-1991 along with her mother and others in the afternoon and that the Respondent and his mother quarrelled with them and drove them out of the house. However, he admitted that the Police called him on 18-4-1991 as per complaint filed by the Appellant. He also admitted that he went to the Police Station at about 6-00 p.m. and that he did not take back the Appellant on that day. However, he added that he did not take her as the Appellant demanded separate residence. The mother of the Respondent Sushila has denied in her evidence that the Appellant came to her house after the decision in PA No. 969/1989 and she drove her out of the house. She also denied that the Appellant came to her house in the noon along with her mother and others and that she was driven out by her and the Respondent. 13. The Appellant deposed that after 3rd day of the decision she went to the Respondent's house for cohabitation. However, Respondent's mother did not permit her to stay and she was driven out. She further stated she received the letter on 8-3-1991 and went to the house of the Respondent along with her mother, brother-in-law and neighbour on 18-4-1991 for cohabitation. At that time the Respondent's mother abused her and they declined to accept her. This was done in spite of entreaties of her mother to accept the Appellant. When she tried to go in the house she was forcibly driven out and Respondent gave threats to her life. She deposed that she filed complaint with Janwadi Police Station (Exh. 40) and the Police called the Respondent at Police Station. The Appellant tried to convince him, but the Respondent declined to accept and demanded divorce. She denied that she demanded any separate residence from the Respondent at the Police Chowky. In the cross-examination she denied that she refused letter Exh. 22 dated 16-4-1991 on 18-4-1991 and then went to the Police Station and filed a false complaint. The Respondent also examined Shantabai, her mother at Exh. 41. She deposed that she went along with the Appellant to the Respondent's house on Thursday (incidentally 18-4-1991 was Thursday). She went along with her son-in-law and neighbours at about 4-30 p.m. In spite of their requests the Respondent and his mother declined to accept the Appellant for cohabitation. They abused them and drove them out by giving threat to Appellant that she should not come to their house. Appellant lodged complaint with the Police. The Police called the Respondent to Police chowky. However, the Respondent demanded divorce. In the cross-examination suggestion was given that Appellant wanted separate residence but it was denied. She admitted that no letter was sent to the Respondent, but she went to him four times. Neighbour Chandra-bai was examined by the Appellant at Exh. 42. She deposed that she went along with the Appellant and her mother-in-law and brother-in-law to the house of the Respondent. The Respondent and his mother did not permit the Appellant to join the Respondent. Thereafter they went to the Police chowky.

As against the 1st accused a private complaint was laid Under Section 494 IPC read with Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Central Act XXV of 1955) alleging that this accused, a retired elementray School teacher, contracted a marriage with the 2nd accused, who is the daugther of accused 3 and 4, even though he had at the date the marriage with the 2nd accused the complainant as his wife. The 2nd accuse is the second wife of 1st accused; and accused 3 and 4 who are the father and mother of the 2nd accused, stood charged Under Section 494 read with Sections 109 and 114 IPC The learned Additional District Munsif-Magistrate found that the second marriage of the 1st accused with the 2nd accused was solemnized at 2-00 a.m. on 1-9-1959 in Seethanagaram In Rajahmundry taluk, and believing the evidence of the 3rd accused who deposed as D.W, 2 that A-2 and A-4 had no knowledge of the marriage, acquitted them. The 1st accused was charged and convicted Under Section 494 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 900/-; the 3rd accused was also found guilty Under Section 494 IPC read with Section 114 IPC and sentenced to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment. On appeal by accused 1 and 3, the learned Sessions Judge held the view that the 3rd accused gave his daughter in. marriage under a mistaken impression that the previous marriage of the 1st accused with the complainant has been annulled and that therefore, the 3rd accused did not intentionally aid the commission of the offence. He, therefore, allowed Criminal Appeal No. 332 of 1959 filed by the 3rd accused, but confirmed the conviction and sentence imposed on the 1st accused as he dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 338 of 1959. 3. A few more facts may be briefly stated: The complainant, Suhbalakshmi, married Mu tyala Paradesi (A-1) in 1947. She had three daughters by the 1st accused but only one or them is alive. They lived in Undrajavaram of Tanuku Taluk in West Godavri District. In or about 1955 and 1956, there were differences between the complainant and her husband. Thereafter the 1st accused arranged with Bulusu Suryanarayana (A-3) to marry his daughter Saraswati (A-2), The 1st accused at about 3-00 P. m., on 31-8-1958 arrived at Seethanagram where Saraswathi and Suryanarayana lived, for having the marriage celebrated. Just about that time, Suryanarayana (A-3), father of Saraswathi, came to know that the 1st accused was having a wife alive, and therefore he and P. Ws. 2 and 3 questioned the 1st accused about it. It is in evidence that the 1st accused told them that (he complainant left his protection and that her marriage with him was annulled. Regarding this, the""Padullaparthi Mutyala Paradeshi vs Padullaparthi Subbalakshmi And ... on 3 August, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1632111/ 13rd accused examined as D.W. 2 has further stated that ""he (A-1) would not; have agreed to the present marriage if he had not the prior marital the cancelled in view of the prevailing Hindu Law."" Bulusu Suryanarayanamurti also deposed {hat the marriage of the 1st accused with his daughter, Saraswathi, was celebrated at Seethanagaram and that the 1st accused is his son-in-law and the husband of the 2nd accused. Subbalakshmi, the complainant, deposed as P. W, 1 that she cams to know of this marriage only two months prior to the filing of this complaint and she sent a registered notice (Exhibit A-2) later. P.W. 2 deposed that he was orally invited to the marriage of A-l with A-2 on 1-9-1958 and that he attended the marriage celebration which took place at 2-00 A. M. at Bulusu Suryanarayarnurthi's house. It was elicited from him in further cross-examination that no person from a different village came to attend that marriage and that the purohit that officiated at the marriage was alive and available in Seethanagaram. He stated that there were pipers and no presents were given by A-l to A-2 or by A-3 to the bridal couple. P.W. 3 is a rich man who spent money for the marriage as he wanted t0 help Surynarayanamurthi who is a poor man. P.W. 3 also attended the marriage function. He was also present when the terms of the marriage were settled. He spoke of the presence of P.W. 2 at the marriage. According to him, the petitioner and another by name B. Ramamurthi Avadhani of Rajahmundry also came On 31-8-1958. He spoke to the performance of the marriage of 1st' accused and Saraswathi at the 3rd accused's house. The 1st accused denied the offence and stated that he did not know any of the prosecution witnesses who, according to him, depose falsely having been bribed. The 3rd accused who was permitted to represent A-2 and A-4 stated that the marriage of A-l with Saraswthi was true but brought by misrepresentations of the 1st accused. 4. Both the lower courts relied upon the evidence of these witnesses and also that of A-3 who deposed as D. W, 2 and held that the prosecution established that the bigamous marriage was solemnized. Before the learned Sessions Judge, a. point that the ingredients necessary to establish a Hindu marriage have not been proved, was taken on behalf of the 1st accused. It was put on the ground that as the parties are Brahmins, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that the ceremonies at the marriage including that of Saptapadi have in fact taken place. The learned Sessions Judge has pointed out that, beyond suggesting that P.Ws. 2 and 3 were bribed by A-3, do other questions were put in cross-examination. Keeping .therefore in mind (Jaat there was no cross-examination directed as to the want of proper and necessary ceremonies and remarking that not even a whisper was made that the form of marriage went through by the appellant (A-1) and the 2nd accused was not; known to or recognised by law and also observing that the validity of the latest marriage of the latest accuse cannot be questioned negatived the contention of the 1st accused that his marriage with A-2 U not bigamous. 5. In this revision petition the same point is again agitated and elaborately argued by Mr. ParthasarathySwamy the learned Counsel for the petitioner. He contends firstly 'that the prosecution, when it charges a person with the offence of bigamy punishable Under Section 494 IPC should prove positively, apart from the marriage which is subsisting, that the accused contracted another valid marriage in accordance with the rites obtaining in the particular caste or sect of the Hindus; and secondly if there is no proof by the prosecution of such a valid second marriage, there isPadullaparthi Mutyala Paradeshi vs Padullaparthi Subbalakshmi And ... on 3 August, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1632111/ 2no offence of bigamy. In other words, having regard to the facts of the instant case, what is contended by the learned Counsel is, that short of the evidence of the taking of the seventh step as a result of the performance of ceremony of Saptapadi which must be made available by evidence of the direct witnesses there is no other way of proving the solemnization of a marriage in such a case. The learned Counsel pointed out that just as the first marriage, the second offending marriage should be established as haying taken place by due performance of ceremonies including Saptapadi; and maintained that any inferential conclusion otherwise leading to the establishment thereof is, at any rate, outside the purview of the scheme of the Hindu Marriage Act. He submitted that the importance of including Section 7 in the Hindu Marriage Act has to be recognized, in that special significance is to be attached to the stress laid on he mention made about the marriage becoming complete and binding only when, the seventh step is taken in the ceremony of Saptapadi. It would thus be seen that in substance, the learned Counsel has been urging that whatever position was before the enactment of Central Act XXV of 1955, no complainant can succeed thereafter in getting the accused punished for an offence of bigamy without leading evidence as to the taking of the seventh step when the parties to the second marriage are Brahmins. 6. For the determination of the points so raised, a preliminary examination of how the penal provisions contained in Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code came to be applied to the case of Hindus cannot be considered unimportant. Before 1946, the marriages between Hindus were; not made monogamous by statute unless such marriages were contracted between Hindus under the Special Marriage Act (III of 1872). A few statutes such as the Madras Marumakkattayam Act IXXII of 1933) probihited polygamy and the Madras Nambudri Act, which governed the Nambudris in the province of Madras', allowed the taking of a second wife by a Nambudri only in some contingencies. The second marriage by a woman was not also unknown which depended upon desertion or putting away of the wife by her husband. In the State of Bombay, the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriages Act, 1946 (XXV of 1946) made the contract of bigamous marriage void and penal. The Saurashtra Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriages Act, 1950 had a similar effect in that State. A similar legislation in Madhya Pradesh made marriages between Hindus in that State monogamous. In the State of Madras as it existed then, the Madras Hindu (Bigamy Prevention and Divorce) Act (VI of 1949) rendered any marriage solemnized after the commencement ot the Act between a man and woman either of whom has a1 spouse living at the time of such solemnization void, notwithstanding any rule of law, custom or usage of the contrary, while preserving the right of a man or woman whose marriage has been dissolved by a final order of a Court Under Section 5 of that Act, or under any other law for the time being tri force, or in accordance with any custom or usage permitting of divorce after six months from the date of such final order, or from the date on which the marriage was dissolved in accordance with the custom or usage. Provision was also made in Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of that Act for punishing Under Section 494 or 495, IPC a party to such a void marriage as It is bigamous.Padullaparthi Mutyala Paradeshi vs Padullaparthi Subbalakshmi And ... on 3 August, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1632111/ 3","['17', '4', '5', '11', '7']"

This is a letters patent appeal by the original petitioner-husband against the decree of Mr. Justice Gatne in appeal confirming the decree of the City Civil Court. Bombay, dismissing his petition for divorce and raises a point of importance and interest arising out of judicial separation, namely, whether desertion by a spouse on which ground a decree for judicial separation was passed in favour of the original petitioner spouse under Section 10(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act) continues unless the original respondent spouse makes efforts to resume cohabitation and constitutes a wrong which would disentitle the spouse so failing to get the relief of divorce on ground of non-resumption of cohabitation, and involves construction of Sections 10(2), 13(1A), 23(1)(a) of the Act. 2. The facts are not in dispute. The appellant is the husband and was married to the respondent wife according to Hindu FDIC rites on Dec. 16, 1956 at Bombay. They lived together for about 5 months at Thana till May 1957 when the wife left the husband and continued to live separately from him. On April 26, 1961 the wife filed Miscellaneous Petition No.1526 of 1961 in the City Civil Court at Bombay for judicial separation on the grounds of desertion, cruelty and adultery. The husband filed his written-statement denying the said allegations. In November 1963 when the suit came up for hearing the wife did not press her allegations of cruelty and adultery and the husband did not contest the suit on the remnant ground of desertion and the Court passed a decree for judicial separation on the ground of desertion. No attempt was made for reconciliation between the parties and on March 10, 1968 the husband filed M. Petition No.1735 of 1968 against the wife in the Bombay City Civil Court for divorce on the ground of non-resumption of cohabitation under Section 13(1A)(i) of the Act. At the hearing of the suit on the 12th October 1968 the husband gave evidence and categorically stated that he made no attempt to see or meet the wife because the parties were separated by the decree of judicial separation. The wife did not examine herself or led any evidence. On this evidence the learned trial Judge dismissed the petition observing that Judge dismissed the petition observing that husband's explanation for not making any attempt to take back his wife did not help him and he had committed a wrong within the meaning of section 23(1)(a) of the Act. On appeal to this Court by the husband Mr. Justice Gatne confirmed the decree on the same ground on October 12, 1971. The husband has now preferred this appeal against the said decision. 3. Mr. Rele for the appellant-husband has assailed the decree on two grounds, first the amended Section 13(1A), which confers an absolute and unqualified right on either party to obtain divorce on ground of non-resumption of cohabitation for a period of two or more years after the passing of a decree for judicial separation is not subject to or controlled by Section 23 of the Act and, therefore, the question of the husband having committed a wrong or taking advantage thereof for his present petition within Section 23(1) does not arise; and secondly, that even if Section 23(1) applies, the husband was under no duty after judicial separation to take steps for resuming co-habitation and,Jethabhai Ratanshi Lodaya vs Manabai Jethabhai Lodaya on 6 April, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1107018/ 1therefore, his omission to do so did not amount to a desertion and, therefore, not a wrong within the meaning of the said Section 23(1)(a). Mr. Thacker for the wife has contested the above propositions and supports the judgment of the Court below. It is obvious that if the appellant succeeds on either of his above contentions the appeal will have to be allowed. 4. Before dealing with the first point, it will be convenient to notice the amendments made in Section 13 of the Act. section 13(1) as it originally stood contained nine clauses specifying various grounds of divorce. Clauses (viii) and (ix) provided for a divorce on the ground that the other party: (viii) has not resumed co-habitation for a space of two years or upwards after the passing of the decree."" By the Amending Act No.44 of 1964, which came into force on December 20, 1964. clauses (viii) and (ix) were deleted from sub-section (1) and in their place a new sub-section (1A) was introduced in section 13. The new sub-section (1A) reads. ""Either party to a mortgage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage of divorce on the ground- (i) That there was has been no resumption of co-habitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they were parities: or (ii) that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights as between the parties to the marriage for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of a proceeding to which they were parities"". By the amendment a very conspicuous change is made and the right to get divorce is conferred on either of the spouses, whereas under the old clauses (viii) and (ix) only the petitioner. On whose application the decree for judicial separation was passed could get divorcee and to this extent . no doubt the law is liberalised. Mr. Rele, however. Contends that there is a further change made and it is this; while both the grounds under the said old clauses involved an element of default on other party. namely in not resuming cohabitation in one case and in failure to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights in the other under the new grounds in the sub-section (1A) no such consideration arises as only objective conditions on non-resumption of jugal rights are laid down. He urges that this change in the conditions of grounds necessarily implies at least. after the said amendments that section 23(1) of the Act does not govern the proceedings for divorce under Section 13(1A). Now, there is no doubt that the grounds in clauses (i) and (ii) of the new sub-section (1A) lay down purely objective tests and involves no dereliction of duty or wrong. further , it does not appear that there was any element of default in the ground under old clause (viii) though the words ""failed to suggested it. Further. as discussed later a decree of judicial separation makes it cohabit with the other and therefore spelling out any element of default from the old clause (viii) would have run counter to the said consequence of judicial separation. Further. Mr. Rele cited an authority of Jammu and Kashmir High court in Tej Kour v. Hakim Singh (AIR 1965 J and K 111) in connection with his other point and which is refereed more fully later wherein it was held that under the old ground (viii) there was no condition or limitation to grant divorce once two or more years hadJethabhai Ratanshi Lodaya vs Manabai Jethabhai Lodaya on 6 April, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1107018/ 2passed after the passing more years had passed after the passing of the decree for judicial separation. But even apart from this alleged change in the old and new grounds for divorce, appellant's arguments ignores the express provisions of Section 23. Even if any one or more of the grounds for divorce exist a decree for divorce will not automatically follow as the Court has to satisfy itself under Section 23 about certain conditions before granting the relief asked for, Section 23 reads as follows:- ""(1) In any proceedings under this Act, whether defended or not, if the Court is satisfied that - (a) any of the grounds for granting relief exists and the petitioner is not in any way taking advantage of his or her own wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief, and (b) any of the ground of the petition is the ground specified in clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 10, or in clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 13. the petitioner has not in any manner been accessory to or connived at or condoned the act or acts complained of , or where the ground of the petition is cruelty the petitioner has not in any manner condoned the cruelty, and (c) the petition is not presented or prosecuted in collusion with the respondent, and (d) there has not been any unnecessary or improper delay in instituting the proceeding, and (e) there is no other legal ground why relief should not be granted. then, in such a case, but not otherwise, the Court shall decree such relief accordingly. (2) Before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court in the first instance, in every case where it is possible so to do consistently with the nature and circumstances of the case, to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties"". 5. It is obvious from the above provisions that it is the duty of the Court to satisfy that certain requirements are complied with before granting the relief in a proceeding under the Act. In sub-section (1) the opening words ""in any proceedings"" and later the words ""in such a case but not otherwise"" are very material. In a recent decision of this Court in Laxmibai v. Laxmichand Chandrachud J. had to consider the question, whether Section 23 applies to petition for divorce on the ground of non-restitution of conjugal rights under clause (ii) of Section 13(1A). In that case the wife had obtained a decree of restitution of conjugal rights. After a lapse of two years the husband filed a petition for divorce on the ground that there was no restitution of conjugal rights under clause (ii) of Section 13(1A). The wife contended that the petitioner husband had failed to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights which amounted to a wrong within clause (a) of Section 23(1). The husband sought to meet that argument by contending. as has been done, by the husband in the present case, that the provisions of Section 13(1A) were not subject to Section 23(1) of the Act. After considering the effect of the amendments made in 1964, the learned Judge observed -Jethabhai Ratanshi Lodaya vs Manabai Jethabhai Lodaya on 6 April, 1973 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1107018/ 3","['13', '23', '10']"

The constitutional validity of Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 (for short ""the Act"") which regulated divorce among Christians in India for a century and a quarter is directly under challenge in the two Original Petitions at the instance of two Christian women on the ground that the provisions in Section 10 are violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to them and other similarly situated Christian women under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 2. Mary Sonia Zachariah, petitioner in O. P. No. 5805 of 1988 is a Syrian Christian governed by the Act. At the time of filing the O, P. she was aged 36 and was working as an Asst. Warden at Corpus Christi School, Kottayam. She was married to one P,C. Zachariah on 6-1-1972 at Emmanual Mar-thoma Church, Pazhanni, Thrissur according to the customary rites and ceremonies of the church. A daughter, Elizabeth Zachariah alias Kittu was born out of the said wedlock on 16-9-1974. On the basis of Exts. P3 and P 4 letters the petitioner has specifically pleaded that her husband has taken an irreversible decision to live with an English lady whom he met while in Nairobi where he was employed from 1977 onwards, deserting the petitioner and her child once and for all. Petitioner has specifically alleged that from 1978 onwards her husband has deserted her and has not cared to cohabit with her or to perform any of the marital obligations and to maintain her and her daughter. She has further alleged in the petition that she is not even aware of the whereabouts of her husband at present. 3. Originally, Union of India, State of Kerala and the husband of the petitioner alone were impleaded as parties to the O. P. Later certain individuals, association of persons, cultural and social institutions such as Suhruth, Reg. No. 404/ 88, Kottayam, Kerala Manila Samajam, Vazhuthacaud, Trivandrum, Jonakiya Vimochana Viswas Prasthanam belonging to the Central Kerala CSI, Diocese YMCA of Bombay; Indian Federation of Women Lawyers, Kerala Branch, Christian Institute for the study of Religion and Society, Poulose Mar Poulose, Bishop, Church of East in his capacity as Chairperson, World Student Christian Federation, Fr.

Bishop Poulose Mar Poulose was also present in Court and in his behalf Fr. K. V. Poulose has submitted that Bishop also supports the prayers in the two O.Ps. 4. Ammini E. J., petitioner in O. P. No. 4319 of 1991 is also a Christian governed by the Act. At the time of filing the O. P. the petitioner was aged 39 and was working as a High School Assistant at the Government High School, Pattambi. She was married to the third respondent on 14-2-1980 at St. Peter St. Paul Church, Amaravathy, Kochi, according to the rites, ceremonies and customs of theAmmini E.J. And Etc. vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 24 February, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1591531/ 1said church. According to the petitioner they lived together as husband and wife till 18-7-1981 and thereafter the third respondent has deserted her with the intention of abandoning her permanently against her wish. It is her further case that during the period they lived together as husband and wife, the third respondent's conduct towards the petitioner was very cruel and he had subjected the petitioner to insults, abuses and accusations of adulterous conduct even in the presence of public, her colleagues, students and relatives. She has alleged that the desertion, insults, abuses and accusations of adulterous conduct and threats of physical violence had made the continuance of the married life impossible. Before filing of this O. P., petitioner has filed O. P. No. 153 of 1985 before the District Court, Thrissur under Section 22 of the Act for a decree of judicial separation on the ground of cruelty and desertion of the third respondent. As per Ext. PI judgment in O. P. No. 153 of 1985 dated 28-7-1988, the Addl. District Judge has specifically found that the third respondent is guilty of cruelty and desertion and has grafted a decree for judicial separation as prayed for. Petitioner has alleged that in spite of the lapse of more than two years there has no been resumption of cohabitation and there is not even an iota of chance for reconciliation. Petitioner has further alleged that even though there is no chance of reconciliation, it may not be possible for her to get a divorce since desertion and cruelty are not recognised as grounds for divorce unless adultery is also alleged and proved by her. It is in the circumstances that the petitioner has also challenged the constitutional validity of Section 10 of the Act. 5. The other material allegations, contentions and reliefs prayed for in the O. Ps. are more or less same or similar and are briefly thus: Indian women of all religions other than Christianity are entitled to get divorce on grounds of cruelty and/ or desertion which are recognised as independent grounds for divorce under the respective enactments applicable to them. For Christians who are governed by the Act, cruelty and desertion are not by themselves independent grounds for divorce. To be grounds for divorce, adultary should also be alleged and proved along with cruelty or desertion as far as Christians governed by the Act are concerned. As adultary is often committed with calculated care and utmost secrecy, direct proof of adultery is very difficult. Under the Indian social set up it is well nigh impossible for a woman to prove adultery of her husband. This renders the provisions for divorce virtually infructuaus for a woman. The requirement of proving adultery along with cruelty and desertion to make out a ground for divorce under Section 10 of the Act violates the petitioners' fundamental right to equality and right to live with dignity and personal liberty enshrined in Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Denial of Divorce on the ground of cruelty or desertion without reasonable excuse for a period of two years or upwards which are grounds for divorce for all Indians of all other religions except Christians is discrimination based solely on the ground of religion. While Section 10 confers on the husband a right to get divorce on proof of adultery simpliciter the wife is obliged to prove either cruelty or desertion along with adultery to get a divorce. This again is a discrimination based solely on sex which makes the provision constitutionally bad. In support of the contentions raised in the O. Ps., the petitioners have referred to the relevant provisions in all other enactments dealing with divorce in force in India and some of the Acts in force in England and the various recommendations made by the Law Commission of India from time to time as part of the pleadings in the O.Ps.Ammini E.J. And Etc. vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 24 February, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1591531/ 26. The petitioners have thus contended that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it makes adultery also necessary to be established along with cruelty and desertion as a ground for divorce is arbitrary, authoritarian and violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 7. The petitioner in O. P. No. 5805 of 1988 has further contended that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it incorporates the word 'incestuous' before the word 'adultery' thereby making in aggravated form of adultery alone as a ground for divorce for Christian woman whereas all other Indians including Christian men are entitled to get divorce on the ground of adultery simpliciter is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 8. The substantive reliefs prayed for in the two O.Ps. can be summarised thus: (1) to declare that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it incorporates the word 'incestuous' before the word 'adultery' the words 'adultery coupled with' occurring before 'such cruelty as without adultery would have entitled her to a divorce a mensa et toro' and 'desertion without reasonable excuse for two years or upwards' is violative of Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India, and (2) to declare that 'adultery', 'such cruelty as without adultery would have entitled to a divorce mensa et toro' and 'desertion without reasonable excuse for two years or upwards' are grounds for dissolution of marriage for a wife under the Act. 9. Union of India has filed a counter affidavit opposing the reliefs prayed for in the O.Ps. and raising mainly the following contentions. Though the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, following which the Act was framed has undergone various drastic changes, the Act has remained in force unchanged till date. In spite of repeated recommendations made by the Law Commission of India for amending the law regarding marriage and divorce among Christians, Government was not able to undertake any legislations to amend the law in view of the strong opposition from the community itself. So far the constitutionality of the provisions contained in Section 10 of the Act has been upheld by various courts including the Supreme Court whenever such challenge had been made in the past. Different personal laws are applicable to different communities in India. The debates of the constituent Assembly relating to Article 35 of the draft constitution corresponding to Article 44 of the constitution leave no scope for doubt with regard to the fact that the constitution makers envisaged the continuance of personal laws applicable to different communities for quite sometime, if not indefinitely. Only by legislation amendment can be brought to the provisions in the Act, So long as such pre-consti-tutional personal laws are not changed by the legislature, such laws are protected by Article 13 of the Constitution of India. While changing a personal law like the Act, Government have necessarily to take into account the readiness of the community to accept reforms. So far the community has not expressed its readiness to accept the reforms proposed to the personal law governing marriage and divorce among Christians. As regards the scope of judicial intervention by Court, it has been consistently held by all the Courts that Section 10 of the Act specifically sets forth the grounds on which the marriage can be dissolved and no additional grounds can be included by judicial construction of similar provisions in other enactments unless the section plainly comprehends such grounds. No parallel can be drawn between the personal laws relating to one community and another community for making a ground of discrimination. Grounds for divorce are bound to differ from one law to the other depending upon the community to which it concerns. TheAmmini E.J.

Nor can it be said that in a proceeding under Section 13(1)(i) of HM Act, when the spouse and alleged adulterer are impleaded as respondents, the alleged adulterer is improperly joined as a Respondent. Therefore the alleged adulterer will be a proper party to a proceedings under Section 13(1)(i) of HM Act. The Family Court and the Learned Single Judge merely concentrated on the fact no relief was sought against the Second Respondent. They therefore considered only whether the adulterer is a necessary party to a petition seeking divorce on the ground of adultery, but completely ignored that the alleged adulterer is a proper party. JUDGMENT R.V. Raveendran, J. 1. The appellant and first respondent are respectively the husband and wife. The appellant filed M.C. No. 521 of 2000 before the Family Court, Bangalore under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 praying that a decree for divorce against the first respondent with costs and such other reliefs the Court may deem fit in the circumstances of the case. He impleaded the alleged adulterer (second respondent herein) as second respondent in M.C. No. 521 of 2000. 2. Second respondent filed I.A. No. IV under Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the CPC to delete him from the petition. Second respondent contended that no relief has been sought against him. He also contended that the Hindu Marriage (Karnataka) Rules, 1956 do not contemplate or require that the alleged adulterer should be impleaded as a respondent in a proceedings under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Therefore, he submitted that he is neither & proper party nor a necessary party. 3. Appellant resisted the said application on the ground that the petition being one under Section 13(1)(i) for divorce, the adulterer is a necessary and proper party to the petition. The Family Court, by order dated 4-4-2001 allowed I.A. No. IV and directed the petitioner (appellant herein) to delete the second respondent. The Family Court held that appellant had not sought any relief against the second respondent and therefore he is neither a necessary nor a proper party to the proceedings. 4. Feeling aggrieved, appellant filed W.P. No. 23138 of 2001 (GM-FC), DD: 31-8-2001 (Arun Kumar Agarwal v. RadhaArun and Anr.). The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition by order dated 31-8-2001. He noticed that several High Courts have framed rules under Sections 14 and 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, requiring the adulterer to be made as a party to proceedings under Section 13(1)(i), that the Karnataka Rules do not contain such a provision and suggested that Karnataka High Court should also frame a specific rule for impleading adulterer as a party. He was of the view that in the absence of such a rule in Karnataka, an adulterer cannot be impleaded as a party, unless some relief was sought against him. Feeling aggrieved, appellant has filed this appeal. The question that therefore arises for consideration is whether a person impleaded as a co-respondent in a petition under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, as alleged adulterer, can seek deletion on the ground that no relief is sought against him. 5. The appellant who appears in person contends that in the absence of any rules, the question whether a person is a necessary or proper party will have to be decided with reference to the provisions of Rules 3, 5, 7 and 10 of Order 1 of the CPC. He submitted that the principles relating toArun Kumar Agarwal vs Radha Arun And Anr. on 12 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784934/ 2impleading of parties make it clear that an adulterer is a proper, if not necessary party to a proceedings under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act. He submits that if there was a rule in the Hindu Marriage (Karnataka) Rules, 1956, requiring a petitioner in a petition under Section 13(1)(i) to implead an adulterer, then the adulterer would have been a necessary party; and in the absence of such a rule, the adulterer is a proper party and the petition has the option of either impleading or not impleading him. It is contended that once the petitioner chooses to implead as a co-respondent, the person who according to him is the adulterer, he being a proper party, cannot be deleted at the instance of such respondent, under Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the CPC. 6. Section 13(1)(i) provides that any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party has, after solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse. A petition under Section 13(1)(i) necessarily therefore involves an allegation of voluntary sexual intercourse by the spouse with a third party. Where such adulterer is named in the petition and evidence is let in to show that the spouse had intercourse with such person, the Court will have to record a finding that the spouse had voluntary sexual intercourse with such named person. There is no gainsaying that such a finding/decision will adversely affect the reputation of the person who is alleged to have committed the adulterous act. Public interest and principles of natural justice require that the person concerned should have an opportunity to defend his reputation before such a finding is recorded. It is precisely for this reason that Rules framed by several High Courts (Allahabad, Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Chennai, Orissa, Patna, Punjab and Rajasthan) specifically require that the alleged adulterer should be impleaded as a co-respondent in a petition under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, even though no relief may be claimed against him. We strongly commend amendment of the Hindu Marriage (Karnataka) Rui.es, 1956, to introduce such a provision. As observed by a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court in Sikha Singh v. Dina Chakrabarty and Ors., the rule requiring joinder of the adulterer as a co-respondent proceeds on a public policy to prevent collusion and character assassination. 7. But what if the rules do not require the impleading of the alleged adulterer as co-respondent, though named in the petition? In the absence of any rule, we have to fall back upon Rules 3, 5 and 10(2) of Order 1 of the CPC. Rule 3 provides that all persons against whom any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act/s or transaction/s is alleged to exist, whether jointly or severally or in the alternative, may be joined as defendants in a suit. Rule 5 makes it clear that it shall not be necessary that every defendant shall be interested as to all the relief claimed in any suit against them. Rule 10(2) inter alia provides that the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, order that the name of any party improperly joined as defendant be struck out; or order the addition of any person who ought to have been joined as defendant, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectively and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit. 8. A plaintiff or petitioner is bound to implead all those who are 'necessary parties'. He is also entitled to or at liberty to implead in a suit all parties who are 'proper parties'. Though these terms are not defined in the Code, it is well-settled that persons who ought to have been joined, that isArun Kumar Agarwal vs Radha Arun And Anr. on 12 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784934/ 3",['13']

This is an appeal filed by the appellant/ petitioner, who, filed a petition under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for a declaration that there was no marriage between her and the respondent under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956 and that the purported registration under Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act dated 26th December, 1987 was a nullity. The Suit filed by her was dismissed by the learned District Judge, 13th Court, Alipore by an order and Judgment dated 19th January, 1990 passed in Matrimonial Suit No. 19 of 1988: 2. The case of the appellant/petitioner in short may be stated as follows : The appellant was a student of B.A. Class in Vidyasagar College, Calcutta and the respondent was also a student of B.Sc Class in the said College and that during their study .in the said College, the appellant/petitioner and the respondent developed, a friendly relation between them and that the appellant/petitioner mixed with the respondent in free mind while the respondent cherished a desire to marry the petitioner. The parents of the appellant/petitioner arranged for her marriage and the date for blessing ceremony (Ashirbad) was fixed on 25th November, 1987. 3. It is the case of the appellant/petitioner that the appellant had invited the respondent in the said ceremony which was scheduled to be held on 25th November 1987, but on 24th November, 1987 the respondent called the appellant/petitioner over telephone to his residence and when the appellant/ petitioner went to his residence the respondent confined the petitioner/appellant 'in his house against her will. The guardian of the appellant/petitioner after thorough search with the help of the local people, rescued the appellant/petitioner from the residence of the respondent on 26th November 1987, It is also stated that the respondent took the appellant/petitioner to a Marriage Registration Office on 26th November 1987 and under pressure, threat and coercion compelled her to put her signature in the form and got the marriage registration - certificate on the basis of false statement to the effect that the marriage was already solemnised. It is also stated that one unknown person represented as brother of the appellant/petitioner and signed the said form for registration of the said alleged marriage. The signatories of the said form were the men of the respondent. It is stated that there was no marriage at all on 24th November 1987 under the Hindu Marriage Act between the parties. ]t is further stated that the signature of the appellant/petitioner was obtained under influence and coercion in the said form, but the statements recorded in the register of marriage were not at all correct. It is stated that after being released from the clutches of the respondent, she procured the marriage registration certificate and after perusing the same she filed the instant suit, for a declaration that the marriage registration was a nullity as there had been no marriage at all under the law.Mousumi Chakraborty vs Subrata Guha Roy on 7 February, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1827868/ 14. The case of the respondent was that he has friendly relation with the appellant/petitioner and he never talked or proposed for marriage to the appel- lant/petitioner and that he had never detained the appellant in his house. According to the respondent their marriage as per Hindu rites took place in Kali Temple at Kalighat, Calcutta on 24th November, 1987. Thereafter, the appellant/petitioner and the respondent went to Ranaghat, a place far away from the city, with their common friends, namely Dilip Pal, Prabir Das and others for consumating the marriage and on 26th November 1987 they all returned to Calcutta and on the same date, the appellant and the respondent got their marriage registered before the Marriage Registrar of Alipore, Calcutta. It was stated that the marriage between them were duly performed and the registration certificate was signed and witnessed by the common friends of both of them. It was stated that the said marriage was an outcome of mutual love and understanding ""between them. In support of the respondent's case the respondent exhibited certain letters written by the appellant and some photographs. It was stated that after registration of marriage, the appellant/petitioner was sent back to her house and that from there she had not returned to the matrimonial home. It was further stated that thereafter the respondent with his elder brother went to take ""back the appellant, but the appellant's family members rudely behaved with them and insulted them. the respondent further claimed that they had co-habited at Ranaghat as husband and wife. 5. The Trial Court on the basis of the evidence and documents produced before the Court came to the conclusion that the appellant was eager to marry the respondent and the appellant was in deep love with the respondent and that a photograph was produced before the Trial Court in which it appeared that the appellant/petitioner and the respondent were sitting as newly married couple in a Baarghar. It also appeared from the photograph that the appellant and the respondent was sitting having vermilion in the forehead , of them appellant and Shankha in her hands and both of them were garlanded. Considering all these love letters and photograph and other materials on record, the Trial Court was of the view that there was no fraud or coercion on the part of the respondent as alleged by the appellant. It was further held that the marriage between the appellant and the respondent was held on consent of the appellant and the respondent. But the mother of the appellant did not know about the intimacy of the appellant and the Respondent. The learned Judge held that the marriage registration certificate was conclusive proof of marriage and accordingly held that the appellant was not entitled to get relief as prayed for and accordingly, the suit was dismissed. 6. Mr. Sanjay Bhattacharjee learned Advocate appearing with Mrs. Chandrima Bhattacharjee, learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant/petitioner contended that there was no valid marriage between the appellant and the respondent and that the marriage registration certificate is not a conclusive proof of marriage inasmuch as, marriage registration under Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act is a mere recording of the marriage after the marriage has been solemnised under the provision of the said Act as required udder the law for the purpose of faciliting the proof of the marriage. It was further submitted that the ceremonies for a Hindu Marriage were essential for a valid Hindu Marriage and unless ceremonies of Hindu Marriage have been observed, mere registration under the Act cannot go to show that there was a valid marriage.Mousumi Chakraborty vs Subrata Guha Roy on 7 February, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1827868/ 27. In this contention, Mr. Bhattacharjee submitted that true there was some intimacy between the parties and that the appellant had written several love-letters but love-letters written by a girl did not prove that there was a valid marriage. Similarly, producing a photograph in which the appellant appears to be standing by the side of the respondent cannot be said to be conclusively proof of their marriage. The essential rites which are required for a valid marriage are ""(a) Invocation before the sacred fire, and (b) Saptapadi,"" which have admittedly not taken place in the instant case. If the ceremonies for Hindu Marriage Act laid down in Section 7 of the Act had not been performed, mere registration, exchange of love letters and producing of photograph are not conclusive proof for holding that a valid marriage took place under the law. 8. In this connection, it appears from the deposition of the respondent that he had attended many Hindu Marriage ceremonies; but he did not notice the ceremony performed at the time of Hindu Marriage and that he had no knowledge regarding the ceremonies, those were required to be performed in the Hindu Marriage. In his deposition the respondent stated that his father knows about the ceremonies which were held in the Hindu Marriages and some of his friends were present at the time of marriage and those friends would depose regarding the marriage at Kalighat. In his deposition the respondent had specifically Stated that the said marriage took place under Special Marriage Act and that the same was a registered marriage. 9. Respondent's father, D.W. No. 1, Dilip Kumar Guha Roy in his deposition also stated that the marriage between Subrata and Mousumi was a registered marriage under Special Marriage Act, and further stated that in the evening of 26.11.87 after returning home he found Subrata with Mousumi having mark of vermilion and Sankha in hand and two or three friends of Subrata in his house. By seeing this at first he became excited, but some how he checked himself and then advised appellant Mousumi to go to her parents and inform them about the marriage and to obtain consent of Mousumi's parents. It was further stated by him that he and his family members tried to bring back the appellant, but the appellant did not turn up in their house. 10. One of the friends of the respondent Prabir Das in his deposition stated that the priest arranged everything for their marriage at Kalighat Temple and the priest recited mantras and stated""...........................,................ ..."" During cross-examination he stated that he had no knowledge regarding the ceremonies performed in Hindu Marriage, he stated that he did not know the address where the marriage took place, nor he know the name of the priest of the marriage. 11. Mr. Bhattacharjee also submitted that the case of the respondent that they went for staying at Ranaghat immediately after the marriage on 24th November, 1987, could not be believed at all, inasmuch as, the respondent in his deposition could not even tell the departure time of the train in which they had travelled from Calcutta to Ranaghat. The train number could not be remembered, but he could not tell even departure time of the train in which they travelled for going to Ranaghat. This clearly shows that the story of their going to Ranaghat and staying there, was false. Lastly Mr. Bhattacharjee submitted that the learned Judge had declared that there was a valid marriage, solely on the basis of the letters, photographs and the registration certificate, ignoring the fact that Hindu Marriage under the Act, must be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies. The appellant denied that she had any occasion to accompany the respondent at Kalighat for theMousumi Chakraborty vs Subrata Guha Roy on 7 February, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1827868/ 3","['8', '12', '7']"

Aspects of some significance touching proceedings instituted for dissolution of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 have arisen in these appeals, in which we have heard learned counsel extensively, which issues are summarized below : (a) Whether in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage while granting a relief under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the trial Court would be justified in the grant of ancillary orders in relation to items of property, such as the ornaments, furniture, fixtures etc., or whether on a strict construction of S. 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a Court would be required to direct the parties to adopt separate proceedings only in respect of these reliefs? (b) Where the Act is silent and it appears both reasonable and desirable that the reliefs in respect of property not covered by S. 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act be granted, whether the inherent powers under S. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure ought to be used? (c) Whether in a case of grant of permanent maintenance/alimony at the stage of final disposal of the petition the order can date back to the point of time of the institution of parallel matrimonial proceedings earlier instituted in the face of an interim order refusing the grant of maintenance in that case? (d) Whether the Court would be justified in refusing a litigant, who is alleged to have frustrated the resumption of cohabitation, the relief of divorce on the ground that the party is taking advantage of its own wrong? 2. These are some of the main facets of the dispute that has fallen for adjudication before us. We shall, to the extent necessary, summarise the history of this proceeding, which is rather unusual and which, in fact, encompasses three different matrimonial proceedings. The appellant-wife had instituted M. J. Petition No. 383 of 1986 before the City Civil Court at Bombay on 4-4-1986 praying for a decree for judicial separation as also for a direction that she be awarded maintenance at the rate of Rs. 1,050/- per month for her three children. The appellant-wife was gainfully employed at that time and did not pray for any maintenance for herself. This petition was preceded by an earlier petition, being M. J. Petition No. 662 of 1982, filed by the respondent-husband. He had sought a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. The parties are Hindus and were married at Bombay on 11-5-1969 according to the vedic rites and ceremonies. The couple had three children, the first of them being a son by the name Rajesh, the second being a daughter by the name Unnati and the third a son by the name of Suprasad. We arc not immediately concerned with the lengthy pleadings that are on record wherein the parties have traded a number of charges against each other. The reason for this is that the petition filed by the husband, wherein he alleged instances of cruelty which wereSangeeta Balkrishna Kadam vs Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam on 30 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72156/ 1denied by the appellant-wife was contested and the City Civil Court dismissed the petition with costs. It is relevant to point out that by virtue of a direction from the High Court, M. J. Petition No. 383 of 1986, which had been filed by the wife wherein she had prayed for a decree of judicial separation, was heard along with the husband's M. J. Pelition No. 662 of 1982 and the petilions were disposed of by a common judgment dated 21-4-1987. This aspect is of some relevance because Mr. Angal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-wife, has sought to advance a submission on the issue of maintenance, which will have some bearing on the fact that the two petitions came to be heard and disposed of through a common judgment. The City Civil Court at Bombay, while dismissing the husband's petition, decreed the wife's petition and she was granted a decree of judicial separation. The only relevant aspect of the matter that is of some consequence as far as the present proceeding is concerned is that, admittedly, after a short cohabitation lasting about three years, the wife left the matrimonial home on 16-8-1972. There a'rc references to some resumption of cohabitation in the course of the subsequent years on each of which occasion a situation arose whereby the parties again separated. At the time of the filing of the petition, admittedly, they were living apart. The City Civil Court at Bombay, while disposing of the two petitions on 21-4-1987, granted an ancillary relief whereby the appellant-wife was awarded maintenance in the sum of Rs. 600/- per month from the date of the decree as maintenance for the three children. 3. The present appellant filed First Appeal No. 15 of 1989 impugning the validity of the judgment and decree in question. This First Appeal came to be disposed of by judgment and order dated 11-6-1991 by our brother Patankar, J. The appeal was partly allowed and the respondent-husband was directed to pay maintenance from the date of the presentation of M. J. Petition No. 383 of 1986, i.e., from 4-4-1986 and not from the date of the decree. It was clarified that the maintenance at the rate of Rs. 200/- per month in respect of each of the children was to be paid till each of them attained majority, i.e., in the case of Rajcsh till 21-4-1988, in the case of Unnati till 6-12-1997 and in the case of Suprabhat till 5-7-1999. It is against this judgment and order that the present Letters Patent Appeal has been preferred. 4. The appellant-wife had canvassed before the learned single Judge two aspects of the matter which came to be turned down and it is her case that the learned single Judge was in error on both counts and that, consequently, she is entitled to corrective action. The first head that was canvassed on her behalf related to the date from which she was eligible for maintenance. It is her case that by virtue of the fact that the two proceedings were disposed of through a common judgment and by virtue of the fact that she had applied to the City Civil Court for the grant of maintenance in the earlier proceedings, namely, M. J. Petition No. 662 of 1982, that she ought to have been awarded maintenance on and from the date of the filing of that petition. In sum and substance, she contended that the learned single Judge, when he directed that the effective date from which she was eligible for maintenance ought to be the date of the presentation of her petition, namely 4-4-1986, had erred, and that he ought to have granted the maintenance from the date of the filing of the earlier petition, namely, 5-5-1982. The second contention or rather the main contention that was agitated by the appellant-wife concerned the rejection of the appellant-wife's prayer for the grant of an incidental relief or ancillary relief relating to her ornaments and certain items of property. Briefly stated, the appellant-wife contended that the respondent-husband had takenSangeeta Balkrishna Kadam vs Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam on 30 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72156/ 2charge of those items of jewellery which were referred to by her both in her written statement in reply to M. J. Petition No. 662 of 1982 as also by way of annexure to her own petition No. 383 of 1986. The trial Court had rejected this prayer and the learned single Judge also upheld this view, principally, on the ground that S. 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not invest the Court with the requisite jurisdiction to make an order in respect of these items of jewellery and other items of property because they did not come within the restrictive scope of Sec. 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The grievance of the appellant-wife is that the learned single Judge had misconstrued the provisions of S. 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that on the present record it was permissible for the Court to have directed the return of these items of property. This submission bases itself on the fact that the appellant-wife contends that there is overwhelming evidence on record to establish that this property belongs to her. that it has been wrongly taken charge of by the respondent-husband and that, consequently, the Court ought to pass a decree in her favour for the restoration of this property. We shall deal with the various arguments as also the propositions of law that were canvassed on either side presently. 5. It is essential at this stage for us to advert to another aspect of the matter which is intrinsically connected with the main dispute. As indicated by us earlier, the City Civil Court passed a decree for judicial separation in favour of the respondent-wife on 21-4-1987. Thereafter, since two years had elapsed since the passing of that decree, the husband filed M.J. Petition No 909 of 1988 before the Family Court at Bombay praying for a decree of divorce under S.13(1A)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act. No grounds were necessary for the grant of a decree in these proceedings in so far as it was the case of the petitioner-husband in that M. J. Petition that the period of two years having elapsed since the passing of the decree for judicial separation and since, admittedly, there was no resumption of cohabitation during this period, that he was entitled by law to a decree of divorce. This order was contested by the respondent-wife in that petition and we shall deal at a laler part of this judgment with those aspects of the proceedings which are also of some interest, apart from being of considerable importance. The wife in her written statement raised the plea that the husband was disqualified from the grant of any relief because he was taking advantage of his own wrong. The wife pointed out that it was her case that the husband was living in adultery with another woman and that as a result of this fact it had become impossible for the wife to resume cohabitation with him. She. therefore, contended that by preventing the resumption of matrimonial relationship and the continuance of her marriage with the husband, which had been ensured through the presence of a mistress in the house, the husband had committed a matrimonial wrong which disqualified him from any relief in the eye of the law. It is a subsidiary plea that the parties were not represented by lawyers in that proceeding as a result of which even though the wife desired to lead evidence before the Court in support of this contention of hers, that she was not afforded an opportunity of doing so and that, therefore, her defence was prejudiced. The Family Court, however, after hearing parlies, granted the husband a decree of divorce and it is against this judgment and orderdated 27-2-1991 that the wife preferred Family Court Appeal No. 27 of 1992. In so far as that proceeding is interconnected with the main Letters Patent Appeal, we have heard the two appeals together and propose to dispose of them through a common judgment. 6. We shall, first deal with the initial submission advanced by Mr. Angal, learned counsel representing the appellant-wife which concerns the maintenance issue.

Facts in brief necessary for disposal of this petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution are that petitioner/husband has filed a application under Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of the marriage solemnized between the petitioner/husband and respondent/wife. The proceedings have been registered as case no. 531 A/06 (HMA) and is pending before the Presiding Judge, Family Court, Gwalior. In the said proceedings, respondent/wife filed an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking maintenance pendente lite and expenses for the proceedings. In the application filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act respondent/wife claimed a sum of Rs. 2000/- per month as maintenance, a sum of Rs. 500/- as litigation expenses. It was her case that petitioner/husband is earning more than Rs. 15000/- per month. Apart from filing this application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act, respondent-wife also filed an application claiming maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. before the same Family Court which was registered as Misc. Cr. Case No. 647/2006. In this application also respondent-wife claimed a sum of Rs. 2,000/- as maintenance and Rs. 500/- as litigation expenses. Both these applications were decided by the same Presiding Officer of the Family Court on the same day i.e. 13.04.07 vide Annexure P/2 and Annexure P/3 respectively. In both these cases, learned Family Court has directed for payment of Rs. 1,000/- as maintenance and a sum of Rs. 500/- as litigation expenses. Inter alia contending that adjustment of the amounts granted by way of maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. is not granted while passing order on the application filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, an application was filed before the Family Court, the aforesaid application for adjustment having being dismissed vide order dated 10.10.07, Annexure P/1, petitioner is before this Court in this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, challenging the rejection of the application for adjustment of the maintenance granted in both the proceedings. 3. Shri R.K. Sharma, learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that respondent-wife was only entitled for one maintenance and when orders were passed by the Family Court on both the applications i.e. under Section 125 of Cr. P.C. so also under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, adjustment of the amount paid under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. should have been granted. In support thereof, he places reliance in the case of Narayani Rathore (Smt.) v. Ramesh Chandra Rathore 2003(II) M.P.W.N. [151] and also places reliance on a judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Sudeep Chaudhary v. Radha Chaudhary 2000(I)M. P.W. N. [119].Ashok Singh Pal vs Smt. Manjulata on 14 January, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62642/ 14. Refuting the aforesaid contentions, Shri Sarvesh Chouhan, learned Counsel for the respondent-wife submitted that the scope and object of the proceedings under Section 125 of Cr. P.C. and under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act are different and learned Court can grant relief in both these cases and in the present case learned Court having found entitlement of the respondent-wife to get benefit under both these provisions, passed the order on the same day and refused to grant adjustment. Shri Chouhan, argues that in doing so learned Court has not committed any error warranting interference in these proceedings under Article 227 of the Constitution. 5. Having heard learned Counsel for the parties and on consideration of the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that of Section 125 of Cr. P.C., it is seen that remedies available to an aggrieved person under both these Sections are quite independent. Rejection of application under Section 125 of Cr. P.C. is not a bar for granting maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 6. The Rajasthan High Court and the Bombay High Court in the cases of Virendra Kumar v. Santosh Devi 1988 {1} HLR 373 and Alka v. Vardhaman 2001 {1} HLR 138 have held that Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is a provision for granting temporary alimony to either the wife or to the husband as the case may be in a proceedings pending before the Court under the Hindu Marriage Act. An application can be filed by either of the spouse seeking interim maintenance in a pending proceedings. The court where the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act is pending gets jurisdiction under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act as soon as the proceedings are instituted. The benefit granted in a proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is purely temporary in nature, which has effect till the proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act are concluded. The question as to whether during the pendency period of a order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, benefit under Section 125 Cr.P.C. can also be granted, is considered by the Andra Pradesh High Court in the case of Royendra Singh v. Maya Devi 1996 II DMC 362 {AP}, the Punjab High Court in the case of Satish v. Surjit Singh 1977 Punj. 383 HLR and in the case of Jagadish Kumar v. Neelam Rani 1988 {1} HLR 407 wherein it has been held that an order granting maintenance under Section 488, old Cr.P.C. does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court to order maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Further, it has been held by the Gujrat, Punjab and Haryana and Andra Pradesh High Courts in the cases of Ramesh Chandra v. Dhiraj Gowri 1982 HLR 455 {Guj}, Devinder Kumar v. Asha Rani 1988 {2} HLR 452 {P & H} and Yedukondalu v. Vallabhaneni Nageswaramma 2000 {2} HLR 324 {AP}, that a application for temporary alimony under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not a bar merely because an application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is also allowed. 7. That being so, it is seen that the consistent view of various Courts have been that both the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. can be invoked seeking maintenance and alimony pendente lite by either of the spouse. However, a bench of this Court in the case of Deepak Shukla v. Savita Shukla 1999 {2} HLR 631 has held that court can grant adjustment of the amount determined in a proceedings under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. while deciding the question of granting alimony pendente lite in a proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Grant of adjustment, therefore, is a matter to be decided by the court after considering the facts and circumstances of each case and on consideration of the question ofAshok Singh Pal vs Smt. Manjulata on 14 January, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/62642/ 2maintenance claimed and granted in the proceedings. 8. After relying on a judgment of the Gujrat High Court in the case of Hansa Ben v. Ramesh Kumar reported in 1992 Cr.L.J. 3688, a Bench of this Court in the case of Naresh Kumar Rai v. Smt. Mamta Rai and Anr. 2003{2} M.P.L.J. 137 has held as under: 5. ...that the nature of proceedings under Hindu Marriage Act, and that of maintenance proceedings under Code of Criminal Procedure, are different and hence a wife can pursue both the remedies simultaneously. It is also found explained that the amount of maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, cannot be set of against the alimony awarded under a different proceedings and order of maintenance under Section 125 of the Code, can only be modified, altered or set aside under Section 125(4),(5) and/or under Section 127 of the Code.... 9. It is in the back drop of these provisions that the question involved in this petition is to be considered. In the present case, it has to be taken note of that both the orders under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. and under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act are passed by the same court on the same day and the court was aware of the pendency of one proceedings while deciding the other and after considering the pleadings, granted maintenance. When the application for adjustment was filed, learned court has rejected the same and it has been held that the amount of the maintenance granted need not to be adjusted as maintenance is properly granted in both the proceedings after considering the totality of the circumstances. 10. The Supreme Court in the case of Sudhip Choudhary (supra) relied upon by Shri R.K. Sharma, learned Counsel for the petitioner, does not say that the amount of maintenance granted should be adjusted, it only says that maintenance amount may be adjusted. In the case of Narayani Rathore (supra) after considering the grant of maintenance made, this Court found that amount of maintenance granted under Section 125 Cr.P.C. should be adjusted while considering the question of maintenance and simultaneously adjustment was granted, however, this was so held considering the financial condition of the respondent and the amount of maintenance already granted under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. The principal laid down in all the cases are that maintenance may be granted and the question as to whether the adjustment is to be granted or not, is a discretion exercised by the court concerned before whom the adjustment is sought after considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of each case. There is nothing under the law that is brought to the notice of this Court which lays down as a mandatory requirement the principle for grating adjustment or deducting the amount maintenance or alimony granted in a proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C. or under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act or vice- versa. The principle laid down is that maintenance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. and alimony pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act can be claimed by resorting to both these provisions and the court is competent under these provisions to grant relief to the person concerned and the question of adjustment to be granted, has to be decided after taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, the amount granted and the capacity of the person directed for making the payment. There is nothing to suggest that as a thumb-rule adjustment to the amount is to be granted in each and every case.Ashok Singh Pal vs Smt.

279,"Calcutta High Court Uma Charan Roy vs Sm. Kajal Roy on 1 September, 1970 Equivalent citations: AIR 1971 Cal 307, 75 CWN 303 Author: S Chakravarti Bench: S Chakravarti, S Datta JUDGMENT S.K. Chakravarti, J. 1. This is an appeal at the instance of a husband against whom a decree of nullity of his marriage with the respondent has been passed by a learned Additional District Judge at Alipore. The appellant seems to be rather unfortunate in his matrimonial ventures. He was first married with one Durga Bala Roy in or about 1947, and on the 2nd of October, 1958. Durga EaJa died leaving five issues. In less than three and half months from the date of the death of Durga Bala the appellant married again one Susama, to be precise, on the 15th of January, 1959. On the 11th of September, 1963. he filed a suit for dissolution of his marriage with Susama on the ground that she had been suffering from venereal disease in a communicable form for a period of not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. It would further appear that before this suit was filed he and the present respondent Kajal fell in love with each other. The suit for dissolution of the marriage was decreed on the 23rd of March, 1964, under Section 13(1)(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act (Ext. B). Admittedly the appellant Susama as also Kajal are all Hindus. On the 18th of March, 1964, that is to say five days before the appellant got his decree of divorce of the marriage with Susama he filed a notice of marriage with Kajal before the Marriage Officer for Calcutta and 24 Parganas District (Ext. 2). On the 21st of April, 1964, the appellant and Kajal were married under the Special Marriage Act and exhibit 3 is the certificate of marriage. On the 17th of June, 1964. Kajal filed the instant suit mainly on the allegation that her marriage with the appellant was void as the appellant's marriage with Susama was continuing upto the date of the marriage or, in other words, as her marriage with the appellant contravened the provision of Clause (a) of Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act. She had also made allegations in her petition that by fraud and misrepresentation she was induced to enter into this form of marriage and she was actually not aware of the fact that the appellant had a wife living on that date. But the appellant contested that suit and denied these charges of fraud and misrepresentation and further alleged that Kajal was aware of everything and that as a matter of fact it was she who induced him to enter into this marriage. He further contended that in no view of the law could Susama be considered as his spouse on the date of his marriage with Kajal and as such the marriage was not a nullity. The learned Additional District Judge was of the opinion that in view of Clause (4) of Section 29 of the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not apply to the instant impugned marriage but he held that the marriage is bad in view of Section 30 of the Special Marriage Act and granted a decree of nullity. Hence this appeal by the husband. 2. The first point that is pressed by Mr. Himangshu Kumar Bose, the learned Advocate for the appellant, is to the effect that the learned Judge erred in applying Section 30 of the Special Marriage Act to this impugned marriage. In our view, he is quite justified in this criticism of the learned Judge's judgment. Section 30 of the Special Marriage Act, as it stands, would apply to the dissolution of a marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Here the marriage with Susama was dissolved, not under the Special Marriage Act, but under Section 13(1)(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act.Uma Charan Roy vs Sm. Kajal Roy on 1 September, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1918316/ 13. Mr. Amarendra Mohan Mitra, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent, however submits that Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act would also apply and that accordingly the marriage between the appellant and Susama must be deemed to be subsisting on the 21st of April. 1964, when the appellant and Kajal entered into a marriage under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act stands as follows:-- ""When a marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again: Provided that it shall not be lawful for the respective parties to marry again unless at the date of such marriage at least one year has elapsed from the date of the decree in the court of the first instance."" Mr. Mitra submits that the marriage between the appellant and Kajal was held before one year had elapsed from the date of the decree of dissolution of the marriage, namely, between the appellant and Susama, and as such it must be held that the appellant had a spouse living on the 21st of April, 1964, and his marriage with Kajal would be hit under Section 4(a) read with Section 24(1)(i) of the Special Marriage Act. 4. Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act runs as follows:-- ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force relating to the solemnization of marriages, a marriage between any two persons may be solemnized under this Act, if at the time of the marriage the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:- (a) neither party has a spouse living; (b) neither party is an idiot or a lunatic; (c) the male has completed the age of twenty-one years and the female the age of eighteen years; (d) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship; and (e) where the marriage is solemnized outside the territories to which this Act extends, both parties are citizens of India domiciled in the said territories."" Section 24(1) of the Special Marriage Act runs as follows:-- ""Any marriage solemnized under this Act shall be null and void and may be so declared by a decree of nullity if-Uma Charan Roy vs Sm. Kajal Roy on 1 September, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1918316/ 2(i) any of the conditions specified in Clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Section 4 has not been fulfilled; or (ii) the respondent was impotent at the time of the marriage and at the time of the institution of the suit."" 5. Prima facie the contention urged by Mr. Mitra is of substance. The term 'spouse' has not been defined either in the Hindu Marriage Act or in the Special Marriage Act and therefore has to be given its ordinary grammatical meaning. It means a wife or a husband. Therefore, if in law, the marriage between the appellant and Susama is held to be continuing up to 21st of April, 1964, the marriage between the appellant and Kajal would be null and void under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act referred to above. 6. Mr. Bose has very strenuously contended that in view of Section 29(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 15 of that Act has no application to the impugned marriage. Sub-section (4) of Section 29 runs as follows: ""Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect the provisions contained in the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (43 of 1954) with respect to marriages between Hindus solemnized under that Act, whether before or after the commencement of this Act."" 7. We are not in a position to accept this contention of Mr. Bose. Sub-section (4) of Section 29 can only mean that if there is any inconsistency between the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act and Special Marriage Act then the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to a marriage held under the Special Marriage Act. It does not mean that the effect of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would not apply in case one party to a marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act enters into a marriage with another person under the Special Marriage Act. 8. Mr. Bose has further contended that the term 'spouse' as used in Clause (a) of Section 4 would apply only to a spouse married under the Special Marriage Act. Or, in other words, his contention is to the effect that if a person has been married under the Special Marriage Act and then re-married under the Special Marriage Act, Clause (a) would apply, but not if the parties were married under the Hindu Marriage Act originally and later on one party to the marriage contracts the marriage under the Special Marriage Act. We see no reasons to limit the use of the term 'spouse' in Clause (a) of Section 4 to be a spouse married under the Special Marriage Act. We cannot read into this section something which is not there. Moreover, if we accept this interpretation of Mr. Bose it would lead to disastrous results. A person who is a Christian and has been married according to Christian rites, may, without dissolving his first marriage, get re-married with some other person under the Special Marriage Act, and, accordingly, if we accept Mr. Bose's interpretation that marriage would be valid. There are provisions similar to Clause (a) of Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act in the Hindu Marriage Act as also in other Acts. Conversely also a party to a marriage under the Special Marriage Act may choose to marry a Hindu under the Hindu rites, and if we follow Mr. Bose's interpretation, this second marriage cannot be questioned. Accordingly we do not accept this contention raised by Mr. Bose.Uma Charan Roy vs Sm.

CMPs, can be disposed of by a common judgment. 2. The petitioner is the wife, who filed both the petitions. She filed Tr.CMP No.216 of 1999 to transfer OS No.39 of 1998 pending on the file of Family Court, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, to the file of Family Court, Indore and Tr.CMP No.217 of 1999 is filed to transfer O.P. No. 201 of 1998 pending on the file of Family Court, City Civil Court, Hyderabad to the file of Family Court, Indore. The respondent-husband filed OP No.201 of 1998 for divorce and the suit OS No.39 of 1998 for permanent injunction. Both the matters are pending on the file of Family Court, Hyderabad. 3. Though the facts leading to the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was narrated at length, they are not necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue involved in these cases. As far as these petitions are concerned, the petitioner states that the marriage was solemnised between the petitioner and the respondent in the year 1996, OP was filed by the respondent-husband seeking divorce. It is also her case that she also filed a criminal case against the respondent and his family members which is pending in CC No.213 of 1998 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate, Indore. Similarly, CC No.13 of 1998 is also pending on the file of the said Court. It is also her case that her two brothers and her parents are residing separately and she is being looked alter by her aged parents and it would not be convenient to her to attend the Court at Hyderabad. That on a previous occasion when the petitioner attended the Court at Hyderabad, she was threatened with dire consequences by the respondent and some unsocial elements at the instance of the respondent, and therefore both the matters be transferred to the file of Family Court, at Indore in the interest of parties. 4. On the other hand, in the counter filed by the respondent-husband he has denied the averments made in the petitions seeking transfer of the cases from Hyderabad to Indore. It is also stated in the counter that the petitioner had only attended the Court once and the alleged threat of dire consequences was only a make belief averment and there was no substance in the contentions raised by the petitioner. It is also stated that the petitions are not maintainable as this Court has no jurisdiction to transfer the mailers to the Court under the jurisdiction of another High Court and the petitioner has to only approach the Supreme Court under Section 25 of CPC seeking such a transfer. 5. The undisputed facts are that the respondent-husband filed petitions for divorce and also a suit for injunction and both the cases are pending on the file of Family Court at Hyderabad, while the petitioner wife had also filed criminal cases against the respondent and his family members which are pending on the file of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore. 6. The main question that calls for consideration in this case is whether the case pending on the file of the Family Court, Hyderabad which are subordinate to this High Court can be transferred toMamta Gupta vs Mukund Kumar Gupta on 29 March, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1134791/ 1other Courts which are subordinate to other High Courts and any ground is made out for transfer of the case to the other Courts. 7. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that it is open for this Court to transfer the cases to the other Courts subordinate to the other High Courts and it is not necessary that the Court to which the cases are transferred need be subordinate to this High Court. Under Section 23 Civil Procedure Code power is vested with the High Court to transfer the cases to other High Courts. In support of his contention, he relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Western V.P. Electric Power Supply Company Ltd v. Hind Lamps Limited, (1969) II SCWR 16. He also submits that in cases relating to transfer of matrimonial matters the Courts have to take into consideration the economic soundness of either of the parties, social strata of the spouses and the behavioural pattern of their standard of life antecedent to marriage and such other relevant material as held by the learned single Judge of Karnataka High Court in Smt. Nanda Kishori v. S.B. Shivaprakash, AIR 1993 Kar 87. 8. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent Mr. C.B. Rammoham Reddy strenuously contends that no application would lie to this Court for transfer to the other Courts which are subordinate to the other High Courts. That power is available under Section 23(3) is taken away by Section 25 which came into effect from 1-2-1977 and the said power under Section 25 was held to be a wider power and therefore, after 1-2-1977 it is no more open for the High Court to transfer the cases to the other Courts under the jurisdiction of the other High Courts. He further submits that prior to substitution of Section 25, the Government was only having the power to transfer the cases from one High Court to another High Court, that too with certain limitations under the old Section 25. He heavily relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in Guda Vijayalakshmi v. Guda Ramachandra Sekhara Sastry, AIR 1981 SC 1143. He further submits that even though it is not directly related to Section 23(3) CPC and Section 25 CPC yet, the analogy is sufficient to constitute the principles settled by the Supreme Court. 9. For proper appreciation of the case, it is necessary to extract certain provisions of CPC Sections 22. 23 and 24 and 25 are relevant for the purpose of this case, which reads as under: ""Section 22. Power to transfer suits which may be instituted in more than one Court :-- Where a suit may be instituted in any one of two or more Courts and is instituted in one of such Courts, any defendant, after notice to the other parties, may, at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues arc settled at or before such settlement, apply to have the suit transferred to another Court, and the Court to which such application is made, after considering the objections of the other parties (if any) shall determine in which of the several Courts having jurisdiction the suit shall proceed. Section 23. To what Court application lies :--(1) Where the several Courts having jurisdiction are subordinate to the same Appellate Court, an application under Section 22 shall be made to the Appellate Court. 2. Where such Courts are subordinate to different Appellate Courts but to the same High Court, the application shall be made to the High Court.Mamta Gupta vs Mukund Kumar Gupta on 29 March, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1134791/ 23. Where such Courts are subordinate to different High Courts, the application shall be made to the High Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the Court in which the suit is brought is situate. Section 24: General Power of transfer and withdrawal:--(1) On the application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after hearing such of them as desired to be heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the High Court or the District Court may at any stage- (a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or (b) withdraw any suit, appeal or oilier proceeding pending in any Court subordinate to it; and (i) try or dispose of the same; or (ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or dispose of the same; or (iii) retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the Court from which it was withdrawn. (2) Where any suit or proceeding has been transferred or withdrawn under sub-section (1), the Court which is thereafter to try or dispose of such suit or proceeding may, subject to any special directions in the case of an order of transfer, either retry it or proceed from the point at which it was transferred or withdrawn.

Tipnis, J. 1. This appeal, which was admitted by the 1st Court on 29th July 1997, was taken up for hearing as it was stated on behalf of the appellant that the order is such that it is impossible for him to comply with and will result into grave hardship to the appellant-husband. 2. The order impugned is an ad-interim order passed by the learned Single Judge in a Notice of Motion taken out in a suit filed by the wife under section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act"") for maintenance for herself and her minor daughter. The learned Judge by the impugned order dated 17th July 1997 awarded an ad-interim maintenance of Rs. 7,500/- per month commencing from July 1997. The amount, the learned Judge clarified would include Rs. 1,600/- which the defendant-husband is prepared to pay for the maintenance of the child. 3. Mr. Naphade, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant-husband, read out the impugned order and raised three points. He, firstly, contended that the Court has no jurisdiction to pass an ad-interim order of the nature in a suit filed for maintenance under section 18 of the Act. Mr. Naphade contended that the provisions of section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be pressed into service as, in his submission, those provisions do not confer any additional jurisdiction upon the Court and if there is any specific provision in the statute for the matter involved, then recourse cannot be had to the provisions of section 151. Mr. Naphade took us through the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and pointed out that section 75, etc. relate to incidental proceedings whereas the provisions of sections 94 and 95 of the Code of Civil Procedure are supplemental. In Mr. Naphade's submission, all these procedural provisions ultimately must come in aid of the suit and while passing any such orders, whether incidental or supplemental, the Court must always have advertence to the provisions of section 144 which provide for restitution. Mr. Naphade submitted that if, ultimately, the plaintiff fails in a suit for maintenance, then how will the defendant recover the amount which has been paid for a number of years and, therefore, this factor must be borne in mind by the Court while passing ad-interim or interim orders. Mr. Naphade, thereafter, took us through the provisions of sections 3(b) and 18 of the Act. In section 3(b), maintenance has been defined as under:- ""Maintenance"" includes- (i) in all cases, provisions for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment;Atul Sashikant Mude vs Niranjana Atul Mude on 16 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/598966/ 1(ii) in the case of an unmarried daughter, also the reasonable expenses of and incident to her marriage."" Mr. Naphade, therefore, submitted that so far as maintenance is concerned, this special statute is a complete Code in that behalf and whatever powers or jurisdiction the Court has must be found out from the provisions of the Act. Referring to the provisions of section 18, Mr. Naphade contended that there is no provision for any interim maintenance. In other words, Mr. Naphade contended that on proper construction and interpretation of the various provisions of the Act, it must be held that the Court has no jurisdiction to pass any ad-interim or interim order under section 18 and the only order which could be passed would be at the end of the trial which would be a final order or decree. 4. With reference to his various submissions and especially the first submission regarding jurisdiction Mr. Naphade relied upon several authorises of different courts, including this Court as well as the Apex Court, and submitted that these authorities support his interpretation, viz., that the Court does not have jurisdiction to pass interim orders under section 18 of the Act. 5. The second submission of Mr. Naphade was that even if there is such jurisdiction and power before any interim or ad-interim order is passed, one of the conditions as enumerated in section 18(2) must be shown to be existing. In that behalf, Mr. Naphade referred to certain previous correspondence between the parties as also paras 14, 16 and part of para 23 of the plaint as also some diary which is claimed to be the diary written by the defendant-wife, and contended that there is hardly any reference to the detailed allegations in the aforesaid paragraphs of the plaint, in any previous record such as correspondence or the aforesaid diary. Mr. Naphade contended that therefore, the alleged reasons given in the plaint are totally and patently false and do not inspire any confidence and none of the conditions under section 18(2) are shown to be existing . 6. Coming to the actual amount awarded by the learned Judge, Mr. Naphade contended that the entire material which was relied upon on behalf of the plaintiff-wife in that behalf is reflected in pare 35 of the plaint which material is, in fact, extracted from the petition filed by the husband for custody of the minor child. In that behalf, Mr. Naphade referred to the affidavit filed by the defendant-husband and especially to para 14 thereof in which, according to Mr. Naphade, there is explanation to each and every assertion made in para 35 of the plaint. Mr. Naphade especially relied upon the income-tax returns filed on behalf of the husband for about five years and contended that these returns at least at the time of ad-interim relief should form a reasonable basts for assessing the income and the capacity of the defendant-husband to pay maintenance. Considering the material on record, submitted Mr. Naphade, the order directing Rs. 7,500/- per month is harsh, improper and exorbitant. 7. Mr. Kathawalla, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent-wife, on the other hand, heavily relied upon the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Madhukar v. Bhima, report in A.I.R. 1983 Bombay 480, as also the decision of another learned Single Judge of this Court in Harinder Kaur v. Narendersingh, . He further contended that on proper reading of all other judgments, it is clear that there is no proposition which could be deduced from any other case cited by Mr. Naphade to the effect that under the provisions of section 18 of the Act, there is noAtul Sashikant Mude vs Niranjana Atul Mude on 16 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/598966/ 2jurisdiction in the Court to pass interim or ad-interim orders. Mr. Kathawalla further submitted that, in fact, the decision of Savant, J., in Vinod Kumar Kejriwal v. Usha Vinod Kejriwal, , does not deal with the issue which is before this Court, inasmuch as the same issue never arose in the facts before Savant, J. 8. Mr. Kathawalla next contended that what is argued before this Court in appeal was not at all argued before the trial Court. He contended that what was argued before the trial Court is reflected in the order of the learned Judge which is impugned in the appeal and the only submission which was made was that the ground of cruelty, as is required, was not made out and, secondly, that the Court has no jurisdiction to pass interim order under the provisions of section 18 of the Act. 9. Mr. Kathawalla next submitted that so far as the amount of maintenance is concerned, the learned Judge was more than justified in relying upon para 35 of the plaint which reflects the general financial condition of the husband - Mr. Kathawalla submitted that, in any case, the learned Judge has to take some broad view on the basis of material on record and some workable order has to be passed and at this stage, all issues cannot be gone into nor any issue could be dealt with in detail as if it is a final disposal and final determination thereof. Mr. Kathawala, therefore, submitted that on the basis of facts and circumstances of this case, no fault could be found out with the order of the learned Judge and no interference is required by the Appeal Court. 10. Coming first to the question as to whether the Court has jurisdiction to pass ad-interim orders, it is necessary to refer to the provisions of section 18 of the Act which are as under :-- ""18. Maintenance of wife---(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. (2) A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim to maintenance--- (a) if he is guilty of desertion, that is to say, of abandoning her without reasonable cause and without her consent or against her wish, or of wilfully neglecting her; (b) If he has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with her husband; (c) If he is suffering from a virulent form of leprosy; (d) If he has any other wife living; (e) If he keeps a concubine in the same house in which his wife is living or habitually resides with a concubine elsewhere; (f) If he has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion;Atul Sashikant Mude vs Niranjana Atul Mude on 16 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/598966/ 3",['7']

Sujatha, the detenue, is aged 17 years. She is the daughter of the petitioner. Previously, she was studying in a Higher Secondary School at Tiruvallur and was staying at the house of the petitioner's sister. On 08.06.2011 at about 4.30 p.m. She had gone to a local temple, but she did not return thereafter. The petitioner learnt that the 2nd respondent along with others had kidnapped her. He preferred a complaint in this regard before the 1st respondent on 20.06.2011 on which a case in Crime No.309 of 2011 for offence under Section 366(A) of IPC has been registered. Alleging that the minor detenue was kept illegally by the kidnappers, the petitioner filed the present habeas corpus petition. 2. The 3rd respondent is the father of the 2nd respondent. When this habeas corpus petition came up for hearing before a Division Bench, on 28.07.2011, the Division Bench ordered notice to the respondents. In pursuance of the same, the minor detenue appeared before the Division Bench on 01.08.2011 and filed an affidavit to the effect that she had fallen in love with the 2nd respondent for quite some time and that on knowing the same, her parents started arranging for her marriage with her maternal uncle much against her wish. Therefore, according to her, on 08.06.2011, she left the parental home on her own accord and on 12.07.2011, she married the 2nd respondent. The said marriage has been accepted by the 2nd respondent and his other family members and she is not illegally detained by anybody, she had stated. 3. Based on the above affidavit of the minor detenue, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 contended before the Division Bench that since the detenue was in a position to make intelligent preference to go with the 2nd respondent and since after the said marriage, the 2nd respondent is the legal guardian, the detenue should be set at liberty to go along with the 2nd respondent. 4. But, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the same on several grounds projecting the welfare of the minor detenue. Having considered the rival submissions, the Division Bench presided over by Mr.Justice C.Nagappan directed the minor detenue to be kept in a Government Children's Home. The learned counsel heavily placed reliance on the judgment of another Division Bench of this Court in G.Saravanan v. The Commissioner of Police, Trichy City and others , 2011 - 2 - L.W. (Crl.) 114 wherein the Division Bench has held that a child marriage is neither void nor voidable and the same is valid and so, the husband of the child in marriage is entitled for custody of the child / wife . The Division Bench had doubt about the correctness of the said conclusion. The Division Bench also took note of the judgments in Saraswathi Ammal V. Dhanakoti Ammal, (1924) 47 MLJ 614 [Madras High Court], Seema Devi @ Simran Kaur v. State of Himachal Pradesh, (1928) 2 Crimes 68 (Himachal Pradesh High Court), Neetu Singh v.

State of Madhya Pradesh, [decided on 10.01.2007 by Madhya Pradesh High Court], Avinash v. State of Karnataka, CDJ 2011 KAR HC 373 [Karnataka High Court] and Jitendar Kumar Sharma v. State [decided on 11.10.2010 by Delhi High Court]. In Association for Social Justice and Research Case cited supra , a Division Bench of Delhi High Court observed that the issue relating to custody of a minor girl who has been married has been referred to a Full Bench for decision in LajjaT.Sivakumar vs The Inspector Of Police on 3 October, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/47946406/ 2Devi's case. We are informed that the said reference has not been so far decided by a larger Bench of the Delhi High Court. But, without noticing the same, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Jitendar Kumar Sharma v. State and another reported in 2010 INDLAW DEL 1904, allowed the minor girl to go with the husband. In this background the Division Bench presided over by Mr.Justice C.Nagappan has referred this matter for answering the following questions:- (1) Whether a marriage contracted by a person with a female of less than 18 years could be said to be valid marriage and the custody of the said girl be given to the husband [if he is not in custody]? (2) Whether a minor can be said to have reached the age of discretion and thereby walk away from the lawful guardianship of her parents and refuse to go in their custody? (3) If yes, can she be kept in the protective custody of the State? (4) Whether in view of the provisions of Juvenile Justice [Care and Protection of Children] Act, 2000, a minor girl, who claims to have solemnized her marriage with another person would not be a juvenile in conflict with law and whether in violation of the procedure mandated by the Juvenile Justice [Care and Protection of Children] Act, 2000, the Court dealing with a Writ of Habeas Corpus , has the power to entrust the custody of the minor girl to a person, who contracted the marriage with the minor girl and thereby committed an office punishable under Section 18 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 ? and (5) Whether the principles of Sections 17 and 19(a) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, could be imported to a case arising out of the alleged marriage of a minor girl, admittedly in contravention of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act? Having considered the above, the Hon'ble The Chief Justice has constituted this Full Bench and that is how, the matter is before us. 5. When this matter came up for hearing before this Bench on 19.08.2011, the respondents 2 and 3 in the HCP filed a miscellaneous petition in M.P.No.1 of 2011 seeking an interim order to take the detenue to P.B. College of Engineering, Irrungattukottai, for admission in B.Tch course. Accordingly, this court passed an interim order and permitted her to be taken to PB College of Engineering for admission. The minor detenue was thus admitted in the College. The detenue was also produced before this Court. On enquiries, she informed the court that she was not willing to go with her parents and she was ready to attend the college from the college hostel. Having considered the submissions made and having regard to the interest of the minor detenue, this court directed the minor detenue to be kept in the Government Kellys Home for Children, Chennai and to allow her to go to the college every day, however, with the help of a women police constable. Accordingly, she was attending the college. 6. Again on 07.09.2011 when the matter was listed , the learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 submitted that the detenue found it very difficult to stay in Government Home for Children, Kellys, Chennai as she was facing lot of difficulties. Thus, she wanted the detenue to be allowed to stay in the hostel of the college.

Bandaru Pavani @ Gullipili Pavani         ...Respondent                    J U D G M E N T ALTAMAS KABIR,J. 1. The only question which falls for determination in this Civil Appeal by way of Special Leave is whether a marriage entered into by a Hindu with a Christian is valid under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. The appellant, who is a Roman Catholic Christian allegedly married the respondent, who is a Hindu, on 24.10.1996, in a temple only by exchange of `Thali' and in the absence of any representative from either side. Subsequently, the marriage was registered on 2.11.1996 under Section 8 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, hereinafter referred to as the ""1955 Act"". 3. Soon thereafter, on 13.3.1997, the respondent- wife filed a petition before the Family Court at Vishakapatnam, being O.P. No.84 of 1997, under Section 12(1)(c) of 1955 Act, for a decree of nullity of the marriage entered into between the parties on 24.10.1996 on the grounds mentioned in the said petition. 4. The main ground for declaring the marriage to be a nullity was mainly misrepresentation by the appellant regarding his social status and that he was a Hindu by religion, although it transpired after the marriage that the appellant and his family members all professed the Christian faith. The Family Court dismissed the said petition against which an appeal was preferred by the respondent before the High Court, which allowed the appeal by its judgment and order dated 12.9.2002 upon holdingGullipilli Sowria Raj vs Bandaru Pavani @ Gullipili Pavani on 4 December, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/421764/ 1that the marriage between a Hindu and a Christian under the 1955 Act is void ab initio and that the marriage was, therefore, a nullity. 5. A few months thereafter on 23.1.2003 the respondent married one Dr. Praveen. Thereafter, on 23.4.2003 the appellant filed a Special Leave Petition out of which the present appeal arises. 6. There is no dispute that at the time of the purported marriage between the appellant and the respondent the appellant was a Christian and continues to be so whereas the respondent was a Hindu and continues to be so. There is also no dispute that the marriage was alleged to have been performed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and was also registered under Section 8 thereof. As against the above, a novel argument has been advanced on behalf of the appellant, the substance whereof is that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 does not preclude a Hindu from marrying a person of some other faith. In order to assist the Court in regard to such a submission, the Court had requested Mr. U.U. Lalit, learned Senior Advocate, to assist the Court in the matter. 7. Mr. Lalit firstly took us through the provisions of Section 5 of the 1955 Act which prescribes the conditions for a Hindu marriage. The opening words of Section 5 are as follows: ""A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely :..."" 8. Mr. Lalit submitted that the use of the word `may' in the opening words of Section 5 seems to indicate that the conditions were not mandatory and that as a result, the said conditions would not be binding on the marriage performed between the appellant and the respondent. 9. Mr. Lalit then took us through the provisions of Section 11 of the 1955 Act, which deals with void marriages and indicates as follows : ""11. Void marriages :- Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, against the other party be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v), Section 5."" 10. Mr. Lalit submitted that none of the conditions, as indicated in Section 11, apply to the facts of this case and as such the marriage between the appellant and the respondent could not be said to be a void marriage. According to Mr. Lalit, at best the marriage could be said to be a voidable marriage and the High Court appears to have proceeded on an erroneous footing that the marriage was ab initio void. 11. Adopting the line of submission advanced by Mr. Lalit, Mr. C. Mukund, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the Heading of Section 5 - `Conditions for a Hindu marriage' was a misnomer, having regard to the use of the expression `may' in the opening lines of the Section. Mr. Mukund submitted that the conditions indicated in Section 5 must be held to be optional and that Section 7 of the said Act where also the expression `may' has been used in Sub-section (1) must beGullipilli Sowria Raj vs Bandaru Pavani @ Gullipili Pavani on 4 December, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/421764/ 2understood to refer to a marriage and not the parties to the marriage. Mr. Mukund submitted that Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, would, therefore, have an overriding effect over the provisions of Section 5 which, according to him, were optional. Mr. Mukund reiterated that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, does not contemplate a valid marriage only between two Hindus, and urged that the High Court had erred in allowing the respondent's application under Section 12(1)(c) of the above Act on such misconception of the provisions thereof. 12. Mr. Y. Rajagopala Rao, learned advocate appearing for the respondent wife, submitted that it will first have to be decided whether the marriage performed between the parties was a valid Hindu marriage or not. According to Mr. Rao, the other questions would arise only thereafter. In this regard, Mr. Rao submitted that the Preamble to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in unambiguous terms makes it clear that the Act was promulgated to amend and codify law relating to marriage amongst Hindus. He urged that the language of the Preamble leaves no room for doubt that the Act and its provisions would apply to Hindus only, as defined in Section 2, Sub-section (1)(c) whereof specifically excludes a person professing the Christian faith from the its ambit. Mr. Rao urged that each religious community in India had their own form of marriages which excluded members of other religious communities, though the Indian Marriage Act did recognize a marriage between a Christian and non-Christian to be valid, though under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. 13. Mr. Rao also referred to Section 2 of the above Act which reads as follows: 2.-Application of Act- (1) This Act applies,- (a) to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of of its forms or developments, including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj; (b) to any person who is a Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion, and (c) to any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed. Explanation.- The following persons are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion, as the case may be,- (a) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion; (b) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist Jaina or Sikh by religion and who is brought up as a member of tribe, community, group or family to which such parents belongs or belonged; andGullipilli Sowria Raj vs Bandaru Pavani @ Gullipili Pavani on 4 December, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/421764/ 3","['12', '5', '8', '2', '11', '7']"

Shah, J. 1. Whether the wife can be denied maintenance pendente lite under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 only on the ground that her marriage with her husband is the second marriage during the subsistence of the first marriage and the same is void under section 11 read with section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act and whether such a wife is also disentitled from claiming interim maintenance in proceedings under section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 are the questions which fell for consideration in this review petition. 2. Very few facts are necessary for appreciation of the controversy arising in this petition. Both the principal parties namely the petitioner and the respondent No. 1 are Hindus governed by Hindu law. The case of the respondent No. 1 is that she was married to the petitioner according to the Hindu vedic rites on 29th June, 1986 in a temple at Ulhasnagar and that the respondent No. 2 is their daughter born from the marriage. The respondent No. 1 has filed matrimonial petition bearing No. A-2082 of 1996 in the Family Court, Bombay, under section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act for declaration that the. marriage between her and the petitioner is void on the ground that the petitioner was already married and his first wife was living at the time of the second marriage and hence the second marriage was a nullity. She has also filed maintenance Petition No. C-215 of 1996 under section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, claiming maintenance for herself and the minor daughter. The respondent No. 1 took out Interim Application No. 711 of 1997 claiming interim maintenance of Rs. 25,000.00 and Rs. 10,000.00 respectively for herself and her daughter. The application was resisted by the petitioner mainly on the ground that even according to the respondent No. 1 marriage is a nullity and therefore she is not entitled to claim interim maintenance. The petitioner also denied the factum of marriage though he accepted the paternity of the daughter. By an order dated 5th February, 1998 the Family Court awarded interim maintenance of Rs. 5000.00 and Rs. 2500.00 per month to the respondent Nos. and 2 respectively. The Family Court relying upon the decision of this Court in Govindrao v. Sou. Anandibai, , held that even though the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent No. 1 was null and void in view of the provisions of section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as the condition imposed by Clause (i) of section 5 thereof was not fulfilled, she is not disentitled from claiming interim maintenance. This order was challenged by the petitioner by filing Writ Petition No. 1946 of 1998 which came to be dismissed summarily on 15th June, 1998. Thereupon the petitioner has taken out this petition seeking review of the order of dismissal. It is required to be stated that the challenge in the review petition is restricted to the award of interim maintenance to the respondent No. 1 alone and the order awarding interim maintenance to the daughter is not challenged. 3. Mr. Thorat, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner strenuously contended that the words ""wife"" and ""husband"" used in section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, must be construed in their strictMr. Krishnakant Mulashankar Vyas vs Mrs. Reena Krishna Vyas & Another on 25 August, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/866480/ 1grammatical sense and, so construed would mean a lawfully wedded Hindu wife and a lawfully wedded Hindu husband. It was submitted by him that in the present case the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent No. 1 was null and void ab initio. It never created the relationship of husband and wife between the petitioner and the respondent No. 1. They were never husband and wife in the strict legal sense and hence the provisions of section 24 cannot apply to them at all. It was urged by Mr. Thorat that even under section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, the word wife is required to be given restrictive meaning which imply the relation that results from a recognised legal mode of marriage and therefore a second wife whose marriage is void is not entitled to claim maintenance under section 18 of the said Act. Mr. Thorat urged that the decision of this Court in Govindrao v. Sou. Anandibai (supra) is no longer good law in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Yamunabai v. Anantrao, . In any event according to Mr. Thorat the issue is required to be re-considered in the light of the Apex Court's decision in Yamunabei v. Anantrao. Mr. Thorat therefore contended that the order of interim maintenance passed by the Family Court in favour of the respondent No. 1 wife is not sustainable in law. 4. As the arguments in this petition turn, to a large extent, on some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, which came into force on 18th May, 1955, it may not be out of place to take notice of the same at this stage. Section 5 of the Act lays down the conditions of a valid Hindu marriage and one of the conditions is that it should be a marriage between two Hindus where neither party has a spouse living at the time of marriage. Under section 9 of the Act, parties to the marriage may obtain decree for restitution of conjugal rights from the Court. Section 11 of the Act permits a party to approach the Court for a decree of nullity if the marriage contravenes any of the conditions specified in section 5 including Clause 9 (i) thereof where one of the parties had a spouse living at the time of marriage. Section 13 of the Act contains grounds on the basis of which divorce can be obtained. Under section 16 of the Act children of void and voidable marriage are deemed to be legitimate. Section 17 of the Act makes a bigamous marriage punishable in accordance with section 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code, Under section 23(2) of the Act, the matrimonial Court at the first instance is required in every case to make an endeavour to bring about reconciliation between the parties. 5. Under section 23-A of the Act, in a proceeding instituted by one spouse the other spouse as respondent can claim any of the reliefs available to him under the Act. Section 23-A of the Act may be quoted: ""23-A. Relief for respondent in divorce and other proceedings:--In any proceeding for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights, the respondent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion, but also make a counter-claim for any relief under this Act on that ground; and if the petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion is proved, the Court may give to the respondent any relief under this Act to which he or she would have been entitled if he or she had presented any petition seeking such relief on that ground."" 6. Under section 24 of the Act, the Court can fix interim maintenance for payment to the one spouse by other where one of them is unable to maintain him or her and the other has means to do so.

Maintenance pendente lite' and expenses of the proceedings:--Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable."" 7. The provision contained in section 25 of the Act empowering the Court to grant permanent alimony to either of the parties at the time of passing of the decree is also relevant and is also quoted: ""25. Permanent alimony and maintenance.---(1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property of the applicant the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent."" 8. Under section 26 of the Act, the Court has power to pass suitable orders for custody, maintenance and education of children. Under section 27 of the Act, the Court has power to pass orders in respect of the property presented at the time of marriage. 9. From the entire scheme of the Act as stated above, it is seen that it is a piece of social welfare legislation regulating the marital relations of Hindus consistently with their customary law, i.e., Hindu law. The object behind section 24 of the Act providing for maintenance pendente lite to a party in matrimonial proceedings is obviously to provide financial assistance to the indigent spouse to maintain herself or himself during the pendency of the proceedings and also to have sufficient funds to carry on the litigation so that the spouse does not unduly suffer in the conduct of the case for want of funds. When considering such a piece of legislation, it would not be right to adopt a narrow pedantic approach. On the other hand if the Court desires to gather the legislative intention from the provisions of such an Act, it must adopt a liberal and progressive approach keeping in mind that it was the liberal and progressive approach of the legislature which led to the enactment being passed. It may be seen from the abovementioned provisions of the Act that even in a case of bigamous marriage one of the parties can seek a decree of nullity of marriage by way of petitioner or respondent which is permissible under section 23-A of the Act. It may also be seen that in pending proceedings even at the instance of the second wife in a void bigamous marriage, the Court is empowered to make an attempt for re-conciliation, to pass necessary orders with regard to the custody of children and disposal of the property exchanged at the time of marriage. The Court has also power in such proceedings to make an order of permanent alimony or maintenance underMr. Krishnakant Mulashankar Vyas vs Mrs. Reena Krishna Vyas & Another on 25 August, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/866480/ 3","['17', '23-A', '13', '24', '5', '11']"

Since both these matters raise a common point of law, both of them have been placed before the Full Bench for deciding the following question: ""Whether a Hindu Marriage governed by the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 where the parties to the marriage or either of them are below their respective ages as set out in Clause (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is void ab initio and is no marriage in the eye of law."" In Crl. R.C. of 1975, the facts of that the petitioner No. 1 was convicted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Rajam for an offence punishable under Section 494 I.P. C. And petitioner No. 2 was convicted for an offence punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109, I.P.C. Both of them filed appeals and the appellate Court confirmed the convictions of both the petitioners, but modified their sentences to that of payment of Rs. 200/- and in default of payment of fine, each of the petitioners was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month. Against their convictions and sentences, the petitioners came by way of revision to this High Court. 2. When the revision application came up before one of us (Muktadar, J.) on behalf of the petitioners, reliance was placed on the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in P.A. Saramma v. G. Ganapatulu (). In that case, the Division bench has held that a marriage, which is in contravention of Clause (iii) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act is void ab initio and is no marriage in the eye of law. Since it was felt that the view taken by the Division Bench was not in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the matter was referred to a larger Bench. Thereafter, the matter came up before Chinappa Reddy and Punnayya, JJ. And, by their order dated March 22, 1976, they referred the matter to a Full Bench and thereafter the matter has come before us. 3. In Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 809 of 1976, the Ist Petitioner is the husband and others are co-accused with him in a complaint filed by the Ist respondent-wife in the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate , Siddipet, Medak District. The Ist respondent in this criminal miscellaneous Petition filed a criminal complaint, C.C. No. 323 of 1976, in the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Siddipet, against her husband (Ist petitioner) and ten others alleging that her husband had committed an offence punishable under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code and that the other accused had committed an offence punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109 I.P.C. According to the petitioner in this petition at the time of the marriage i.e. in the year 1959 he was 13 years of age and the Ist Respondent was 9 years of age. The husband contends that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in P.A. Saramma v. G. Ganapatulu , the marriage between him and the Ist respondent was void ab initio and no marriage in the eye of law and hence the action of the Ist petitioner in marrying a girl did not amount to an offence punishable underPinninti Venkataramana And Anr. vs State on 9 August, 1976 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131121/ 1Section 494. Under these circumstances in this criminal miscellaneous petition, the petitioners have prayed that the prosecution in C.C. No. 323 of 1976 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Siddipet, be quashed. Since the question involved in this criminal miscellaneous petition is the same as the one raised in Criminal Revision Application No. 190/75, which stood referred to a Full Bench, this Criminal miscellaneous petition was also directed to be posted along with the criminal revision application. It is under these circumstances that both these matters have been heard together by this Full Bench. 4. In order to appreciate the rival contentions in these cases, it is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The preamble of the Act shows that it is an Act to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus. Section 4 provides: 'Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act- (a) any test, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for which provision is made in this Act; (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act."" It is well settled law that the old Hindu Law, as it prevailed prior to the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act is to continue in force except to the extent to which that law was altered by the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. It is in the light of this well settled principle that arises for our consideration. 5. Section 5 lays down the conditions for a Hindu marriage and it is in these terms: ""A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled namely; (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) neither party is an idiot or a lunatic at the time of the marriage; (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of eighteen years and the bride the age of fifteen years at the time of the marriage; (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom of usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) The parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the twoPinninti Venkataramana And Anr. vs State on 9 August, 1976 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131121/ 2(vi) where the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of her guardian in marriage, if any, has been obtained for the marriage."" Section 11 lays down as to when marriages governed by the Act are to be considered void marriages. It is in these terms: ""Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5"". It is thus clear that , by virtue of Section 11, any marriage which is solemnized in contravention of any of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 is null and void and if a Court of competent jurisdiction is called upon to make a pronouncement , the Court may, on an application presented by either party to the marriage, declare such a marriage to be null and void. Thus, out of the six clauses of Section 5, it is only in connection with clauses (i), (iv) and (v)of Section 5 that the Legislature has declared that the contravention of any one of the conditions mentioned in those three clauses will render the marriage null and void. 6. Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with voidable marriages. Sub-section (1) provides that any marriage whether solemnized before or after the commencement of the Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any one of the grounds specified in clauses (a) to (d). Clause (b) of sub-section (1) provides that, if the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (i) of Section 5, the marriage shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity. Clause (c) provides that, if the consent of the petitioner or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner is required under Section 5, the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or fraud, the marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity. Clause (ii) of Section 5 requires that neither party is an idiot or a lunatic at the time of the marriage and clause (vi) provides that, where the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of her guardian in marriage, if any, has to be obtained. 7. Now the following points of distinction between Sections 11 and 12 have to be noted: (1) Section 11 applies only to marriages solemnized after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act; whereas Section 12 (1) applies to any marriage whether solemnized before or after the commencement of the Act and (2) whereas violation of the provisions of Clauses (i) (iv) and (v) of Section 5 renders the marriage null and void, violation of the different clauses of Section 5 mentioned in Section 12 (1) renders the marriage voidable and if the requirements of one or the other clauses of Section 12 are satisfied, the marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity of a Court having competent jurisdiction. Now, it is worth noting that violation of clause (ii) of Section 5 renders the marriage viodable and not null and void. Though, under clause (vi) of Section 5, in case the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of her guardian is obtained it is not the absence of the consent of the guardian that renders the marriage voidable, but it is only when the consent of the guardian in marriage, which is required under Section 5, is vitiated by force or fraud that the marriage is liable to be annulled by a decree of nullity on the ground that it is voidable. Even though none of the clauses of S.5 refers to the requirement of consent of the petitioner, it is only if thePinninti Venkataramana And Anr. vs State on 9 August, 1976 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131121/ 3","['4', '10','12', '5', '11']"

Rohini, J. 1. These two appeals filed by the wife arise out of a common order of the Family Court at Hyderabad dated 27-8-1999 made in OP Nos. 775 of 1996 and 567 of 1995. Whereas OP No. 567 of 1995 has been filed by the husband against the wife seeking dissolution of marriage between the parties under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the other OP No. 775 of 1996 has been filed by the wife under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking restitution of conjugal rights. Both the OPs were tried together and on the basis of common evidence adduced, the family Court by a common order allowed OP No. 567 of 1995 granting decree of divorce and dismissed OP No. 775 of 1996 filed by wife for restitution of conjugal rights. Aggrieved by the said order the wife filed the present appeals viz., CMA Nos. 108 of 2000 and 3186 of 1999 against the common order in OP No. 775 of 1996 and OP No. 567 of 1995 respectively. Since both these appeals arose out of a common order, they are heard and decided together. 2. For the purpose of convenience, the parties in these appeals are hereinafter referred to as the wife and husband, 3. It is admitted by both the parties that they were married on 8-12-1993 at Tirumala and the marriage was consummated on 10-12-1993. It is also admitted that even by the date of the marriage the wife is an employee of Railways and working as Enquiry-cum-Reservation Clerk at Secunderabad Railway Reservation Complex. It is also not in dispute that the father of the wife is also a Retired Railway Officer and the parents of the wife are residing at Metuguda, Secunderabad, very near to the work place of the wife. The house of the husband is situated at Saleemnagar Colony, Malakpet, Hyderabad and both the parties admitted that soon after the marriage, the wife joined the husband at his house where he is staying along with his parents and younger brother. 4. The husband filed OP No. 567 of 1995 on 19-6-1995 in the Family Court at Hyderabad under Section 13 (1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking dissolution of the marriage between the parties on the ground of cruelty. The averments made by the husband in the said petition in brief are as follows: 5. After the marriage it has come to the notice of the husband that the wife likes to stay with her mother who was residing at Metuguda, Secunderabad and that in the 18 months of the married life, she might have hardly stayed in his house for 60 days, that too intermittently. It was also alleged that the wife was very arrogant and had no respect for elders and had no civilized habits. Her duties are in shifts from 8-00 a.m., to 2-00 p.m., and 2-00 p.m., to 8-00 p.m. She gets up very late whenever her duties are in the afternoon. She always keeps herself aloof and did not mingle with the family members of the husband. She does not know cooking and she used to expect her mother-in-law or other members of the family to cook for her and serve food at her room. She usedK. Radha Raju vs K. Seetharama Raju on 7 September, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1053182/ 1to got to her mother's house without informing anybody including the husband and used to return whenever she liked. It was also alleged that the wife did not join the thread marriage ceremony and the marriage of the younger brother of the husband and she also failed to attend any important and religious functions in the house of the husband. It was further alleged that the wife got her pregnancy aborted without the consent or knowledge of the husband sometime in March, 1984 and during the second pregnancy though the Doctors advised that she needs absolute bed rest to save pregnancy, she refused to do so resulting in premature delivery by Cesarean operation in October, 1984 and the female child born to her died just after an hour. It had also been alleged by the husband that the wife levelled false and unfounded allegations against him attributing illicit intimacy with the newly wedded wife of his younger brother and she abused and insulted the husband in the presence of his parents and elders and left the matrimonial home on 3-6-1995. Thus the husband alleged that the conduct of the wife had been very arrogant and her behaviour resulted in mental torture, lack of peace and harmony and particularly the allegation of illicit intimacy with the wife of his younger brother had caused intolerable mental cruelty to him as well as to his family members and that he apprehends that his wife would go to any extent and it would be most unsafe and would further endanger the safety, mental harmony of the husband as well as the members of his family if they were to live together. Therefore, the husband sought for dissolution of the marriage on the ground of cruelty. 6. The wife filed a counter on 1-4-1996 denying all the allegations made by the husband. So far as the allegation that she likes to stay with her mother at Metuguda, Secunderabad, she stated that inspite of the fact that her work place is situated for away from the house of husband and in spite of hostile atmosphere she had to face in the house of the husband, she stayed in the matrimonial house till she was practically driven out of the house by the husband and his parents. She further stated that she could not attend that thread ceremony and the marriage of the younger brother of her husband on account of her ill health and she specifically denied the allegation that she got her first pregnancy aborted without the knowledge and consent of the husband. She stated that she suffered a spontaneous abortion and though the husband was present he did not provide any medical aid to her. As far as the second pregnancy is concerned, she stated that it was very cruel on the part of the husband to allege that she deliberately did not follow the medical advice resulting in premature delivery and death of the child. She specifically denied the allegation of husband that she attributed illicit intimacy to the husband with the wife of his younger brother. On the other hand, she stated that she suffered mental cruelty and humiliation at the hands of the husband and his parents and sister. She further stated that she is anxious to join her husband and she never contemplated initiating any civil or criminal litigation against her husband and his parents. She further stated that she tried her best for reconciliation and to resume the conjugal life with the husband and pleaded that the allegation of cruelty on her part in without any basis and was invented only for purpose of the present petition at the instance of parents and sister of the husband. She also alleged that the father of the husband demanded Rs. 5-00 lakhs in the negotiations for reconciliation and since her parents did not pay Rs. 5-00 lakhs as per their demand, the parents and sister of the husband prevailed upon her husband and got filed by the petition for dissolution marriage with all false allegations.K. Radha Raju vs K. Seetharama Raju on 7 September, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1053182/ 27. It may be noted that simultaneously on 1-4-1996 the wife also filed OP No. 775 of 1996 under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking restitution of conjugal rights. She pleaded several details in the said petition and some of the important averments in her petition are as follows: Their marriage was an arranged marriage and as per caste custom, her parents gave Rs. 50,000/- in cash to the sister of her husband towards the 'Adapaduchkatnam'. The parents of the wife made clear at the time of the marriage that she would become owner of the properties worth Rs. 10-00 lakhs acquired by her through her own savings, gifts and inheritance. The parents of the husband also informed that the husband is having a share worth Rs. 30-00 lakhs in the family properties and they were under no further obligation to give anything to their marriage daughter. It was mutually agreed that the wife should be permitted to continue in service and keep her monthly salary for herself. It is specifically averred that the married sister of her husband used to visit their house every week end and she used to make taunting remarks that she could have secured a better alliance for her brother. Even within a week after the marriage, the husband and his parents suggested that the wife should purchase a flat belonging to the husband's sister in the same building as she was finding it difficult to dispose off the same. It is further alleged that the father of the husband demanded through her maternal uncle that her mother shall give Rs. 1-00 lakh to meet his family needs. It is also alleged that the mother of the husband was not allowing her son to lead a happy married life with the wife. She also narrated in detail about her first pregnancy, which was aborted in April, 1994, to show that it was only accidental, but not at her instance as alleged by the husband. She also stated that when she had to undergo Caesarean operation on 20-10-1994 either her husband or in-laws did not turn up and instead of showing any sympathy for the death of the newborn child, the father-in-law exhibited anger. She had to stay at her parents' house only as per the directions of her father-in-laws soon after the Caesarean operation for about six months. Thereafter, the wife and her parents took initiative and after several persuasions, she was allowed to return to the house of the husband on 17-5-1995. Her father took her to the house of the husband, but since her mother-in-law was away from the house, the husband and his father asked her to come back only after the return of her mother-in-law and accordingly on 31-5-1995, she along with her father went to the house of the husband. However, she was not looked after properly either by the husband or by her-in-laws. On 2-6-1995 she attended the duty though she was not quite well and returned home around 5-30 p.m. As she was not well, she was taking rest, but the husband asked her to prepare food and when she expressed her inability on account of ill-health her grew wild and while condemning the wife profusely praised his younger sister-in-law. Then the wife remarked that he was unable to recognise his wife's ability, but was very quick to notice and exaggerate his younger brother wife's capabilities. On this remark, the husband got irritated and became wild and called his father and told him that her words suggest imputations of illicit relationship between him and his sister-in-law. It is alleged that all the family members behaved with her indecently and she was asked to get out of the house. With a view to save the marriage the petitioner kept quite. On 4-6-1995 when she went to Office, her father met her in her Office and told her that her father-in-law fixed a meeting in the same evening and wanted him to attend the said meeting along with his daughter. It is alleged that at the meeting all the family members of her husband accused her alleging that she does not know cooking and asked her father to send her back only after teaching his daughter how to cook. Placed in a helpless situation and having realized that the parents-in-law are not inclined to permit his daughter to lead normal conjugal rights, the father of the wife took her to his house.K.

We have heard the learned counsel for the wife -- appellant as well as the learned counsel representing the husband -- respondent and have carefully perused the record. 3.

The Suit giving rise to this appeal had been filed on 9-1-1997 claiming a decree of divorce and annulment of the marriage praying for ""Setting the petitioner (husband) at liberty from the marital ties"". The husband had come up with the case that he had been married to the defendant-wife on 20-11-1975 out of which wed-lock three sons were born. It was claimed that the wife was a woman of hard temperament and rude behaviour. After the marriage, she had been picking up quarrels not only with the husband but also with his parents and creating scenes and insisting upon for separate residence. The wife and her father, who was running a business at Bombay, had been playing tricks with the husband and dodging him from the very inception. The wife was a cunning woman and was hungry for wealth and acting in conspiracy with her parents, had trapped the petitioner/plaintiff in such a way that whatever assets were made by the petitioner were ostensibly taken in her name. 5. It was further alleged that in May, 1994 while the husband along with the wife and children had visited the place of his fa ther-in-law in connection with his Golden Wedding Anniversary, the petitioner had detected that the wife was indulging in vul garity amounting to un-chastity with a doc tor namely Vishwas Raut. Her conduct was highly unbecoming of a married woman. Husband had started living separately from the wife from May, 1994. The wife had also attempted to poison him in February, 1995. The wife had started misbehaving with the husband and creating scenes making the life of the husband very miserable.

It was also claimed that in the absence of the husband, the wife had even forcibly broken the locks of his apartment at Chitrakoot and the cupboard kept there and had removed valuable unit certificates, shares certificates, Bank and PPF Passbooks, jewellery and other important papers. The wife with a view to make the petitioner financially a wreck had clandestinely with drew an amount of Rs. 9.50 Lacs from the account of Nikhil Rubbers (P) Ltd. maintained in standard chartered bank on 19-6-1996 and transferred the same to her personal account & withdrew the same. She had also lodged a false First Information Report under Section 420/467/468/471, IPC against the petitioner to get him arrested. Criminal case bearing No. 256 of 1996 had ben registered and the petitioner has to face the trial. The wife had also gone to another factory of the husband along with the police and created a situation where the husband had been beaten up. She had employed Goonda elements not only to kill the husband but also to take over the factory. The wife got made publication in the newspapers openly undermining his status in the Society alleging that he was an employee and he had abandoned his job in May, 1996. She had managed to get the petitioner beaten up by his son Nitin Kohli and maternal uncle Subhash Bhasin. The petitioner was manhandled, abused, and scolded by the Thana Incharge. 7. It was further claimed that the wife herself was living in unchastity and misbehaving with the petitioner and using defamatory language. The husband had filed a Suit for judicial separation being O.S. No. 666 of 1995 but that Suit was not pursued as separation according to him was not the panacea for the redress sought for. The husband claimed that it was a case of exceptional hardship. His life had been ruined and the wife only loved money and her paramour, A stage had been reached where it was no longer possible for him to call the opposite party as his wife. The husband asserted that the marriage had been irretrievably broken. 8. The aforesaid Suit was contested by the wife by filing a detailed written statement denying the allegations levelled against her. A specific plea had been taken relating to non-joinder of necessary party as the husband had not impleaded as party -- respondent the alleged adulterer. She had asserted that the petitioner -- husband had throughout misbehaved with her with faithlessness and rudeness. He had been thrown out from his parental house by his father and thereafter had established a Rubber unit, which was fully financed by the parents of the wife. 9. So far as the premises No. 7/36-A, Tilak Nagar, Kanpur was concerned, it was claimed that it had been purchased out of her own capital and not a single Naya Paisa had been contributed by the petitioner towards the purchase of the said premises. A First Information Report about the criminal activities of the husband had been lodged when without any authority and consent of the wife, he had withdrawn a large amount for which there could be no justification. 10. It was asserted that the wife had not lodged any false report against the husband and had not made any attempt to get him arrested. The husband-plaintiff had, however, given a merciless beating to his own son and had tried to kill him as the son had strongly protested against the immoral relation of his father with a woman named Smt. Shiva Nagi of Bombay. The son had protested against the petitioner's shameful misbehaviour with his mother and abusing and beating her.Smt.

Juhu Vile, Parle Scheme, Mumbal as his mistress and both of them were residing together at premise No. 13/384, Civil Lines, Kanpur as husband and wife. The wife had claimed that in order to legalize his immoral relation with the said woman, the petitioner-husband had filed the suit giving rise to this appeal claiming a decree of divorce on utterly false and fabricated case and scandalous allegations. Criminal case had been registered against the petitioner relating to his criminal activities. The wife claimed that she had never treated the petitioner with cruelty although the husband had opted to desert her and live with another woman separately. The relations between the petitioner-husband and Smt. Shiva Nagi were immoral as they were living virtually as husband and wife. The wife also complained that the major portion of her jewellery and cash had been forcibly grabbed by the petitioner-husband. 12. She denied having use of any criminal or physical force or causing any hurt to the husband. She further claimed that the husband was running his life in an immoral company of his concubine viz. Smt. Shiva Nagi. 13. It was also claimed that since the Original Suit No. 666 of 1995 filed for judicial separation by the husband had been withdrawn, the present suit on the same cause of action could not be maintained. It was further claimed that the husband had deserted his legally wedded wife and opted to live with a married woman and in such a situation he could not be permitted to take undue advantage of his own wrongs. The wife asserted that she sincerely desired to live with the petitioner-husband and lead a life of conjugal happiness. 14. The husband-plaintiff filed a replication in which he reiterated his case as stated in the plaint. 15. The trial Court had framed an issue on the question relating to the effect of the non-impleadment of Dr. Vishvas Raut -- the alleged adulterer which was issue No. 5. It was decided separately vide the judgment and order dated 2-11-1999. The trial Court had come to the conclusion that as the plaintiff himself had asserted that the Suit had been filed on the ground of cruelty and even if adultery part was ignored, the Suit could still be held to be maintainable on the ground of cruelty, and the issue No. 5 had to be answered in favour of the plaintiff. However, the trial Court made it clear that since the plaintiff had made a statement that he is confining his claim on the ground of cruelty and had not impleaded the alleged adulterer, he will not be entitled to lead any evidence on the question relating to the adultery nor such a ground will be available for consideration in support of the case of cruelty. It was clearly indicated that the plaintiff will neither be granted permission to lead evidence on the aspect relating to the alleged adultery nor any evidence led in support of such a plea will be taken into consideration. The aforesaid findings of the Trial Court have not been assailed and have attained finality. 16. It may be noticed at this stage that during the pendency of the Suit the wife had moved an application (paper No. 162-C-2) asserting that the husband was living in adultery with Smt. Shiva Nagi wife of Sardar Amarjeet Singh Nagi who had accompanied him and had gone to London. It was prayed that the passport of the plaintiff be summoned and the husband be directed to produce his passport and a Photostat copy of that passport may be placed on the record.

Gokhale, J. 1. These two appeals filed by a wife seek to challenge the common judgment and order dated 12th February 2004 passed by Family Court No. III at Pune in Petition No. A-827 of 2000 and Petition No. C-55 of 2002. Petition No. A-827 of 2000 as filed by the respondent husband seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956. Petition No. C-55 of 2002 was filed by the appellant wife seeking permanent maintenance under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The impugned common judgment allowed the petition filed by the respondent husband seeking divorce and dismissed the petition filed by the appellant wife for maintenance. It is, therefore, that these two appeals are filed by the appellant wife arising out of the two proceedings. 2. The short facts leading to these appeals are as follows: • The appellant and the respondent were married as per the Hindu Vedic Rites on 19th December 1997. Soon thereafter, differences developed between the two and they are not living together from 25th August 1999, thought it is the case of the appellant that she was driven out of the matrimonial home. There is no child from this marriage. The appellant wife has her own employment and it has come in evidence that her monthly salary was Rs. 6,000/-, out of which take-home amount was Rs. 5,300/-. The respondent husband was working as a teacher with a salary of Rs. 3,000/- as per the salary slip, the take-home amount being Rs. 2,940/-. It is the claim of the appellant wife that the respondent was also running the business of advertising and had additional income therefrom. 3. The respondent husband raised various grounds to substantiate his case for cruelty. As enumerated by the learned Family Court Judge, there were in all six instances of cruelty, they being as follows:- (i) Refusal to do domestic work. (ii) Insulting and abusing. (iii) Insisting on having a separate residence. (iv) To visit the matrimonial home and not to return on a number of days every week. (v) Threatening and terrorising the husband and his parents. (vi) Not disclosing that she had some gaenacological problem prior to marriage and concealing her miscarriage which took place sometime in December 1998.Mrs. Manisha Sandeep Gade vs Sandeep Vinayak Gade on 1 October, 2004 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/425079/ 1The appellant wife denied these allegations, but over and above the denials, she made certain allegations of her own in para 5(K) and (L) of the written statement. In para 5(K), she mainly made three allegations; (i) the respondent behaved with her perversely and harassed her sexually; (ii) he would indulge in obscene talks with his girl friends on phone and in person and would behave immodestly with the girl friends to torture the appellant, (iii) he had illicit relationship with one Leena, wife of Vivek, and in fact he wanted to marry her. In para 5(L), she made allegations against her father in law that his behaviour with her was improper and in that she alleged that (i) he would touch her unnecessarily and (ii) he would barge into the kitchen if she was changing her clothes. 4. The respondent examined himself and then led the evidence of a few supporting witnesses, including his mother. The appellant examined herself and a few supporting witnesses. The examination-in-chief was by way of filing affidavits on the basis of which the cross-examination was conducted. After recording this evidence, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed to establish the six specific instances of cruelty. He, however, took the view that the allegations made by the appellant in her written statement were baseless and amounted to cruelty. The learned Judge noted that with respect to the allegations about relationship between the respondent and Leena, except the bare words in the affidavit of appellant, there is no other evidence on record. He commented that it was her duty to examine Vivek. Similarly with respect to the allegations against the father of the respondent, the learned Judge noted that the allegations were vague and she should have given some details about the same. He, therefore, allowed the petition filed by the respondent husband on the ground of cruelty and granted the decree of divorce. Sine he was granting the decree of divorce, he examined the question as to whether the appellant wife was entitled to permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Having however noted that the income of the appellant wife was more, he held that she was not entitled to permanent alimony. 5. As far as the other petition under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 is concerned, since the learned Judge was dissolving the marriage between the two, he took the view that the appellant wife could not claim relief under Section 18 of the said Act since Sub-section (1) of Section 18 of that Act gives a right to a Hindu wife to maintenance, which right is available during the subsistence of the marriage. The said section also provides for the right of residence to a wife. However, that right would be available if the husband is guilty of cruelty. That apart, on the facts of the case, the learned Judge was of the view that the respondent husband did not have such capacity to provide any separate residence. He, therefore, dismissed the petition for maintenance filed by the appellant wife under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. 6. It is material to note that whereas the wife was filed FCA No. 49 of 2004 to challenge the order of divorce which is granted in view of her baseless allegations, the respondent husband has not filed any cross objection to the extent the learned Family Court held that the six instances of cruelty claimed by him were not established. Therefore, the question as to whether those items specifically pleaded by the respondent husband constituted cruelty or not no longer survives. The respondent husband not having challenged the finding on those six items, it will have to be held that he has accepted that he has failed to establish the allegations of cruelty on those grounds. We may as well add that the counsel for the respondent also did not press any of those instances in argument.Mrs. Manisha Sandeep Gade vs Sandeep Vinayak Gade on 1 October, 2004 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/425079/ 27. When these appeals came up for admission, on a query from the court, the counsel for the respondent informed the court that he had not remarried. That was in spite of the impugned order having been passed on 12th February 2004. A statement was made by his counsel on 8th July 2004 that he will not proceed to take any further steps to marry until further orders are passed in these appeals. Inasmuch as there was no possibility of the parties living together any more, an attempt to dissolve the marriage by consent was made, but that did not succeed. On 15th July 2004. the matter was adjourned to 22nd July 2004 making it clear that in the event the parties do not arrive at any understanding, both the matters will be heard finally at the admission stage itself. The paper-book was filed by the parties which consisted of the copies of the entire record of the Trial Court. They were accordingly heard fully at the admission stage since the counsel for both the parties desired that the parties should know their fate at the earliest, particularly since both the appellant and the respondent are young. 8. As stated above, the question which arises for consideration is as to whether the learned Judge of the Family Court was right in granting divorce merely on the basis of the allegations made by the appellant wife in her written statement. In this connection, the further submission of the counsel for the appellant is that the least that was expected of the respondent was to amend his petition and the respondent ought to have raised the plea that he has suffered cruelty in view of the allegations made in the written statement. Thereafter specific evidence on that behalf should have been led before any such conclusion was arrived at. In the absence of any such plea being raised by amending the petition, the respondent should not have been allowed to argue the plea of cruelty merely on the basis of the allegations made in the written statement. Alternatively, it is submitted that in any case at the highest it could be said that the appellant has failed to prove her allegations, but it does not mean that she has made false and baseless allegations and therefore the decree of divorce was not called for. As against that, the submission of the respondent is that the allegations are so wanton that they have to be only noticed to examine whether they will constitute cruelty or not. If that is so, the decree of divorce ought to follow inasmuch as Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956 speaks of ""treating the other party with cruelty"". The phrase is wide enough and would cover a cruel treatment even subsequent to the filing of the petition by making baseless allegations in the written statement. That being so, there is no need to amend the petition and on the strength of such allegations themselves,the decree of divorce ought to follow. 9. Before we look into the submissions and the supporting authorities, it will be desirable to look into the specific averments in this behalf and the evidence led thereon. Now as far as para 5(K) and (L) of the written statement are concerned, para 5(K) contained three allegations; (i) the respondent behaved with the appellant perversely and harassed her sexually; (ii) he would indulge in obscene talks with girl friends and behaved immodestly with them to torture the appellant, and (iii) he had illicit relationship with one Leena, wife of Vivek. Inasmuch the entire case of both the parties depends on these pleadings, it would be desirable to reproduce these two paragraphs in their entirety. Para 5(K) and (L) read as follows:- ""(K) The Petitioner then started behaving perversely. He would not only harass the Respondent sexually but also would indulge to obscene talks with his girl friends on phone and in person.

The appellant has challenged legality & propriety of the judgment & decree on the ground that the parties are Muslim legally wedded spouses, the Family Court was not having jurisdiction to entertain suit for declaration of marriage to be void under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Family Court has also erred in holding that marriage has not been solemnized between the parties. 5. Brief facts necessary for the disposal of these appeals, as per pleadings of the parties in Civil Suit No.158A/2007, are that the respondent is a Hindu woman and never converted into Islam. The appellant is a member of Islam. The respondent was working as Shiksha Karmi at Village Badepurda and she used to travel from Durg to Litia Chowk by mini bus of Zia Travels. The appellant was working as Checker in Zia Travels. During the course of travel, they came in contact. On 3-8-2006 while the respondent was travelling in the mini bus of Zia Travels, the appellant provided one chocolate of Dairy Milk to the respondent which she accepted and ate, and she became unconscious. In the evening the respondent came back to her house. She used to travel by the same bus till 20-11-2006. On 22-11-2006, the appellant for the first time told the respondent that he has married her on 3-8-2006 at madarsa situate at Gandai and also showed the certificate relating to nikah. The appellant threatened her and compelled her for registration of marriage at Durg. He also showed photographs. Under duress, the respondent went with the appellant to the Office of Collector, Durg where 3-4 other persons were present. The appellant took signatures of the respondent on some papers and detained her till 3 p.m. The appellant also took some photographs of the respondent. On 22-11-2006, with a view to avoid to go to the Collectorate, Durg, the respondent went to Dhamdha to attend strike, but the appellant reached there at 2 p.m. by motorcycle and forcefully took her to the Marriage Officer at Durg who issued certificate of marriage. The respondent was under duress. Lastly, on 23-11-2006, she narrated the entire incident to her parents. She claims that she never converted into Islam and never consented for marriage with the appellant. The alleged marriage between the parties is void ab initio and the marriage certificate issued by the Marriage Officer is also void. On the aforesaid ground, suit for declaration of marriage & marriage certificate void was filed by the respondent under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 read with Sections 11 & 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 6. The appellant has denied the allegations made in the plaint and has specifically alleged that the respondent used to travel by Zia Travels and during the course of travel, the appellant & the respondent came in contact during which period their relation developed. The respondent used to send SMS and talk with the appellant from her mobile phone No.98279-20460 on his mobile phone Nos.93028-36432 & 94255- 64469. On 3-8-2006, the respondent herself came to the appellant near Kachehri Chowk and she herself willfully went to Gandai by Scorpio vehicle along with the appellant where she converted herself into Islam and filed affidavit for marriage with the appellant, before other persons. Marriage between the appellant & the respondent was performed at Gandai. The respondent herself has decided not to inform the factum of marriage to her parents till registration of marriage. The respondent was party to the marriage and marriage of the respondent with the appellant was well within her knowledge since 3-8-2006. On 21-11-2006, the respondent along with the appellant went to the Collectorate for registration of their marriage. Both the parties presented application for registration of marriage and next date of 22- 11-2006 was fixed by the Marriage Officer. On 22-11-2006, the respondent was present at Dhamdha in connection with strike fromAsfaq Qureshi vs Aysha Qureshi on 19 March, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1426063/ 2where she called the appellant from STD booth and she came from Dhamdha to Collectorate for registration of marriage where marriage was registered and registration certificate was issued to them. The appellant has specifically alleged that the respondent herself has converted into Islam willfully and after her conversion, she had married the appellant under her free consent, therefore, she is not entitled for declaration of marriage to be void. 7. On the basis of averments, issues were framed and after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties, the Family Court has allowed the suit for declaration of marriage and marriage certificate as null & void. 8. Vide Civil Suit No.157A/2007, the appellant has filed petition for restitution of conjugal rights under Chapter VIII of the Muslim law. The appellant has specifically alleged that the respondent is legally married wife of the appellant under the Muslim law. Marriage was performed on 3- 8-2006 at Gandai madarsa. Parties had agreed that they will enjoy their marital life peacefully after registration of marriage. On 22-11-2006, marriage between the parties was registered, but even after registration of marriage, parents of the respondent are not permitting the respondent for discharging her marital obligations and have detained her. The respondent has filed petition for declaration of marriage null & void at the instance and under the pressure of her parents. The appellant is ready & willing to discharge his marital obligations. On the aforesaid basis, suit for restitution of conjugal rights was filed on behalf of the appellant. 9. The respondent has denied the allegations and has specifically pleaded that she is Hindu, she has never converted into Islam and registration of Muslim marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was not legally possible. She has already filed petition for declaration of marriage void. She has specifically pleaded that there was no marriage or lawful marriage between the parties and therefore, restitution of conjugal rights would not be legally permissible. 10. On the basis of averments of the parties, issues were framed and after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties, the Family Court by common judgment & decree dated 6- 2-2008 passed in Civil Suit Nos.157A/2007 & 158A/2007, has dismissed the suit for restitution of conjugal rights and allowed the suit for declaration of marriage null & void. 11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the judgment & decree impugned and records of the Family Court. 12. Mrs. Fouzia Mirza, learned counsel for the appellant, vehemently argued that the appellant has married the respondent, both are majors and competent to give consent. The respondent was previously known to the appellant, they were having cordial terms and had decided to marry. The respondent voluntarily and willfully went with the appellant to Gandai, she converted herself into Islam and after her conversion she contracted marriage with the appellant in accordance with Muslim law (nikah) on 3-8-2006. After solemnization of marriage, both the parties applied for registration of marriage before the Registering Officer at Durg, finally, the marriage was registered on 22-11-2006 and marriage certificate was issued, but parents of the respondent are not permitting the respondent to discharge her marital obligations and have unnecessarily detained her with them.Asfaq Qureshi vs Aysha Qureshi on 19 March, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1426063/ 3",['19']

Sinha, C.J. 1. Whether an Interlocutory Application for grant of interim maintenance to a Hindu wife and her mentally retarded minor child towards provision of food, clothing as well as medical attendance and treatment and education to the child, filed in a suit brought under the provisions of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (for short 'the Act') for maintenance against the husband, can be entertained by a Court therefor in exercise of the inherent powers of the Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, despite the absence of a specific provision in this behalf in the Act, is the question involved in this Civil Revision Petition. FACTS: 2. The 1st respondent herein was married to the petitioner on 22-10-1986 as per Hindu rites and customs. Out of the said wedlock, 2nd respondent was born. He is mentally retarded. The 1st respondent was allegedly being harassed by the petitioner. Her parents were unable to meet the demands of her husband and in-laws for more and more amount of dowry although a huge amount had been paid at the time of the marriage. Allegedly, even the 2nd respondent was not being provided with any medical treatment. It is alleged that the petitioner deserted the respondents. Therefore, they filed a suit in the Court of Judge, Family Court, City Civil Court for grant of maintenance at the rate of Rs.2,500/- per month under the provisions of the Act. 3. An application for grant of interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 1500/- per month was filed which was marked as IA No.468 of 2000. The 2nd respondent was studying in the Special Education Centre for mentally handicapped Institute of Genetics, Hyderabad in Primary-II. 4. The learned Judge, Family Court, on a prima facie consideration of the material placed before him, by reason of the impugned order dated 24-6-2001, directed payment of Rs. 1000/- per month towards interim maintenance. Questioning the said order, this revision petition has been filed. SUBMISSIONS: 5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner would urge that in a suit for maintenance under the provisions of the Act, no application for interim maintenance would be maintainable. The Judge, Family Court has no jurisdiction to pass an interim order of the nature under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned Counsel in support of the said contention has placed strong reliance on G. Appanna v. G. Seethamma, , Ramchandra v. Snehalata Dei, and A. Subrahmanyam v. A. Rama Devi, .P. Srinivasa Rao vs P. Indira And Anr. on 22 November, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1198203/ 16. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, would submit that the petitioner as husband and father had a statutory obligation to maintain the respondents. The right of wife and a minor child to be maintained under the Act cannot be postponed till the determination of the issue on merits. The learned Counsel would urge that if the respondents have been able to show that they were not being maintained by the petitioner, they are entitled to be granted interim maintenance pendente lite. Therefore, it is one of such circumstances where the Court would be entitled to pass an order ex debito justitiae particularly when the relationship between the parties is admitted. 7. In the instant case, the petitioner does not dispute the solemnisation and consummation of the marriage with the 1st respondent and his statutory obligation to maintain his wife and son. His contention before the learned Judge, Family Court, as also before us is that an application for interim maintenance under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not maintainable. STATUTORY PROVISIONS: 8. The Parliament enacted Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 codifying the law relating to adoption and maintenance among Hindus. 9. Section 18 of the Act, which provides for maintenance of wife, reads as follows: (1) Subject to the provisions of this Court, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. (2) A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim to maintenance- (a) if he is guilty of desertion, that is to say, of abandoning her without reasonable cause and without her consent or against her wish or of wilfully neglecting her; (b) if he has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with her husband; (c) if he is suffering from virulent form of leprosy; (d) if he has any other wife living; (e) if he keeps a concubine in the same house in which his wife if living or habitually resides with a concubine elsewhere; (f) if he has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion; (g) if there is any other cause justifying her living separately.P. Srinivasa Rao vs P. Indira And Anr. on 22 November, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1198203/ 2(3) A Hindu wife shall not be entitled to separate residence and maintenance from her husband if she is unchaste or ceases to be a Hindu by conversion to other religion. 10. Therefore, under Sub-section (1) of Section 18 a Hindu wife is entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime and under Sub-section (2) she is also entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim to maintenance in the circumstances enumerated under clauses (a) to (g) therein. Under Section 20 of the Act, the children or the aged parents are entitled to be maintained. Under clause (b) of Section 3, 'maintenance' has been defined in the following terms: ""Maintenance"" includes, -- (i) in all cases, provision for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment; (ii) in the case of an unmarried daughter, also the reasonable expenses of and incident to her marriage. 11. The petitioner, therefore, was under an obligation to make provision to his wife and minor child for food, clothing, residence, education as well as medical attendance and treatment. 12. Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, where proceedings are pending a Hindu wife is entitled to seek for maintenance pendente lite as also the expenses of proceedings. Admittedly, at the time the respondents filed the suit before the Family Court, Hyderabad no proceeding was pending before the Court under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, it appears that the petitioner on 18-4-2001 filed a petition being OP No. 21 of 2001 on the file of the Senior Civil Judge, Avanigadda under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, for restitution of the conjugal rights. FINDINGS: 13. The jurisdiction of a Court to pass an interim order under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is no longer res integra. In Manoharlal v. Seth Hiralal, , the Apex Court has clearly held that where an order of injunction cannot be passed in terms of Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code, an application for interim relief can be entertained by the Court in terms of Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure. The said decision has been followed by the Apex Court and High Courts in a number of decisions. 14. In G. Appanna's case, Chinnappa Reddy, J (as his Lordship then was) speaking for a Division Bench of this Court held that Section 18 of the Act does not authorise the award of interim maintenance pending decision of suit in which the very claim to maintenance is in contest. The teamed Judge relied upon a decision of the Madras High Court in Abdul Rehman v. Tajunissa Begum, , wherein a similar question arose for consideration. In the said case, a learned Judge of the Madras High Court sitting on the original side of the High Court granted interim maintenance but inP. Srinivasa Rao vs P.

The petitioner alleged that she was sent to have parental home by the husband-respondent on 26-7-2000 and the petitioner had to depend on her father. The petitioner did not pay the single farthing to the petitioner even if when she became ill, her medical expenses were not also borne by the husband. According to the petitioner, she was tortured when she was in the matrimonial home and ultimately when the petitioner was forced to go to her parental house the respondent did not pay or did not look after the petitioner and as such the petitioner had to pass her days with great financial hardship. In such a circumstance the petitioner filed an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 claiming alimony pendente lite and the said petition filed in the said Matrimonial Suit was numbered as Misc.

The husband-respondent has also filed an application for maintenance against the wife claiming that the wife is a graduate and out of private tuition she earns Rs. 5000/- per month and the husband has claimed maintenance of Rs. 2000/- per month from the wife. The husband-respondent filed objection before the trial Court to the application for maintenance filed by the petitioner under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In the said objection the husband-respondent submitted that he was the store-in-charge of Garrison Engineering Company. The petitioner-wife filed a criminal case before Maniktala Police Station and the respondent-husband was arrested in connection with the said criminal case and when he came out on bail his service was terminated and since then he is unemployed and moving like a vagabond. The respondent-husband also filed an application for maintenance claiming alimony to the tune of Rs. 2000/- per month and alleging that since the wife-petitioner is earning Rs. 5000/- per month out of private coaching, he is entitled to get maintenance. After hearing the wife-petitioner and the husband-O.P. before the trial Court, the learned Trial Judge rejected both the petitions -- one filed by the petitioner-wife and the other filed by the husband-respondent. 2. Challenging the aforesaid rejection order the wife has come to this Court. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the learned Trial Judge did not exercise his jurisdiction properly and without any application of mind or without considering the provision of statute or without considering the evidence on record, the learned Trial Judge passed the ImpugnedSmt. Chandana Guha Roy vs Goutam Guha Roy on 26 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1542291/ 1order. The learned Counsel submits that the learned Trial Judge should have considered that in view of the provisions of Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act the burden of proof of income of the husband was lying with the husband since the fact of his income and the quantum of his income cannot be within the knowledge in specific of the wife-petitioner. The learned Counsel for the petitioner also submits that the basis of the impugned order is surmise and not evidence on record. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that the wife as disclosed certain income of the husband and thereafter the husband-respondent should have disclosed in evidence regarding his actual income. The learned Counsel for the petitioner also submitted that the learned Trial Judge went on wrong in deciding that since the petitioner is an Arts Graduate she cannot sit idle and arrived at a wrong presumption that she must have some earning. The learned Counsel also submits that the learned Trial Judge failed to consider that the husband-respondent is also a Diploma Engineer and if the Arts Graduate can have some earning the Diploma Engineer cannot be also a vagabond. The learned Counsel placed reliance on a judgment , Chitra Sengupta v. Dhrubajyoti Sengupta. In this judgment the Hon'ble Division Bench of this High Court observed ""but that apart, monthly income of a husband may not very often be within the knowledge of the wife, particularly in a case like this where the relation is considerably strained and the spouses are living a part for a considerably long period"". The Hon'ble Division Bench also observed that onus under Section 106 of the Evidence Act would be on the husband to disclose the same and if he fails to do so without any good reasons, the Court would be entitled to presume against him and to accept the allegations of the wife as to the amount of income derived from such reasonable sources as would be available to her. The Hon'ble Division Bench in this case quoting from a decision reported in AIR 1917 Privy Council (sic) observed ""a practice has grown up in Indian Procedure of those in possession of important documents or information lying by, trusting to the abstract doctrine of the onus of proof, and failing accordingly to furnish to the Courts the best material for this decision. With regard to third parties, this may be right enough; they have no responsibility for the conduct of the suit; but with regard to the parties to the suit it is, in Their Lordships opinion, an inversion of sound practice for those desiring to rely upon a certain state of facts to withhold from the Court the written evidence in their possession which would throw light upon the proposition."" 4. The Hon'ble Division Bench also observed that these observations were endorsed by the Privy Council again in Rameswar Sing v. Bajit Lal Pathak AIR 1929 Privy Council 95 at page 99 and having been quoted with the approval by the Supreme Court in Hiralal v. Badkulal, Their Lordships observed ""we are of opinion that as a matter of onus under Section 106 of the Evidence Act and also otherwise under the principle enunciated in the aforesaid decisions of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court, it was for the husband to disclose his income and he not having done that and not having also specifically denied the amount alleged by the wife to be his income, we would have to go by such allegation for the purpose of this application. The learned Counsel for the petitioner then relied' in another decision of Hon'ble Division Bench reported in 1986 (90) CWN 816, Somen Ghosh v. Bani Ghosh (nee Sen). The learned Counsel relied on Paragraphs 4 and 5 of this judgment which is quoted hereinbelow :-- ""4. The Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, has been given a wide discretion in the matter of granting alimony pendente lite but the discretion is judicial and not arbitrary or capricious. It is to be guided on sound principles of matrimonial laws and to be exercised within theSmt. Chandana Guha Roy vs Goutam Guha Roy on 26 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1542291/ 2ambit of the provisions of the section and having regard to the object of the Act' (vide Mulla's Hindu Law, 15th Ed. Page 873). In fixing the sum of maintenance and legal expenses to be paid to the petitioner, who makes an application under Section 24 of the Act, the Court shall have regard to the petitioner's own income and income of the respondent. But we are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Mukherjee on behalf of the petitioner, that as there was no evidence that his client was receiving any income or salary, no order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act ought to have been made in favour of the wife, the opposite party to the Revisional Application. Mr. Mukherjee in this connection had drawn our attention to the discussion under the heading ""Has No Independent Income Sufficient"" in Mulla's Hindu Law, 15th Ed. Pages 872-73. The said passage does not really support the contentions of Mr. Mukherjee. Because it has been observed therein : ""It is also implicit in the section that the order would not be made if the respondent to the application is shown to have no property nor earning capacity or is shown to have very small income. But the fact that the respondent is not receiving any income from property for the time being would not be sufficient answers to the claim....................."". Reference may also be made to the discussion on the point at Page 885 of the aforesaid book on the subject of assessment of quantum of maintenance payable under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned author has inter alia observed : ""It would also be open to take into account the earning capacity of the husband as well as the wife. The Court has ample discretion and in a deserving case may ascertained not. only what money's the husband had but what money he could have had if he liked and take into consideration his capacity and ability to provide maintenance. The Court will look at the realities and not permit itself to be misled by appear ances"". Rayden on Divorce, Vol. I, 13th Edn. in Notes at Pages 872-873 with reference to the provisions of Matrimonial Clauses Act, 1973 makes similar observations. 5.5 In the Instant case, the husband was undisputedly at one time employed in a company named Kohinoor Rubber Works. In her evidence given in the Court below the wife had no doubt stated that she did not know where her husband worked now. In her cross-examination, she had denied the suggestion that her husband was out of employment. Although in his evidence the husband, Samar Ghosh, had claimed that he was not employed at present and had to tender resignation as his wife and others held out threats. But he had admitted that he had no paper to show that he had left his work. He also admitted that he had no wit ness for living his job or to show what was his salary. He had also admitted that he got a job at Raniganj but he had left it due to threats by the other party. Again, he had no paper or witness to show that he had lost this job also. In all likelihood, there would be papers in case he had resigned his job. But he did not adduce either oral or documentary evidence to corroborate his claim that he was out of employment. The husband was an ablebodied youngman of about 34 years of age, Although there was no evidence before the Court below of the actual income, if any earned by him, the Court below legitimately could take into consideration his ability to earn a reasonable amount of income."" 5. The learned counsel then relied on the decision (Sm. Urmila Devi v. Hari Parkash Bansal). In this judgment it has been observed ; ""Thus, if a person is an ablebodied person can be all working, then he suppose to maintain his wife and to pay the maintenance as required under Section 24. It is for the purpose of fixing the amount under Section 24 that the applicant shown income and that of the respondent is to be taken into consideration. In the absence of any income as such of either party is the husband being an ablebodied person and can be all working can be considered as capable ofSmt.

This petition has been placed before us pursuant to the order passed by learned Chief Justice as a result of the order dated 19th April, 1995 passed by G.R. Majithia, J., since the learned Judge thought that the view taken by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Sharadchandra Satbhai v. Indubai Satbhai, 1978 Mh.L.J. 123 required reconsideration in view of the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Bai Tahira v. Ali Hussian Fissalli Chothia, . Majithia, J., observed that the question as to whether a divorced wife has a right to claim maintenance under section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was important. He, therefore, directed the office to place the matter before the learned Chief Justice. Consequently, the matter has been placed before us for final hearing. 3. In the facts of the case before us the short question which arises for our consideration is whether the first respondent wife against whom the petitioner has obtained a decree for divorce is entitled to get maintenance under section 125 of the 1973 Code, The question really revolves around the interpretation of Clause (b) of the Explanation to sub-section (1) of section 125 of the Code. Section 125 reads as under : ""125. (1) If any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain (a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or (b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself or (c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or (d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself. A Magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, at such monthly rate not exceeding five hundred rupees in the whole, as such Magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct;Bhagwan Raoji Dale vs Sushma Alias Nanda Bhagwan Dale on 17 April, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1098370/ 1Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in Clause (b) to make such allowance, until she attains her majority if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if married, is not possessed of sufficient means. Explanation:- For the purpose of this chapter. (a) ""minor"" means a person who, under the provisions of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 is deemed not to have attained majority : (b) ""wife"" includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not remarried. (2) Such allowance shall be payable from the date of the order, or if so ordered from the date of the application for maintenance. (3) If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order, any such Magistrate may, for every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines, and may sentence such person, for the whole or any part of each month's allowance remaining unpaid after the execution of the warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or until payment if sooner made : Provided that no warrant shall be issued for the recovery of any amount due under this section unless application be made to the Court to levy such amount within a period of one year from the date on which it became due : Provided further that if such person offers to maintain his wife on condition of her living with him, and she refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order under this section notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing. Explanation:---If a husband has contracted marriage with another woman or keeps a mistress, it shall be considered to be just ground for his wife's refused to live with him. (4) No wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. (5) On proof that any wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section is living in adultery, or that without sufficient reason she refuses to live with her husband, or that they are living separately by mutual consent, the Magistrate shall cancel the order."" 4. Before adverting to the question of law it is necessary to set out the facts in brief.Bhagwan Raoji Dale vs Sushma Alias Nanda Bhagwan Dale on 17 April, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1098370/ 25. The petitioner married the first respondent at Malegaon in District Nasik on 19th December, 1974. The wife left the husband's house on or about 4th May, 1978 and never went back to the matrimonial home. The husband filed Hindu Marriage Petition No. 133 of 1978 on 12th June, 1978 in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhule for restitution of conjugal rights alleging that the wife had deserted him without any reasonable cause and without his consent and against his wish. The husband alleged that the wife left the house leaving a writing that she was suffering from Tuber culosis and, therefore, was leaving the house and no attempt should be made to trace her. However, the husband brought her back from the State Transport Bus Stand; called her father who took her to his house for curing her ailment. However, the wife's father informed the petitioner that the wife had no desire to go back to the matrimonial home. The husband issued notice to the wife. The wife did not respond. Hence the husband filed the petition for restitution of conjugal rights on 12th June, 1998. 6. Pending the petition for restitution of conjugal rights, the wife initiated the present proceedings for maintenance under section 125 of the Code on 6th of February, 1979 before the J.M.F.C., Malegaon being Maintenance Application No. 30 of 1979. The wife alleged in her application that the husband was ill-treating her and was making unlawful demand of some valuable articles from her and had asked her father to take her away when her father took her to his house, the husband did not make any attempt to bring her back to the matrimonial home nor did he care to provide for maintenance for her. It was alleged that the husband was having a cycle shop and was earning about Rs. 5,000/- per month and, therefore, the wife should get maintenance of Rs. 500/- per month. 7. The husband resisted the application for maintenance and denied the allegations made against him. He contended that the wife had left the matrimonial home without any valid reason and though it was decided that she will come back from her father's house within a short time, she failed to do so. The petitioner contended that he had gone on several occasions to his father-in-law's house to bring his wife back but she refused to return to the matrimonial home. 8. Pending the application for maintenance, the Hindu Marriage petition, for restitution of conjugal rights was taken up for hearing. Though the wife was served with the petition, she remained absent. Issues were framed as to whether the wife had withdrawn from the society of her husband without a valid reason and whether the husband was entitled to restitution of conjugal rights. Both the issues were answered in favour of the husband and a decree for restitution of conjugal rights was passed on 31st July, 1979. The husband filed execution proceedings on 24th January, 1980, being Regular Darkhast No. 32 of 1980 but the wife failed to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. This led to the husband's filing Hindu Marriage Petition No. 264 of 1980 on 1st August, 1980 in the Court of the Assistant Judge, Dhule. The husband relied upon the earlier decree passed in the petition for restitution of conjugal rights on 31st July, 1979, the filing of Regular Darkhast No. 32 of 1980 and the failure on the part of the wife to comply with the said decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Despite service of notice of the petition for divorce, the wife remained absent at the trial. The learned Assistant Judge by his judgment and decree dated 3rd December, 1980 decreed the petition for divorce.Bhagwan Raoji Dale vs Sushma Alias Nanda Bhagwan Dale on 17 April, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1098370/ 3",['12']

The appellant in this case is Dr. Sachindra Nath Chatterjee, M.B. and D.T.M. (Calcutta), D.M.R. (Madras), D.M.R.T. (England), and Reader, Radiotherapy, Medical College, Calcutta, and the respondent is his wife, Sm. Nilima Chatterjee; they are referred to hereinafter as simply Sachindra and Nilima. 2. Sachindra is now about fifty-five and Nilima fifty years of age. 3. The appeal is brought from a Judgment and decree dated December 16, 1964, of a learned Additional District Judge, Alipore, dismissing Sachindra's petition dated January 19. 1962, for divorce on the ground of Nilima's adultery: just the ground under Section 13, Sub-section (1), Clause (i), of the Hindu Marriage Act 25 of 1955, or, in the alternative, for Judicial separation on the ground of ""severe cruelty and tremendous torture"" by her.: just the ground under Section 10, Subsection (1), Clause (b), thereof. 4. Sachindra and Nilima, Hindus both, and domiciled in India too, were married In accordance with Hindu rites, some thirty-two years ago from today, to be exact, on Asarh 14,1344 B.S., corresponding to June 28, 1937, in the town of Barisal, now in East Pakistan. Sachindra, then an M.Sc. student, was about twenty-three and Nilima, then or thereabouts a matriculate, eighteen years of age. 5. Nilima's father had died long before her marriage. She was, therefore, brought up by her mother's father, Chandrakanta Chakrabarti, a practising muktear of the Barisal courts at the relevant time. Indeed, in his house at Barisal the marriage was solemnized. 6. The ceremony of marriage over, Nilima moved, as usual, to Sachindra's ancestral home at Bakal, also In the district of Barisal or Backarganj, as it is called, and continued living there, broken by periodic visits to her grandfather Chandrakanta's place. Sachindra was with her too at Bakal, but only for thirteen days, after which he returned to Calcutta, as indeed he had to, leaving Nilima behind, with a view to prosecuting Ms studies. Prosecute that he did on return to Calcutta But soon enough the course he was in, did undergo a change. A change, because he discontinued reading for M.Sc., and, in 1938, got into the medical college instead. There he had continued until 1944 when he passed the M.B. examination. Having graduated so, he worked there as house physician and house surgeon until 1946's end or thereabouts. Then, he took to studies again --this time for the D.T.M. course --until April 1947, and, in due course, obtained the diploma he was working for. But there he did not rest. From July 1947 to June 1948 he was in Madras, ""doing"" the D.M.R. course, and succeeded in getting this diploma as well.Sachindranath Chatterjee vs Sm. Nilima Chatterjee on 16 May, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176124/ 17. Passing by, for the time being, still another feather in his cap --a D.M.R.T.--which he earned In England, after having stayed and toiled there from March 1956 to February 1958 or thereabouts, it is time now to notice, in the barest outline, how the connubial relation developed between the two spouses, Sachindra having left Nilima, his newly wedded wife, at Bakal, only thirteen days after the marriage. While in the medical college --and Sachindra was there, first as a student from 1938 to 1944, and then as a house physician and the like until 1946's end --he did visit Nilima at Bakal, but only once or twice a year, and that too for not more than eight to ten days at a time. Nilima in turn, did come from Bakal to Sachindra's Calcutta residence at 4D Mohanlal Street (shortened hereafter into ""4D"") in the northern part of the town and so close to a well known park of the locality the Deshabandhu Park. Such visits, however, by her to Sachindra here in Calcutta were very few, only three or four, and for short duration as well on each occasion. Only in July 1948 she was ""permanently shifted"" to ""4D"" --an address which bulks large in this matrimonial litigation, so unpleasant and unfortunate. 8. There were three children of the marriage --two daughters and a son --when Nilima had shifted so, and at last found her normal abode with the husband, some eleven years after her wedding. The children are -- 1. Khana, a daughter, twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, on March 24, 1964, when Sachindra was giving evidence at the trial, and, therefore, born in or about 1938. 1937 the year of birth cannot possibly be, her parents having been married only on June 28, 1937. 2. Reba, also called Krishna, another daughter, twenty-one or twenty-two years of age on the same date, and, therefore, born in 1942 or 1943, going by Sachindra's evidence. Reba, however, says, on cross-examination, her precise date of birth to be July 2, 1943. It does not matter which. 3. Parma, a son, aged eighteen on March, 24, 1964, as spoken to by Sachindra in his evidence, and, therefore, born in or about 1946. 9. Naturally, these three children of the marriage were ""permanently shifted"" too, along with their mother, from Bakal to ""4D"" in July 1948, when they were not even in their teens, having been no more than about ten, five and two years of age respectively. 10. There is another issue of the marriage yet: a boy Chanchal by name, aged fourteen on March 24, 1964, as is the evidence on that date of Sachindra. That makes the year of his birth 1950 or thereabouts. 11. More, to Dr. Shantipada Ganguli, an LMF in the beginning, but later an M.B.B.S., thanks to the condensed course, Khana, the first-born, was married on July 1, 1955, when she was some seventeen years of age. What is still more, Dr. Ganguli, now Reader and Head of the Department of Radiology in the College of Medical Science, Varanasi, had his early training on the subject in the chambers of his father-in-law, Sachindra, who did not stop at that, but had sent him to England, bearing all his expenses, so that he could qualify himself for B.M.R.D. (London), which he did.Sachindranath Chatterjee vs Sm. Nilima Chatterjee on 16 May, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176124/ 212. Prom the little that goes before, one should have thought: here was a happy home, the usual wear and tear of a married life notwithstanding. And a married life which is above wear and tear must be rare indeed. Then, on January 19, 1962, when the two spouses were in their forties, Sachindra having been forty-eight and Nilima forty-three years old, married for about a quarter of century, with passions necessarily in a state of greater composure, blessed with four children, the oldest of whom was about twenty-four and the youngest twelve years of age, having in addition the gift of a grandchild, the child of Khana and Dr. Ganguli, referred to by both Sachindra and Nilima in a common letter bearing date March 3, 1959, to Dr. Ganguli, then in London, exhibits A (3) and A(4) as ""Dadubhal"", a term by which a grandchild is petted by his grandparents, Sachindra informing his son-in-law of the stay of Khana and her child with them at ""4D"" (which is in Shambazar) for about a week with a view to restoring ""Dadubhai's"" health, gone down for sometime past, and when the male spouse Sachindra had earned name and fame, as also lucre, in his profession as a radiologist, the marriage, one should have thought again, was brought to a high pitch of success. But, on that very day, namely, on January 19, 1962, Sachindra raised his action for divorce or judicial separation -- an action we are now adjudicating in appeal. Why such action? Sachindra answers it in one way, and Nilima answers it, as is only to be expected, in a way exactly the opposite. But both rest their answers on a common event which is as uncommon as breathtaking. 13. And that uncommonly common event (as alleged) came into view on January 28, 1961, when Reba alias Krishna, whose acquaintance we have just made, and who was then a little less than eighteen years of age, lodged a complaint before the police that her father, Sachindra, had attempted to commit rape on her nearly a year back namely, on March 10, 1960. Sachindra, twenty-three years old on June 28, 1937, the date of his marriage, was forty-six or thereabouts on March 10, 1960. It was in sober truth a most astounding complaint, leading to Sachindra's arrest three days later, that is to say, on January 31, 1961, and his production before the magistrate on the day following, when he was enlarged on bail. On April 5, 1961, his house at ""4D"" was searched. That very day, Nilima left ""4D"". Investigation of the complaint completed, a charge-sheet was submitted against Sachindra under Section 376 of the Penal Code for the offence of rape on his daughter Reba alias Krishna on March 10, 1960, not merely an attempt to commit rape. In due course, he was committed to the court of session, where he stood his trial thereunder and was acquitted on December 23, 1961. 14. Such is the event --that there was a prosecution as above culminating in Sachindra's acquittal is not in the realm of controversy --upon which each party relies in its own way. What Sachindra says comes to this: ""My wife is a nymphomaniac, more or less. I have been putting up with her sexual lapses ever since July 1941. But the one on January 1, 1961, broke me, and I gave out, I would go to law with her for divorce. That led her to bolster against me the false and agonizing prosecution she did, through Reba, with a view to forestalling my action for divorce and forcing me 'with the assistance of the police to agree to the terms dictated by her'. Hence this matrimonial cause by me on January 19, 1962, only twenty-seven days after my acquittal --a cause which I could not have very well initiated during the continuance of the criminal case against me on a most heinous charge, and a false charge at that."" What Nilima says comes to this: ""Nothing of the nymphomania in me, but satyriasis, so to say, in my husband who used to revel in sexual intercourse with all sorts of women, sparing not even his near relations of all degrees. Such a one, so difficult to get on with, encouraged and emboldened by the failure of the prosecution against him, true though it was, has raised thisSachindranath Chatterjee vs Sm.

Sitting in the Habeas Corpus jurisdiction, we frequently came across cases filed by young men between 21 and 25 contending that, the given detenue is his wife having married and registered the marriage either in the Office of the Marriage Registrar, Chennai North (Joint-I) or Marriage Registrar, Royapuram, and further alleging that the parents are keeping the detenue in illegal custody. 2. On the strength of the Marriage Certificate produced by the petitioner, we were routinely issuing Rule Nisi for the production of the detenue in order to check if she was in the illegal custody of her parents. In several cases we found the detenue, when produced before us, telling that she has not undergone any solemnisation of marriage with the petitioner and even repudiated the very Certificate of Marriage as a bogus one. 3. In HCP No.2767/2013, S.Balakrishnan Pandiyan, the petitioner, has stated in his affidavit that he hails from Theni District and had fallen in love with the detenue and that they got married on 14.06.2013 at Arulmighu Vadapalani Murugan Temple in Chennai and that the marriage was registered under the Tamil Nadu Registration of Marriage Act, 2009 with the Registrar ofS.Balakrishnan Pandiyan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 17 October, 2014 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24786693/ 2Marriages, Chennai North (Joint-I), on the same day. We issued notice to the respondents and directed production of the detenue. The detenue appeared before us on 05.12.2013 and told us that, though she knew the petitioner, she had not married him at all and the Marriage Certificate that was produced in support of the claim of marriage has been obtained without her knowledge and consent. 4. On carefully scrutinizing the Marriage Certificate, we found that the place of solemnisation of the marriage has been given as No.154, Angappa Naicken Street, Chennai 600 001, whereas, in the affidavit of the petitioner he has stated that he got married in Arulmighu Vadapalani Murugan Temple, which is at Vadapalani and not anywhere near the address given in the Marriage Certificate. All this aroused strong suspicion in our mind and therefore, we passed a detailed order on 05.12.2013, the relevant portion of which is extracted below: ""5. Before parting with the matter, we find that almost in all Habeas Corpus Petitions where the boys/husbands, alleged to have married the detenues/young girls, produce Marriage Certificates in proof of their marriage issued by the Sub Registrar, Royapuram. After notice, the detenues come before this Court and deny any relationship with the boys. Whereas, the boys state that the said Marriage Certificates have been obtained with the consent and knowledge of the detenues/girls. We do not know how these Certificates are issued by a Government Office, without any proper identification and verification of the parties concerned. Moreover, the issuance of such Marriage Certificates by the said office would also impair the reputation and status of the girl's family. Besides that, the said certificates can also be utilised by the alleged husband by filing cases and the girl's family will be unnecessarily put to great difficulty and hardship on account of that. It is further informed that there are other two institutions, viz., [1] a Christian Organisation functioning in Royapuram, Chennai and [2] a Hindu Organisation functioning in Kodambakkam, Chennai, who do solemnise such marriages and issue certificates, similar to the one issued by the Sub Registrar, Royapuram. Since this has become an order of the day, we would like to take serious note of this fact and to consider passing appropriate orders. 6. Therefore, in order to nip it in the bud, we direct the DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, CBCID HEADQUARTERS, SIDCO ELECTRONIC COMPLEX, GUINDY, CHENNAI -600 032 to appoint a competent authority in the rank of the Superintendent of Police, to enquire into the matter, viz., to find out the modus operandi of these offices as to how they issue such Marriage Certificates; whether the parties are appearing before them and signing any register, whether the consent of the girls are obtained, so on. The Superintendent of Police concerned shall enquire these aspects and submit a report in this regard to this Court in a SEALED COVER within a period of thirty days [30 days] from today to enable this Court to pass appropriate orders."" 5. In HCP No.2141/2014, R.Ram Prasath, the petitioner, has stated that he was in love with the detenue and they both got married on 30.06.2014, which was registered in the Office of Registrar of Marriages, Chennai North, (Joint-I) on the same day and that after the marriage, the detenue went back to her parents house. He has further alleged in his affidavit that the parents of the detenue are keeping her in illegal custody and trying to get her forcibly married to someone and therefore, he has sought for issuance of Writ of Habeas Corpus for her production and release from illegal detention.

For Petitioner  :  Ms.K.M.Nalinishree                         For 2nd Respondent  :  Mr.K.Kannan O R D E R The petitioner has sought for a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the first respondent from proceeding with the trial in O.P.No.569 of 2004 on its file. 2. Facts leading to the present Writ Petition are as follows: The petitioner is a domicile in United States of America, since 1992 and is working as a Software Engineer. The second respondent is known to their family since childhood. Marriage between the parties to this lis was arranged by elders. The second respondent, her parents and relatives came to United States and the marriage was performed on 17.04.2002 and registered on 30.07.2002. The second respondent came to India in the second week of January 2003 for a short visit promising to return after completing a dance programme. But she began to act in films and with ulterior motive,R.Sridharan vs The Presiding Officer on 18 August, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114292955/ 1she filed O.P.NO.569 of 2004 on the file of the Principal Family Court, Chennai for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, alleging cruelty. Since he was residing in United States, summons were not served and therefore, the second respondent obtained an exparte decree of divorce on 19.07.2004. On his application, the order was set aside on 23.09.2004 and the O.P., was restored. Apprehending trial, the second respondent adopted dilatory tactics and filed C.R.P.(PD)No.1695 of 2004, stating that the proceedings of the Family Court should not be published by the Media and obtained an interim stay. The petitioner has filed a counter affidavit, stating that he has no objection for the proceedings be held in camera and did not want any publicity. Therefore, by order dated 29.10.2004, this Court vacated the interim stay and the O.P., was ready for trial. Inspite of several adjournments, the second respondent has not appeared and in these circumstances, the petitioner was constrained to file the present Writ Petition for Prohibition, prohibiting the Family Court from proceeding with the trial in O.P.NO.56 of 2004. 3. According to the petitioner, the Family Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, since the marriage was performed in United States of America. After the marriage, the petitioner and the second respondent were living as husband and wife in U.S.A and the petitioner, being an American citizen, the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 will not apply. The petitioner has further submitted that he is a domicile in United States of America and not in the territory of India and therefore, Section 1(2) of the Act would come into operation and in the above circumstances, the Family Court at Chennai cannot maintain a petition for divorce. The petitioner has further submitted that unless both the parties are domiciled in India, the petition for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act is not maintainable. 4. The Second respondent in her counter affidavit has submitted that she got married to the petitioner on 17.04.2002 in Balaji Temple, Bridge Water, New Jercy, U.S.A., in the presence of their parents and relatives, as per Hindu Rites and Customs. Therefore, she has submitted that the rights and the obligations of the parties flow from the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. As per Section 19(iii)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, inserted by Act 50 of the Central Act, with effect from 20.12.2003, she can institute the proceedings for dissolution of the Marriage at the place where she is residing at the time of presentation of the petition and therefore, the Family Court at Chennai, is competent to decide the lis between the parties. 5. The Second respondent, while rebutting the averments made in Paragraph 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d) of the affidavit filed by the petitioner, has submitted that the petitioner has not explained as to how the O.P., is not maintainable. According to her, as the parties are governed by the personal laws applicable to them, the rights and obligations arising therefrom, can be enforced in the Forums created under the Statutes alone and therefore, the Principal Family Court, Chennai is empowered to adjudicate the dispute. The second respondent has further submitted that though the petitioner has not raised the plea of ouster of jurisdiction in the counter affidavit filed in support of the Original Petition, before the Family Court, however, he has mentioned about the application of Foreign Marriages Act, 1969 and in particular Section 18(1) of the said Act. The second respondent has further submitted that the marriage was not performed before the Marriage Officer notified under the said Act and it was also not registered before him, as required under the said law and therefore, the provisions of Foreign Marriages Act will not apply to the facts of this case. As a matterR.Sridharan vs The Presiding Officer on 18 August, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114292955/ 2of fact, the Family Court itself can decide both the issues regarding jurisdiction and the merits of the case and therefore, the present Writ Petition is not maintainable. It is further submitted that once the petitioner submits himself to the jurisdiction of the Court by filing a counter statement on merits with documents in support of his case, it is not open to him to stall the proceedings, by instituting a Writ Petition before this Court and under these circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought for in the Writ Petition. 6. Referring to Section 1(2) of the Hindu Marriages Act, Ms.K.M.Nalini Shree, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that as the marriage between the parties was solemnized in Balaji Temple, Bridge Water, New Jercy, United States of America and since the petitioner is not a domicile in India, Section 1(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, which extends to the whole of India, except Jammu and Kashmir, cannot be made applicable to the Hindus, who are domiciled outside the territories to which the Act extends. She further submitted that when the second respondent herself had admitted in her counter affidavit that the petitioner is a resident of USA, supported by the passport issued by the authorities at St.Francisco., USA, the Petitioner's domicile is clearly established and therefore, she submitted that the Principal Family Court, Chennai has no jurisdiction to apply the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act or Family Courts Act to adjudicate upon the dispute between the parties. According to her, domicile of a person is a place, in which, habitation is fixed without any personal intention of removing therefrom. In support of her contention, she relied on a decision of the Supreme Court in Central Bank of India Ltd., v. Ram Narain reported in AIR 1995 SC 36. 7. Placing reliance on a decision of the Calcutta High Court in Gour Gopal Roy v. Sipra Roy reported in AIR 1978 Cal. 163, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that Section 1(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, extends to the whole of India, except Jammu and Kashmir, to all persons to whom the Act applies, should be within the territory and it excludes those who are domiciled outside the territorial jurisdiction, to which, the provisions of the Act applies. According to her, the provisions of the Foreign Marriage Act alone would apply to the facts of the present case and in view of the Foreign Marriages Act, the question of applying Private International Law does not arise. 8. Placing reliance on a decision in Chandrika v. Bhaiyalal reported in AIR 1973 SC 2391, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that though the petitioner has filed his counter statement and contested the matter before the Family Court, Chennai, it is always open to him to raise the question of territorial jurisdiction at any stage. As the Family Court lacks jurisdiction, the petitioner has prayed for a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the Family Court from proceeding with the trial in O.P.No.56 of 2004. 9. Per contra, Mr.K.Kannan, learned counsel for the second respondent has submitted that the marriage was solemnized according to Hindu Marriage Act and therefore the provisions of the Act are applicable to the parties to the marriage. He further submitted that the petitioner had himself submitted to the jurisdiction of the Family Court and agreed for the trial ""in Camera"" in a collateral proceedings in C.R.P.(PD)No.1695 of 2004 and therefore, it is not open to the petitioner to raise the plea of jurisdiction in this Writ Petition. According to him, both the parties to the marriage were originally domiciled in the territory to which the Act extends and therefore, the MatrimonialR.Sridharan vs The Presiding Officer on 18 August, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114292955/ 3","['1', '19', '18']"
296,"Kerala High Court Ayyappan Kurup Krishna Pillai vs Parukutty Amma Subhadra Amma on 25 November, 1969 Equivalent citations: AIR 1971 Ker 44 Author: R Nayar Bench: P R Nayar, P G Nair, K Mathew JUDGMENT Raman Nayar, C.J. 1. This case has come up before us because the division bench that heard it in the first instance thought that the decision of a full bench of this Court in Vasappan v. Sarada. 1957 Ker LT 977 = (AIR 1958 Ker 39 (FB)) and that of a division bench in Raghavan Indira v. Kesavan Gopinathan, 1968 Ker LT 528 required reconsideration in the light of the decision of a single iudge in Vijayamma v. Gangadharan, 1967 Ker LT 115. But, with great respect, I have no doubt whatsoever that 1957 Ker LT 977 = (AIR 1958 Ker 39) (FB) and 1968 Ker LT 528 which held that legal proceedings for the dissolution of a Hindu marriage under a special enactment could be taken in the forum named in that enactment, notwithstanding the passing of the Hindu Marriage Act, were rightly decided, and, with equally great respect I think that 1967 Ker LT 115 which held that in view of Section 19 read with Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act such proceedings could be taken only in the District Court, the saving in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 applying only to the substantive right to a dissolution, was wrongly decided. Indeed 1968 Ker LT 528 expressly states so. 2. What Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Hindu Marriage Act expressly saves from the provisions of that Act, including the overriding provision in Section 4, is ""any right recognized by custom or conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu Marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act"". It is important to note that what is saved is the right to obtain the dissolution (the emphasis is mine) -- not the right of dissolution or the grounds for dissolution, and, having regard to the plain language of the statute, as to its purpose, the right saved includes everything necessary, call it substantive, remedial or procedural, to obtain the dissolution. The right prosecuted in this particular case is the right in the Travancore Nayar Act, Sections 4 and 5, by which a marriage may be dissolved by a formal order of dissolution obtained on a petition presented by either spouse in the court of the Munsiff having jurisdiction -- the dissolution can be on one or the other of the grounds specified in Section 5. It seems to me abundantly clear that this right to obtain a dissolution on a petition presented in the court of the Munsiff having jurisdiction, on the grounds specified in Section 5, remains unaffected by any of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act by reason of the saving in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of that Act, and that the principal contention of the appellant husband in this appeal brought under Section 7 of the Travoncore Nayar Act against an order of dissolution made by a Munsiff, namely, that the Munsiff had no iurisdiction to entertain the proceeding, must fail. In this view, I think it unnecessary to embark on a consideration of the question whether the specification of a particular forum confers a substantive or a procedural or a remedial right. As I have already observed, all manner of rights, call them substantive, procedural, remedial, or what you will, -- the word ""right"" is wide enough to take in all of them -- are comprehended by the saving so long as they relate to the obtaining of the dissolution.Ayyappan Kurup Krishna Pillai vs Parukutty Amma Subhadra Amma on 25 November, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/648980/ 13. As I have already indicated, to place the other construction on the saving in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a construction which in my view is an unwarranted restriction on the plain language of that provision, a restriction to the effect that the word ""right"" is there used only in the sense of the substantive right to a dissolution, would be to defeat the very purpose of the sub-section. The subsection is only a saving of certain provisions of certain enactments other than the Hindu Marriage Act, and by no stretch of imagination can it be said that its effect is to incorporate the saved provisions in the Hindu Marriage Act. That being so, if the word, ""right"" in the subsection is to be read as meaning substantive right, the person for whose benefit the right is saved would be left without a remedy. If Section 5 of the Travancore Nayar Act which confers the right to present a petition for dissolution in the Court of the Munsiff is not saved, then there would be no means by which the person for whose benefit Parliament has gone to all the trouble of enacting the saving could enforce his right. He cannot present his petition for dissolution to the District Court, the forum specified in Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, since that section confers jurisdiction on the District Court only in respect of petitions under that Act, and as I have already said, by no stretch of imagination can it be said that a petition for dissolution under the provisions of the Travancore Nayar Act is a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act. 4. It is said that Sub-section (3) of Section 29 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides for the continuance and determination of certain classes of pending proceedings, including proceedings for dissolution of marriage, as if that Act had not been passed, implies that, after the passing of that Act, proceedings for dissolution can be instituted, and proceedings so instituted determined, only under the provisions of that Act --something that would make Sub-section (2) of the section nugatory. It is added that, at any rate, Sub-section (3) implies that the saving in Sub-section (2) does not extend to legal proceedings for dissolution; else there were no need to include pending proceedings for dissolution within the scone of the saving in Sub-section (3). Assuming that to be so, I do not know what compulsion there can be to forsake the plain meaning of one provision of a statute for the implication of another; and that, mind you, not for furthering but for defeating the purpose of the provision. But, in fact, I do not think that Sub-section (3) carries any such implication. It only plays in relation to the overriding provision in Section 4 the role played by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in relation to a repeal in so far as certain kinds of proceedings pending at the commencement of the Act are concerned, and saves such a proceeding from the overriding effect Section 4 might have over the law under which the proceeding was brought. Such a proceeding can be continued and determined under the law under which it was brought as if the Hindu Marriage Act had not been passed -- Section 6 of the General Clauses Act it will be remembered does not in terms apply to an overridden enactment. It might be that to some extent pending proceedings for dissolution come within the saving in both Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (3), but this overlapping cannot mean that the saving in Sub-section (2) does not apply to the right to take legal proceedings, for obtaining a dissolution. 5. The only other matter for decision is the plea of res judicata taken by the appellant husband. As we have seen, this appeal is against an order of dissolution made by a Munsiff on a petition presented by the wife under Section 5 of the Travancore Nayar Act. Before that, the husband had obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights on a petition presented to the District Court under Sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act.    Sub-section (2) of that section lays down that,   ""Nothing shall be pleaded in answer to a petition for restitution of conjugal rights which shall not be a ground for judicial separation or for nullity of marriage or for divorce."" Ayyappan Kurup Krishna Pillai vs Parukutty Amma Subhadra Amma on 25 November, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/648980/ 2It is said on behalf of the husband that the decree for restitution passed by the District Court is res judicata with regard to the grounds urged by the wife before the Munsiff's Court in support of her petition for dissolution. That cannot be so. For, the grounds on which the Munsiff has granted the order of dissolution are habitual cruelty and incompatibility of temperament. Even if you assume that the habitual cruelty of Section 5 of the Travancore Nayar Act has the same content as the cruelty of Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, incompatibility of temperament is not a ground under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act either for judicial separation or for nullity of marriage or for divorce. Therefore, the decree for restoration of conjugal rights passed by the District Court involves no decision on the question of incompatibility of temperament, a matter which was not and could not have been in issue before that court. There is also the circumstance, that, for the purposes of a petition under Section 5 of the Travancore Nayar Act, the Munsiff's Court is a court of exclusive jurisdiction; the District Court has no jurisdiction whatsoever. That being so, I do not think that the decision of the District Court can be res judicata in a matter where the Munsiffs Court has exclusive jurisdiction and the District Court has none, although, ordinarily, the latter is no doubt a superior court. I see no substance whatsoever in the plea of res judicata. 6. Having regard to the very limited scope of an appeal under Section 7(4) of the Travancore Nayar Act, the appellant has, very properly raised no other contention. 7. I dismiss the appeal with costs. Govindan Nair, J. 8. I agree. Mathew, J. 9. A Division Bench doubting the correctness of the decision of the Full Bench in 1957 Ker LT 977 = (AIR 1958 Ker 39 (FB)) and the Bench decision following it in 1968 Ker LT 528 has referred the appeal for decision to a Full Bench, and that is how the matter has come up before us. 10, These decisions hold that even after the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (hereinafter called the Act), the forum for filing an application for dissolution of a Hindu Marriage on the grounds mentioned in the Travancore Nayar Act, 1100 (for short, the Nayar Act) is the Munsiff's Court. The correctness of these decisions depends upon the answer to the question whether the words ""any right recognised by custom or conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of a Hindu marriage"" occurring in Section 29(2) of the Act would take in the forum provided by the Nayar Act for filing an application for dissolution of a Hindu marriage. 11. It is not disputed that the provisions in the Nayar Act relating to the dissolution of marriage ceased to have effect by virtue of Section 4(b) of the Act. Section 4(b) reads: ""Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,--Ayyappan Kurup Krishna Pillai vs Parukutty Amma Subhadra Amma on 25 November, 1969 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/648980/ 3","['6', '4', '10', '19', '5', '9', '29', '7']"

Under Section 28 of the Act, the appeal is to be regulated by the law for the time being in force. Respondent's counsel has contended that under the procedural law in force, an appeal against the decree passed by a Subordinate Judge in a lis valued up to Rs. 5,000/- lies to the District Judge and relies on the provisions of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act of 1887. Sub-section (1) of Section 21 of that Act provides:-- ""Save as aforesaid, an appeal from a decree or order of a Subordinate Judge shall lie-- (a) to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in any proceeding arising out of which the decree or order was made did not exceed five thousand rupees, and (b) to the High Court in any other case."" The present appeal having been valued at Rs. 100/-, it is contended by the respondent that the forum of appeal is the court of the District Judge and not this Court. 5. A Bench of this Court in the case of Rama Kumari Meher v. Meenaketan Meher, AIR 1976 Orissa 32, while deal-ins with a reference made by the Taxing Officer regarding sufficiency of court-fee on the memorandum of appeal, in para. 22 of the judgment indicated:-- ""We would sum up our conclusions thus:-- (i) ... ... ... ... (ii) Proceedings under Sections 9 to 13 of the Act are suits. (iii) ... ... ... (iv) Against decrees arising out of petitions under Sections 9 to 13 of the Act, first appeals are to be filed. (v) Against orders arising out of such proceedings, miscellaneous appeals He."" Mr. Patra for the appellant places reliance on the observation in Item (iv) wherein it has been stated that a first appeal is maintainable against the decree in a proceeding under Section 9 of the Act andNrusingh Charan Nayak vs Smt. Hemant Kumari Nayak on 6 February, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/279004/ 2draws support for his conclusion from the fact that a first appeal being First Appeal No. 161 of 1973 was entertained in this Court. As we have already noticed, the dispute before the Court was as to what would be the appropriate court-lee payable on the memorandum of appeal and there was no dispute with reference to the forum. It is true that it has been indicated that a first appeal lies against the decree in a proceeding under Section 9 of the Act, but as the question was not examined, the observation must be taken to be obiter. It was pointed out by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern, 1901 AC 495 :-- ""... ... ... every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but are governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found ... ... ... a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all... ... ..."" This position has been approved by the Supreme Court on more than one occasion. We, therefore, feel that unaffected by the observation in the reported decision of this Court (AIR 1976 Orissa 32), the question posed should now be examined. 6. This question came up for consideration before Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Paras Ram V. Janki Bai, AIR 1961 All 395. Delivering the decision of the Full Bench, Desai, Ag. C. J, observed (at p. 396):-- ""A proceeding under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to be treated as an original suit. Consequently an appeal from an order of a civil judge passed in such a proceeding lies to the District Judge if a certain condition is fulfilled and to the High Court if it is not. The residuary power is thus vested in the High Court and an appeal lies to the District Judge only if the condition is fulfilled. The value placed on the memorandum of appeal is of no consequence. Every plaint must bear the value of the subject-matter of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction and of court-fees (vide Order 7, Rule 1 (i) C. P. C.). A proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act is governed by the C. P. C. (vide Section 21) and Rule 5 of the Rules made by this Court in exercise of the powers conferred under Sections 14 and 21 of the Act. Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act lays down that the value for jurisdiction will be the same as that for the court-fees in suits (other than those referred to in the Court-fees Act Section 7(v), (vi) and (ix),) in which ad valorem court-fee is payable. Under Article 21-A of the Court-fees Act a fixed court-fee of Rs. 37.50 is payable on a petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act; in other words the court-fee on such a petition is not ad valorem court-fee and consequently Section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act is not applicable to the present case.Nrusingh Charan Nayak vs Smt.

This appeal arises out of a suit for maintenance filed by the appellant Suhas alias Ambadas against the respondent Manohar on the allegation that he is the son of the respondent Manohar and is entitled to be maintained by him. According to the plaintiff-appellant he was born on 30th October 1955. The suit has been filed on the 6th of January 1959. In this suit the plaintiff claimed a declaration that he is entitled to maintenance and claimed a decree for maintenance at Rs. 250/- per month or such other amount as the Court may fix from the date of suit and claimed a declaration of charge on the property described in Schedule A of the plaint or sufficient part thereof for payment of such maintenance. This plaintiff alleged that his mother Taramati who is now dead was married to the defendant on 30th January 1955 and during the lawful wedlock he was born to them on 30th October 1955. According to the plaintiff, the defendant who is his father is in law under personal obligation to maintain the plaintiff who is his minor son. IN order to claim this relief the plaintiff stated some additional facts which arose out of a prior proceeding between the defendant-respondent and the plaintiff-appellant's mother Taramati. The plaintiff's mother Taramati had earlier filed Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957 in the Court of the Third Additional District Judge, Akola, for restitution of conjugal rights. It was her contention in that suit that she was married to the respondent Manohar on the 30th of January 1955 and during the lawful wed-lock she had given birth to a son from the defendant on the 30th of October 1955. Thereafter the defendant without any reasonable cause withdrew from her society and she, therefore, claimed restitution of conjugal rights against the respondent Manohar. This suit was decided on the 1st of October 1957 by the Third Additional District Judge, Akola in favour of the plaintiff's mother Taramati and her claim for restitution of conjugal rights was decreed. Against this judgment and decree, the present respondent had filed an appeal being First Appeal No. 6 of 1958, in this Court. However, during the pendency of this appeal, the plaintiff's mother Taramati died on 2nd of August 1958. The present respondent then stated in the fist appeal that by reason of the death of Taramati, the appeal had abated and he got the appeal pending in the High Court dismissed on 6th October 1958. The plaintiff contends that the decision in Civil Suit No. 32-A 1957 has become final on the question of validity of the marriage between Taramati of validity of the marriage between Taramati and the respondent and the respondent could not escape the liability of maintaining the plaintiff who was and is a minor. 2. The defendant-respondent while resisting the suit of the present plaintiff denied the fact of marriage between the plaintiff's mother Taramati and himself either on 30th of January 1955 as alleged or at any time. He also denied that the plaintiff was born during the alleged lawful wed-lock on the 30th of October 1955. The fact, however, of the suit having been filed by Taramati against him under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act being Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957 and a decree having been passed in that proceeding has been admitted by the defendant. He also admitted that he had filed First Appeal No. 6 of 1958 in this High Court, but since Taramati had died pending theSuhas Manohar Pande vs Manohar Shamrao Pande on 27 July, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768313/ 1appeal and no cause of action survived, the appeal was dismissed on the statement of his counsel. The defendant further contended that on account of the death of Taramati that decree as to restitution of conjugal right was rendered ineffective as it was purely a decree for personal rights. According to the defendant, the decision of the trial Court in Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957 was not a final decision and on account of the death of Taramati, the said decree was rendered unexecutable and infructuous. 3. The learned trial Judge framed issues in the case and tried issues Nos. 1(a), 3(a) and (b) as preliminary issues. The three issues which were tried as preliminary issues were these: 1(a): Whether the decision in Tr. Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957 on the file of the Third Additional District Judge, Akola, is final and operates as res judicata between the parties in the present suit? 3(a): Whether the plaintiff's failure to continue the proceedings under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act amount to waiver of his right to obtain maintenance? (b) Whether the dismissal of the proceedings under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act in Tr. Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957 on the file of the Second Additional District Judge, Akola, operates as res judicata in this case? 4. The learned trial Judge answered all the three issues in the negative and ordered that the trial of the suit will proceed on rest of the issues. These findings having been given on the preliminary issues, the trial further proceeded for determining the question whether the plaintiff's mother Taramati was married to be defendant or not and whether the plaintiff was born to the deceased Taramati and the defendant during a lawful wed-lock. These issues are 1(b) and 1(c). Several witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiff as well as on behalf of the defendant and on the appreciation of that evidence the learned Judge came to the conclusion that the plaintiff's mother Taramati was not married to the defendant on 30th January 1955 and as such, the question about the plaintiff being born during the lawful wed-lock of Taramati and the defendant did not arise. On these findings, the learned Judge further held that the question as to the liability of the defendant to maintain, the plaintiff and the quantum of maintenance did not survive. The learned Judge, therefore, dismissed the suit of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has challenged the judgment and decree by this appeal. 5. Mr. Palshikar, the learned counsel for the appellant, urged before us that the findings given by the lower Court on the preliminary issues were illegal and should have been decided in favour of the plaintiff. If so decided, the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for maintenance against the defendant and it was not necessary in this suit to go over again into the question whether Taramati was the legally married wife of the defendant as the decision in the former suit, namely, Civil Suit No. 32-A of 1957, was final and binding and that could not be challenged by the present respondent. We have, therefore, heard Mr. Palshikar only on this aspect of this case without going into the evidence on the merits of the question regarding the factum of marriage between the deceased Taramati and the defendant raised again in this suit. On hearing Mr. Palsikar, we find that the matter can be decided on the basis o the preliminary issues except of course, regarding the quantum of the maintenance toSuhas Manohar Pande vs Manohar Shamrao Pande on 27 July, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768313/ 2be allowed in which question the lower Court did not enter and it is not necessary to go into the voluminous evidence adduced in this case regarding the factum of marriage between the deceased Taramati and the defendant Manohar. 6. It has been now an admitted position that there were proceedings between the deceased Taramati and the respondent Manohar under Section 9(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act in which Taramati claimed against Manohar restitution of conjugal rights on the allegation that she was married wife of the respondent Manohar and the respondent had withdrawn from her society without any reasonable excuse and as such she was entitled to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights against the respondent Manohar. In this suit the present respondent denied that he had any connections whatsoever with Taramati. He denied to have married on 30th January 1955. In fact he denied any marriage at all with Taramati. He also denied that the present appellant was a child begotten of his union with deceased Taramati. He, therefore, denied the claim of deceased Taramati for restitution of conjugal rights. The Court of the third Additional District Judge, Akola, who had the jurisdiction to try this case under the Hindu Marriage Act framed the followed issues: Issue No. 1: Whether the petitioner is a legally and validily married wife of the respondent and whether the marriage was or was not solemnised on 30-1-1955? Finding: Yes, Yes, it was. Additional Issues 2: Should the petitioner be granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights? F. Yes. In that case also evidence was adduced on behalf of either party and on the basis of the evidence adduced in that case which more or less consisted of the same witnesses who have been examined in the present case, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that there was abundant and clear evidence to prove that the marriage between the petitioner-Taramati and the respondent was duly performed on 30th January 1955. He observed that the version put forth on behalf of the respondent that there was no marriage and there was only proposals regarding the marriage in September 1955 was improbable and was also not consistent with the probabilities of the case. He, therefore, gave a finding that Taramati and the respondent Manohar were legally married on 30th of January 1955 and as a consequence of that finding, decree the claim of Taramati for restitution of conjugal rights. 7. The learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Akola, who tried the present suit, relying upon the decision of the Rangoon High Court in Ma Po Khin v. Ma Shin, (ILR 11 Rang 198), which is also reported as AIR 1933 Rang 250, observed that a suit for restitution of conjugal rights between Taramati and Manohar was purely a private suit between two private persons and no-one else had any rights to intervene in the matter and a judgment in such a suit could not be treated as the judgment in rem. The second ground given by the learned Judge was that the decree of the trial Court being one of personal nature there was nothing left for the defendant to take advantage of it and that no attempt was made by the plaintiff either to be brought on record or to set aside the dismissal of the appeal. The third ground was that the defendant had filed an appeal against theSuhas Manohar Pande vs Manohar Shamrao Pande on 27 July, 1970 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1768313/ 3","['9', '26']"

On April, 1976 the appellant husband had filed a petition in the Court of the learned District Judge, Alipore under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for a decree for judicial separation on the ground that the respondent wife had treated him with cruelty and that she had deserted him. After the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 was enacted, the appellant husband applied in the trial court for amendment of his petition, inter alia, by substituting in place of the prayer for judicial separation a prayer for decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The trial court had allowed the said prayer for amendment. The respondent wife had contested the said suit, inter alia, denying the allegations of cruelty and desertion made by her husband. 2. The learned Additional District Judge, 7th Court, Alipore dismissed the said suit. Thereafter, the plaintiff husband has filed the present appeal. 3. On 10th April, 1981 the appellant petitioner filed an application in this Court praying that he may be permitted to amend his original petition for divorce by inserting para 14 (a). The respondent wife has opposed the appellant's prayer for amendment of the petition. 4. Mr. Ranjit Kumar Banerjee, learned advocate for the appellant, has made three fold submissions before us. His first submission is, that, for determining and the real questions in controversy between the parties, the appellant, even, at this appellate stage, ought to be allowed to amend his petition. According to Mr. Banerjee, such amendment of the petition if allowed is not likely to cause any prejudice to the respondent wife and she might be sufficiently compensated by awarding costs in her favour. Alternatively, Mr. Banerjee has submitted that in the event this court is unwilling to allow the aforesaid application for amendment of the appellant's petition for divorce, the appellant may be permitted to withdraw his said petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Lastly, Mr. Banerjee has submitted that in his judgment under appeal the learned Additional District Judge has not recorded necessary findings for determining the issues framed in the case. 5. Before we consider whether at this stage the appellant husband ought to be allowed to amend his petition under Sec. 13, we may proceed to set out the questions which were in controversy between them in the trial court. As previously stated, the plaintiff husband had originally prayed for a decree for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty and desertion and subsequently his said petition was altered into one under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The plaintiff husband in his said petition had stated that on 17th Feb., 1973 the marriage between him and the respondent was solemnised according to Hindu rites. His case was that in spite of her protest only once on 17th of- March, 1973 he had cohabited with her. According to the appellant, she had conceived. The appellant further stated that from the day of the Boubhat he had realised that the respondent wasSankar Prosad Paul Chowdhury vs Madhabi Paul Chowdhury on 27 April, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109513/ 1mentally irritant by nature and was suffering from complexes. The appellant further stated that in early part of May, 1973 the respondent had undergone abortion on the medical advice of her cousin, Dr. Sudhamoy Seth of Chandarnagar. The appellant also alleged that he had become a victim of physical cruelty and violence as the respondent often inflicted blows and slaps on him. She had also threatened to commit suicide. On 20th May, 1975 he had desired to have sexual intercourse but she had rejected his advances and had begun to shout. She had also inflicted blows on him in the presence of the members of his family. She had allegedly expressed her desire to go to her parents' house. On 23rd June, 1975 the respondent had again picked up quarrel with him, and on 24th June, 1975 she went away to her parents' house with all her ornaments and articles. At the trial the petitioner husband deposed in order to prove his aforesaid allegations against his wife, the respondent herein. He also examined his sister as PW 2, who in her cross-examination denied that she had ever suggested to the respondent to get herself examined by a gynaecologist or that the respondent had shown her a medical certificate that she was physically fit. 6. The learned Additional District Judge found that admittedly the respondent went to Chandarnagar on 24th June, 1975 and since then had been residing there. On 8th April, 1976 the appellant filed the present case. Therefore, undisputedly the petitioner neither averred nor proved that the respondent wife had deserted him for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of his petition. In fact, the learned advocate for the appellant did not urge before us the said ground of desertion by the respondent wife. The learned Additional District Judge in his judgment has recorded that the petitioner husband had alleged cruelty on the part of the respondent wife on the following three grounds : (a) abusing and beating the husband, (b) her refusal to have sexual intercourse, and (c) carrying out abortion. In our view, the learned Additional District Judge rightly refused to believe that the plaintiff husband had failed to satisfactorily prove his said allegations of cruelty against his wife. Although he had averred in his petition that the respondent wife had inflicted fist blows on him in the presence of the members of his family and that she did not live with him in the same room in spite of the request of the members of the petitioner's family, the petitioner husband did not examine any member of his family to corroborate the said allegations. The court ought to draw an adverse presumption against the petitioner husband for such non-examination of the members of his family who were described as witnesses to said alleged acts of cruelty and insult by his wife. On the other, hand, even after 24th of June, 1975 when the petitioner was no longer residing, in the petitioner's house, Kunjaswar Paul Chowdhury, father of the petitioner, had written a post-card dated 1st July, 1975 (Ext. 1A) to Gopinath Seth, the father of the respondent. The father of the petitioner had expressed his sorrow for departure of Bouma (the respondent) and stated that especially his wife (the mother of the petitioner) was very anxious. Kunjaswar Babu had further written that they were praying to God for giving happiness and peace to Bouma (the respondent) and also that good sense may prevail upon Sankar (the petitioner). Kunjaswar Babu in the post-script had acknowledged receipt of a letter from the respondent and had promised to write to her. The very contents of the said post-card written by Kunjaswar Paul Chowdhury (Exts. 1A) would disprove the allegation of the petitioner that after abusing and beating him on 24th June, 1975 she had left saying that she would never return. There is also no evidence that the petitioner in fact had tried to bring her back as claimed by him. On the other hand, copies of the two letters written by her to her father-in-law (i.e. the father of the petitioner) (Exts. A2 and A3) indicated that she was very keen to return to her father-in-law's place.Sankar Prosad Paul Chowdhury vs Madhabi Paul Chowdhury on 27 April, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109513/ 2She begged forgiveness and requested that arrangements may be made to take her back. We refuse to believe the evidence of the petitioner that in fact originals of these letters were not sent under registered post. Kunjaswar Babu, the father of the petitioner, has not come forward to deny the receipt of the said two letters or to corroborate other allegations of his soft. 7. We also agree with the learned Additional District Judge that the petitioner has failed to prove that after the respondent had conceived she had voluntary abortion. No reason was suggested by the petitioner why the respondent would desire to have abortion. Same was most unnatural and improbable. There was no reliable evidence that the respondent had at all conceived or that she had abortion. 8. Mr. Banerjee, learned advocate for the appellant correctly submitted that 'cruelty' within the meaning of Clause (i) (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not confined to causing physical acts of cruelty but included mental cruelty. Persistent failure or inability on the part of a spouse to effectuate sexual intercourse without any reasonable cause may amount to cruelty. But the appellant husband has failed to prove by cogent evidence that there was such refusal or inability on the part of the respondent to have intercourse with him. We have already pointed out that the petitioner husband himself alleged that immediately after the marriage, once he had intercourse with his wife. His case was that thereafter she had persistently refused to have further intercourse with him. On 17th Feb., 1973 the marriage of the petitioner and the respondent took place. It is not believable that after 17th of March, 1973 the respondent started sleeping in a separate bed. None amongst the members of the petitioner husband's family came to corroborate the said allegations of the petitioner. Although in June, 1973 the petitioner and the respondent had visited Nainital and used to sleep in the same room, it is utterly improbable that they did not have any intercourse. We have already stated that there is also no corroboration of the petitioner's case regarding the incidents which happened before the respondent went away to her father's house on 24th June, 1975. There is much more probability in the case of the respondent that on 24th June, 1975 she did not go back alone to her father's house at Chandarnagore but she was escorted either by the petitioner or some other member of his family. We have already pointed out that the father of the petitioner in his post-card (Ext. Al) addressed to the respondent wife did not make any accusation against the respondent. On the other hand, he had expressed sorrow for leaving of his Bouma (the respondent). The trial Court has rightly found that the petitioner has failed to prove that the respondent wife had all along refused to have sexual intercourse with him. Accordingly, we hold that the court below rightly answered the issues framed by it in favour of the respondent and had correctly dismissed the appellant's petition under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 9. In our view, the appellant husband has not made out any case for allowing him to belatedly amend his pctilion by inserting therein allegations of physical deformity or defect of sexual organs of the respondent wife. All proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 are regulated as far as may be by the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (vide Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act). It is true that the Court under Order 6, Rule 17 of the Code has a wide discretion to grant, amendments of pleadings in order to do complete justice between the parties and also to shorten the course of litigation. Such discretion of the court under Order 6, Rule 17 is judicially exercised.

This matter has come before us in the following circumstances. One Antalal Gope alias Antilal Gope filed an application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for a decree of divorce against Sarbo Gopain and impleaded another person as a co-respondent on the allegation that he had committed adultery with respondent No. 1, the applicant's wife. In that application, he had also asked for a damage of Rs. 500/- against respondent No. 2. His application failed so far as both the reliefs were concerned, and he has preferred an appeal to this Court, which has been numbered as First Appeal No. 228 of 1961. 2. The Stamp Reporter of this Court pointed out that, on the memorandum of appeal, the appellant was to pay a court-fee of Rs. 22.50 under Article 17 (vi) of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act so far as the relief of divorce was concerned. He was also of the view that the same court-fee was payable on the original application. Further, he pointed out that there was a claim for damages in the original application as well as in the present appeal, and so it was a matter for consideration whether any additional court-fee was payable for that. The whole case came before Sahai, J., as the Taxing Judge, after the Taxing Officer of this Court had expressed his own opinion on the stamp-report His Lordship has referred this matter to a Division Bench for determination ct the questions involved. On the question whether a fixed court-fee of Rs. 22.50 was payable on the memorandum of appeal, His Lordship considered some of the decisions of this Court as well as some other High Court in that connection, and he seems to have differed from the view taken in Srikant Chand v. Ram Mohini AIR 1959 Pat 186. 3. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Act No. 23 of 1955), provides under Section 13 as follows : ""(1) any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party--(i) is living in adultery : etc"". Section 28 of the Act provides that- ""All decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decree and orders of the court made in the exercise of the original civil jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force; Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of costs only"". The question for consideration, is whether ""a decree of divorce"" contemplated under Section 13 will be treated as a ""decree"", as defined in Section 2 (2) of the Code ; of Civil Procedure, and, if that is so,Antala Gope Alias Antilal Gope vs Smt. Sarbo Gopain And Anr. on 27 April, 1962 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120511/ 1then the appeal preferred against that will have to be treated as an appeal from an original decree. In some other sections of the Act, the word ""decree"" has also been mentioned, such as, ""a decree for judicial separation"" in Section 10. Section 28, however, refers not only to ""decrees"" under the Act but also to orders passed by the Court in any proceeding under the Act. If the word ""a decree for divorce"" or ""a decree for judicial separation"" was used in the Act in the sense of a ""decree"", as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, then there was no necessity to provide in Section 28 to the effect that such decrees : ""shall be enforced in like manner as the decree . . . of the court made in the exercise of the original civil jurisdiction are enforced"". The inclusion of these words clearly indicates that the Legislature did not use the word ""decree"" in Section 13 or any other Section in the same sense as the word has been defined in the Code of Civil Procedure. To us, it appears that the word has been used in its dictionary sense that is to say, in the sense of a decision or an edict.  4. The     Act     provides     under     Section      21   that:     ""all   proceedings   under   this   Act   shall   be   regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil of Procedure,  1908"";  that is to say, the procedure to be adopted by the Court, in dealing with such proceedings, will be akin to that provided for the trial of suits in a Civil Court. But that does not make the proceeding a suit or the application a plaint. We may refer to some other statutes by way of analogy. The Provincial Insolvency Act provides for appeal by persons aggrieved by a decision or an order made in the exercise of insolvency jurisdiction by a court to a District Court. That Act also enjoins that the Code of Civil Procedure will be followed as far as possible in the proceedings under that Act. The insolvency petition is required to be in writing, signed and verified in manner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure (Section 12). In spite of these provisions, an appeal, if it is taken against the decision of the insolvency court, either to the District Court or to the High Court, is not treated as an appeal from an original decree, and, in no event, any court-fee other than that levied on a miscellaneous appeal is called for, Similarly, an appeal preferred under the Guardians and Wards Act, is treated as a miscellaneous appeal, although, under Section 10 of that Act, every application is required to be signed and verified in the manner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure for signing and verification of a plaint. Section 47 of that Act provides for appeal to the High Court from an order made by the subordinate court under that Act. In the Hindu Marriage Act, it is also provided under Section 20 (2) that-   ""The  statements     contained     in  every  petition  under this Act shall be verified by the petitioner or some other competent person in the manner required by law for the verification of plaints, and may, at the hearing, be referred to as evidence"".    This  provision  does  not  refer  in  terms  to  the  Code  of Civil Procedure as far as the verification of plaints is concerned; but that is, undoubtedly, meant by the section. Antala Gope Alias Antilal Gope vs Smt. Sarbo Gopain And Anr. on 27 April, 1962 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120511/ 2Thus, we see that the provision for making applications under Hindu Marriage Act is in no way different from that provided under the Guardians and Wards Actor the Provincial Insolvency Act. The provision for appeals is also made in all the three statutes themselves. In such circumstances, there is no reason why an appeal coming under the Hindu Marriage Act should be treated in a manner different from that adopted for the appeal under the Guardians and Wards Act or the Provincial Insolvency Act. 5. Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court-Fees Act provides for ""Memorandum of appeal when the appeal is not from a decree or an order having the force of a decree, and is presented (a) *     *     * (b) to a High Court . . . . . ."" a fixed court-fee of two rupees, which, according to the Bihar amendment, has now come to six rupees. This Court-fee is levied on all appeals coming under the Guardians and Wards Act or the Provincial insolvency. Act The words ""a decree or another order having the force of a decree"" have been interpreted in certain decisions--and it is now accepted in the sense--that an order which is executable in the same manner as a decree is not an order having the force of a decree--See Official Liquidator, Universal Bank, Ltd. (in liquidation) v. M.U. Qureshi, AIR 1945 Lah 146 (FB) and In re Venkataratnam AIR 1941 Mad 639. It appears that the words employed in Section 28 were used to indicate the difference between a decree or an order having the force of a decree and a decree or an order which is to be enforced in the like manner as a decree and an order of a Civil Court. Therefore, in our view, Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act will be applicable to all appeals coming under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In this connection, we may refer to the case of Srikant Chand AIR 1959 Pat 186 (supra). That was about the court-fee payable on an application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the original Court. Yet, the reason given in that decision in. support of the conclusions arrived at will hold good in the present case before us. Their Lordships field that such applications would bear a court-fee as provided for in Article 1 (b) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act and not as provided in Article 17 (vi) of that schedule. If such an application is to be treated not as a plaint, there is no reason why an appeal coming out of that will be treated as one arising out of a decree given by a competent Court on a plaint. A similar view was taken in the case of Karbhari Vithoba v. Aunsuya Karbhari, AIR 1958 Bom 425 about the court fee payable on a petition for divorce. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the court fee which is chargeable on a memorandum of appeal not arising out of a decree or an order having the force of decree, that is, on an appeal coming within Article 11 of Schedule 11 of the Court FeesAntala Gope Alias Antilal Gope vs Smt.

301,"Allahabad High Court Smt. Gurbachan Kaur vs Sardar Swaran Singh on 14 March, 1978 Equivalent citations: AIR 1978 All 255 Author: J Sinha Bench: J Sinha JUDGMENT J.M.L. Sinha, J. 1. This is a defendant's second appeal arising out of the judgment and decree dated 13th October, 1976 passed by the Additional District Judge, Dehra Dun. 2. The facts giving rise to this appeal can briefly be stated as under ; Smt. Gurbachan Kaur and Sardar Swaran Singh, 'hereinafter called the appellant and the respondent respectively, were married on 2nd of October, 1973. Some differences having arisen between them, the respondent filed a suit under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act for a declaration that his marriage with the appellant was null and void. It was alleged in the plaint that on 14th of October, 1973, when the appellant was found profusely bleeding from her private part, she was shown to a lady doctor and it was then discovered that the appellant was already having pregnancy with a treat of miscarriage. On being questioned the appellant confessed that she was quick with child and had taken medicine to get rid of the pre-gancy. The respondent, it is alleged, therefore sent the appellant back to her father's house, but on 25th of March, 1974, the appellant was escorted back to his house by her mother and left there. It is further alleged that when the respondent insisted upon the appellant to go back to her father's house, as she had illicit intercourse with some person before the marriage, the appellant went to bath-room and swallowed Tik-20 saving that she was ending her life. She was again taken to hospital from where she was discharged on 28th of March, 1974 and was then sent back to her father's house along with her Istridhan property. 3. The suit was resisted by the appellant. In the written statement filed by her she denied all the allegations made against her. She, however, made a counter-allegation against the respondent to the effect that the respondent had adulterous relations with his sister-in-law and that the respondent, in collusion with his sister-in-law, intentionally administered some kind of slow poison to her. It was further alleged by her that on 29th of March, 1'974 the respondent beat her, snatched away all her jewellery, clothing etc. and turned her out of the house. 4. After the aforesaid written statement had been filed by the appellant, the respondent got the plaint amended to include a plea to the effect that false charge of adultery and that of administering poison to the appellant, levelled against him in the written statement amounted to repeated and persistent cruelty against him and he was on that ground entitled to a decree of dissolution of marriage against the appellant. 4-A. The trial court on the consideration of the evidence on record held that the allegations made against the appellant about her being pregnant since before her marriage was incorrect. The trial court, however, held that the counter-allegation made by the appellant that the respondent wasSmt. Gurbachan Kaur vs Sardar Swaran Singh on 14 March, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1051389/ 1living an adulterous life with his sister-in-law and that both of them administered slow poison to her amounted to an act of cruelty. In the result, the trial court granted a decree for dissolution of marriage. 5. Aggrieved against the judgment of the trial court, Smt. Gurbachan Kaur filed an appeal in the court of the District Judge, Dehra Dun. The learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, who heard the appeal, took notice of the amendment of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act as brought about by Act 68 of 1976 and observed that, after the amendment, cruelty simpliciter was a sufficient ground for divorce and it was not necessary that such an act should be repeated or persistent. Further on the learned Additional District Judge concurred with the finding of the trial court that the allegation made by the appellant against the respondent about his having adulterous relations with his sister-in-law and about the respondent and his sister-in-law having colluded to administer poison to her amounted to acts of cruelty. The learned Additional District Judge, accordingly, confirmed the decree passed by the trial court and dismissed the appeal. 6. Feeling dissatisfied with the judgment of the lower appellate court, Smt. Gurbachan Kaur has come up in appeal before this Court. 7. Learned counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection to the effect that a second appeal is not maintainable against the orders or decrees passed in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. Learned counsel pointed out that the only provision contained in the Hindu Marriage Act in regard to appeals is that contained in Section 28 thereof which states that decrees and orders made in any proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. Learned counsel further urged that, in view of the language used in Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, it is necessary to refer to the provisions contained in the Civil P. C. in order to find the right and extent of appeal against the orders passed in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. Reference was then made to Section 100, Civil P. C., which contains provision regarding second appeals, and it was pointed out that, according to the provision contained in that section, a second appeal can lie only from a decree. Learned counsel pointed out that, according to the definition of the expression 'decree' as contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Act, it means formal expression of adjudication which conclusively determines the right of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in a' suit. It was urged by the learned counsel that a cumulative reading of Section 2(2) and Section 100, Civil P. C. leads to the conclusion that a second appeal can lie to High Court only against decrees passed in a suit. According to the learned counsel for the respondent, proceedings under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act not being a suit, the order passed in those proceedings cannot constitute a 'decree' within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the Civil P. C., and consequently, no second appeal can lie against an order passed in those proceedings. Elaborating his contention that proceedings under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, are not 'suit' learned counsel pointed out that a suit is always initiated by a plaint and, since an application under Section 13 cannot be termed to be a plaint, the proceedings starting with that application cannot be termed to be a 'suit'. 8. Having given my careful thought to the contention raised by the learned counsel for the respondent I regret my inability to accept it.Smt. Gurbachan Kaur vs Sardar Swaran Singh on 14 March, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1051389/ 29. In Yudhisthir Singh v. Batauna Devi (1962 All LJ 432) a petition for divorce was filed before a Civil Judge, who allowed the petition. An appeal against that decision was filed before the District Judge, who dismissed it and then a second appeal was filed in this court. A contention was raised in that case that the District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. While deciding that point this court said : ""Under Section 21 of the Act all proceedings under it shall be regulated by the C. P. C. as far as may be; this means that a petition under 3. 13 is to toe treated as a plaint in a suit and the law as applicable to plaints will apply to petitions under Section 13 also."" and further on: ""His right of appeal is derived solely from the provision of Section 28 of the Act and if that provision confers upon him the right of appeal to the District Judge in certain circumstances, he cannot be heard to say that he is deprived of a right to appeal to the High Court."". (Underlining is by me). In case Sarla Devi v. Balwan Singh (1968 All LJ 676) : (AIR 1969 All 601) the question for consideration was whether an appeal could He against an order passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. While considering that question this Court observed : ""In our opinion, therefore, the second part of Section 28 of the Act makes every decree or order passed under the provisions of the Act appealable as of right, but the appeal would be regulated and governed by that particular local civil Act which rules in the State in which the appeal arises."" 10. In Bai Umiyabhan v. Ambalal Laxmidas (AIR 1966 Guj 139) the question whether a second appeal can lie against an order passed in a petition for judicial separation came up directly for consideration. Their Lordships of the Gujarat High Court accepted that a decree passed in proceedings for judicial separation under the Hindu Marriage Act is not a 'decree' within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the Civil P. C. and that the right of second appeal against an appellate decree made by a court in a petition for judicial separation does not flow from Section 100 of the Civil P. C. However, after making an elaborate discussion of Section 28, Section 22 and Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act it was held by their Lordships that the words 'decrees and orders' contained in Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, according to their plain and natural sense, include not only original decrees and orders but also appellate decree and orders. The preliminary objection against the maintainability of the second appeal was, accordingly, rejected. The fact that Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act is self-contained and that it contains an independent provision conferring a right of appeal also finds support from a Division Bench decision of the High Court of Punjab. In case P. C. Jairath v. Mrs. Amrit Jairat (AIR 1967 Punj 148) it was observed (at p. 151) : ""The language of Section 28 also makes it clear that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act are not decrees under the Civil P. C., for it is stated therein that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act shall be enforced in the like manner as decrees of a court on its original civil jurisdiction. This necessarily implies that though the decrees under the Act are by a statutory fiction treated for the purposes of enforcement as decrees under the Code, they in fact are not such decrees. It was also not the intention of the Legislature in my view while giving a right oil appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, to make that right indefinite and more or less illusory by providing that the appealSmt.

JUSTICE J.R. MIDHA                                  JUDGMENT 1. The requirements of justice give an occasion for the development of new dimension of justice by evolving juristic principles for doing complete justice according to the current needs of the Society. The quest for justice in the process of administration of justice occasions the evolution of new dimensions of the justice. J.S. Verma, J., in his Article ""New Dimensions of Justice"", (1997) 3 SCC J-3 observed that:- ""...Justice is the ideal to be achieved by Law. Justice is the goal of law. Law is a set of general rules applied in the administration of justice. Justice is in a cause on application of law to a particular case. Jurisprudence is the philosophy of law. Jurisprudence and Law have ultimately to be tested on the anvil of administration of justice. 'Law as it is', may fall short of 'Law as it ought to be' for doing complete justice in a cause. The gap between the two may be described as the field covered by Morality. There is no doubt that the development of the law is influenced by morals. The infusion of morality for reshaping the law is influenced by the principles of Equity and Natural Justice, as effective agencies of growth. The ideal State is when the rules of law satisfy the requirements of justice and the gap between the two is bridged. It is this attempt to bridge the gap which occasions the development of New Jurisprudence. The existence of some gap between law and justice is recognized by the existing law itself. This is the reason for the recognition of inherent powers of the court by express provision made in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure.Kusum Sharma vs Mahinder Kumar Sharma on 14 January, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94345757/ 2The Constitution of India by Article 142 expressly confers on the Supreme Court plenary powers for doing complete justice in any cause or matter before it. Such power in the court of last resort is recognition of the principle that in the justice delivery system, at the end point attempt must be made to do complete justice in every cause, if that result cannot be achieved by provisions of the enacted law. These powers are in addition to the discretionary powers of courts in certain areas where rigidity is considered inappropriate, e.g., equitable reliefs and Article 226 of the Constitution. ..."" Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 2. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act empowers the Court to award maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his/her support in proceedings pending under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, having regard to the income of the parties. The Proviso to Section 24 provides that application under Section 24 shall be disposed of within 60 days of the date of service of notice on the opposite party. 3. Maintenance is not merely a legal right. It is part and parcel of basic human right. For weaker sections, it is a problem in the sense that their very survival rest on the maintenance. The object behind the provision is two-fold: firstly, to prevent vagrancy resulting from stained relation between the husband and wife, and secondly, to ensure that the indigent litigating spouse is not handicapped in defending or prosecuting the case due to want of money. On the breakdown of the marriage, it often so happens that the husband pays nothing for the support of his wife and children and the wife has to fall back upon her parents and relatives to fend her immediate needs. Reasonableness too demands extension of such a relief in favour of a needy spouse. Had not the parties drifted away from one another, the spouse from whom support is sought would have in any case supported the other spouse entailing financial burden. Hence, it is but natural to make the husband bear the cost of maintaining his wife pending disposal of any dispute until some permanent relief is provided to her. 4. In Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena & Ors, AIR 2014 SC 2875 the Supreme Court held that any delay in adjudication of maintenance cases by the Family Court is not only against human rights but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual. The object of the provisions for grant of maintenance is to provide speedy remedy for supply of food, clothing and shelter to the deserted wife and to prevent vagrancy and destitution. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under: ""2. The two issues that pronouncedly emanate in this appeal by special leave are whether the Family Court while deciding an application under Section 7 of the Family Court Act, 1984 (for brevity, ""the Act"") which includes determination of grant of maintenance to the persons as entitled under that provision, should allow adjournments in an extremely liberal manner remaining oblivious of objects and reasons of the Act and also keeping the windows of wisdom closed and the sense of judicial responsiveness suspended to the manifest perceptibility of vagrancy, destitution, impecuniosity, struggle for survival and the emotional fracture, a wifeKusum Sharma vs Mahinder Kumar Sharma on 14 January, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94345757/ 3","['24', '7']"

Petitioner Shri Anjan Kumar Kataki has preferred this Civil Revision against the Order dt. 7-2-83 passed by the learned Additional District Judge of Dibrugarh in Misc. Case No. 3 of 1980 arising out of Title Suit (Divorce) No. 1 of 1983 (Original No. 11 of 1978). 2. Petitioner Shri Anjan Kumar Kataki was husband of Smt. Minakshi Devi Kataki. He instituted a suit under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for obtaining decree of divorce against Smt. Minakshi Devi. He obtained an ex parte divorce decree on 31-3-79 in the Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh. 3. Smt. Minakshi Devi filed a petition under Order 9, Rule 13 C.P.C. for setting aside the said ex parte decree. The said petition was registered as Misc. Case No. 84 of 1979 in the Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh and subsequently on transfer, registered as Misc. Case No. 3 of 1980 in the Court of Additional District Judge, Dibrugarh. Shri Anjan Kumar Kataki contested the said Misc. Case on the ground that the case was not maintainable under Order 9, Rule 13, C.P.C. in view of the provisions under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act (amended in 1976). However, the Additional District Judge held that a petition under Order 9, ,R. 13, C.P.C. was maintainable and accordingly allowed the said petition, set aside the ex parte decree and restored the suit to file by his order dt. 7-2-83 in Misc. Case No. 3 of 1983. Therefore, Shri Anjan Kumar Kataki has preferred this Civil Revision against the said order. 4. The learned counsel Smt. Mira Sarma, on behalf of the petitioner submitted that only appeal lies against all the decrees including ex parte decree, and has referred Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act (Amended in 1976). She further submitted that a petition under Order 9, Rule 13 C.P.C. is not maintainable in view of the clear mandatory provision of Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. On the other hand, the learned counsel Shri B. M. Goswami for the opposite party submitted that a petition under O. 9 Rule 13 will also be maintainable in spite of the provisions under Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, because all proceedings under Hindu Marriage Act are regulated by the Civil P.C. He has referred Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Now the point for decision is, whether a petition under Order 9 Rule 13 is maintainable for setting aside an ex parte decree passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this connection both the Sections 21 and 28(1) are to be read together : Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act :-- ""Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.""Anjan Kumar Kataki vs Smt. Minakshi Sarma on 15 March, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1728456/ 1Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act :--""All decrees made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction."" 5. It is made clear that subject to the other provisions contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, all proceedings under the said Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Civil P.iC. Therefore, the mandatory provisions of Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be regulated by Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C. for setting aside an ex parte decree. All decrees made by the Court in any proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act also include an ex parte decree. Therefore, only appeal will lie against an ex parte decree as laid down under the mandatory provisions of Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. An application under Order 9, Rule 13 C.P.C., for setting aside such ex parte decree, is not maintainable. The learned Additional District Judge committed error in law. The order dt. 7-2-83 is liable to be set aside. 6. In the result, this Civil Revision is allowed and the Rule is made absolute. The impugned order dt. 7-2-83 in Misc. Case No. 3 of 1980 is set aside. The said Misc. Case No. 3 of 1980 stands dismissed for non-maintainability. Send back the records to the Court of the Additional District Judge, Dibrugarh.

304,"Allahabad High Court Smt. Preeti Archana Sharma vs Ravind Kr. Sharma on 17 October, 1978 Equivalent citations: AIR 1979 All 29 Author: A Banerji Bench: A Banerji ORDER Amitav Banerji, J. 1. This Civil Revision is directed against an order passed by the 1st Additional District Judge, Allahabad dated 30th March, 1978 on an application, made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In a suit filed by the husband for the dissolution of the marriage under Section 13 of the Act, the wife made an application for maintenance, pendente lite and expenses for legal proceedings. After considering the respective cases the court below passed an order directing the husband to pay a sum of Rs. 100/- per month as maintenance and Rs. 100/- for expenses in the legal proceedings. The wife aggrieved by the above order has come up to this Court in revision stating that the court below has committed material irregularity in exercise of jurisdiction in passing the aforesaid order. It was urged that certain materials on record have not been taken into consideration with the result that a completely erroneous order has been passed, 2. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Normally, the question as to what should be the quantum of maintenance and the amount of expense for legal proceeding is a pure question of fact to be decided upon by the trial Court. The Court trying the suit is in the best position to assess as to what should be the amount of maintenance and also estimate the amount of expense that ought to be provided to the party asking for it. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for payment of maintenance pendente lite and expenses of the proceedings. It lays down: ""Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the court to be reasonable"". 3. A number of cases were cited showing the mode and method of calculation of the quantum of maintenance allowance and the expenses for legal proceedings. Reference was also made to the provisions of Section 36 of the Divorce Act, which provides for alimony pendente lite. Under the above Act, only the wife is to be paid an alimony pendente lite not exceeding one-fifth of the husband's average net income for 3 years preceding the date of the order. The Hindu Marriage Act is silent about this. It cannot be visualised for a moment that the framers of the Act were not aware of the provisions in the Divorce Act. If they did not provide for a maximum limit in the Marriage Act, it must be presumed that this was done with an intent to leave the matter to the discretion of the Court. I am, therefore, of the opinion that neither a minimum nor a maximum amount in terms of percentage can be fixed for the maintenance allowance under the Hindu Marriage Act. The; quantum will always depend on tbe circumstances of the case. Tbe Legislature in its wisdom did not want that there should be any restriction on the Court and, therefore, no percentage of the incomeSmt. Preeti Archana Sharma vs Ravind Kr. Sharma on 17 October, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1012162/ 1was fixed. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, however, makes it clear that no amount as maintenance is to be paid either to the wife or the husband, as the case may be, where they have sufficient income for her or his support and the necessary expenses for the legal proceeding. Where, however, either of them does not have sufficient income, the Court may, have ing regard to the income of the parties, pass an order for the payment of monthly amount and the expenses for litigation as may be reasonable, It is clear from the above that if both parties have income the Court must take that into consideration before ordering the payment of any maintenance allowance or expenses for proceedings. If the applicant has the income and the opposite party does not, and the latter makes an application the Court is bound to make an order in favour of the latter and vice versa. 4. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, therefore, makes it clear that a reasonable amount has to be paid as maintenance allowance. What is reasonable amount will differ from case to case. It must be remembered that Section 24 does not stipulate anything about the standard to be maintained by either of the parties. Section 24 also does not stipulate that the wife must be maintained at the same standard as the husband or vice versa. Similarly, Section 24 does not lay down as to what should be the amount in a litigation under the Hindu Marriage Act for meeting the expenses of the proceedings. This too has also not been laid down in Section 24 of the Act, except to say that the amount shall be a reasonable one taking into consideration the income of the parties. It is, therefore, apparent that the entire discretion is left with the Court. 5. The question, therefore, arises as to how the discretion should be exercised. It is well settled that a discretion must be exercised in a reasonable and proper manner, and not arbitrarily or capriciously. An order is a reasonable order which takes into consideration the various circumstances, for example, the means and the income of the parties, the nature of the litigation and allied circumstances. Section 24 uses the word ""support"" and does not use the word ""standard"" or ""status"". It is clear that the Court must keep in view that one cannot live like a Lord and the other like a maid nor can one live like a princess and the other like a servant. There must be some balance. It cannot be that while one lives in penury the other lives in grand style. The object of Section 24 is to provide the financially weaker party with some modicum of funds so that he or she, as the case may be, may contest the litigation. Every matrimonial suit is galling to the parties. It lays bare their personal problems. Their failure to adjust becomes a matter of discussion in Court, The sanctity of the matrimonial relationship is a confidential and private affair, but the same does not remain so once the matter comes to Court. Both the parties, howsoever high they may be, have to come to Court, lead evidence and contest the suit. It means that they have to come to Court a number of times. It also means expense. It is also well known that a suit does not conclude, even if it be a matrimonial suit early. It takes time. How is the party, the weaker party to maintain himself or herself, as the case may be, during the period the proceedings are pending. Justice demands that their equities be adjusted. It is, therefore, necessary for the Court to find out the respective income of the parties and the means they have. If a party has sufficient means, the Court may not allow her litigation expenses, but where it is shown that the party does not have an income or means the Court must order payment under both the heads.Smt. Preeti Archana Sharma vs Ravind Kr. Sharma on 17 October, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1012162/ 2What should be the reasonable amount would be decided by the Court taking into consideration the various factors e.g. means the party has, the support the party is having from his or her parents and the means of the other party. Supposing a party is having an income of Rs. 1,000/- per month, the Court must also take into consideration what are the necessary expenses of that party in discharge of his duties. Such amount should be deducted before arriving at the amount which is available. Necessary expenses would mean the expenses that are connected with his service or job or business which has necessarily to be made so that the service or the job or the business may continue. It does not include any amount that has to be spent towards entertainment or the like. If a party has to pay insurance premium or provident fund or income-tax, those are necessary expenses which must be deducted from the gross income to arrive at a net income. Similarly, the party would be requiring some amount to meet his or her daily needs. Such amount must also be considered as necessary expenses. It would, therefore, be seen that probably 50 or 60 per cent of the income of a person would go towards necessary expenses. It would leave a much smaller sum available. It is that figure which should be taken into consideration for finding out as to how much of it could be spared for the other side, but at the same time the Court must keep in view the income or means or the support the other party is already having. If the Court comes to the conclusion that even if she has no income but she has the support of her parents or such others, the Court may award a nominal monthly amount towards maintenance and a sufficient sum for meeting the expenses for the legal proceedings. As seen above, these are the relative terms and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. 6. I was referred to certain decisions of the various High Courts reported in the Matrimonial Law Reporter of 1977 and 1978. In the case of Sita Ram Agrawal v. Smt. Krishna 1977 Mat LR 1, the Rajasthan High Court was considering a Misc. Appeal against the order of the District Judge, and the Court decided that the maintenance should be l/5th of the husband's income. As I have indicated there is no hard and fast rule for allowing l/5th or 1/4th or l/3rd of the income of the husband as maintenance allowance. In the case of Mrs. Sarita Mehta v. Captain Arvind Kumar Mehta (1978 Mat LR 117 (Punj)) the court was considering the meaning of the words ""During the proceedings"" under Section 24 of the Act in a Civil Revision. It was stated there ""in order to avoid starvation or destitution, monthly maintenance was provided."" It was further held that the term during the proceedings ""would cover the proceedings from the start till the end or at least from the date the application is made till the termination of proceedings in the Court,"" A reference was also made to the decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in (AIR 1974 All 110, Surendra Kumar v. Smt. Kamlesh). The Court held that the relief under Section 24 can be granted even if an objection was raised that the Court has no jurisdiction to decide the suit. It was further held in this decision that the revision application under Section 115 is also a proceeding under the Act. The Supreme Court in the case of Dr. Kulbhushan Kunwar v. Smt. Raj Kumari (AIR 1971 SC 234) was considering the question of claim for maintenance by wife and daughter under Section 23(2) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. It may be mentioned here that the aforesaid provision is far more elaborate than the provision of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 23(2) inter alia states that in determining the amount of maintenance, if any, to be awarded to a wife, children or aged or infirm parents, regard shall be had to :-- (a) the position and status of the parties;Smt.

An emotive question, whether continuance in adulterous relationship on the part of husband after the decree of judicial separation granted in favour of wife, inter alia, on the same ground, would per se amount to taking advantage of his own wrong so as to disentitle him to a decree f or divorce, arises in this. The question arises in the following circumstances: The parties hereto are Hindu and their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu rites somewhere in 1954 A. D. They stayed as husband and wife for seven years, and three children were born - one son and two daughters - by this wedlock. They had fallen out completely for reasons, the respective version of which is different, somewhere in 1961 and they are staying separately since then. It is an admitted position on the part of the respondent-husband that he developed intimacy with one Smt. Indumati, who happened to be the friend of the appellant-wife, and they came closer to each other and started living together after the appellant-wife started residing separately in the ground floor of one of the ancestral house properties. It is claimed by the respondent-husband that he made adequate arrangement for the residence and maintenance of the wife and children by purchasing a building in the said locality in the name Of the wife so that she can maintain herself and her children from the income of the said property. He also made a grievance that in spite of his looking after her and her children, she picked~ up quarrels with him and his, stepmother, who is residing in the upper portion of the ancestral property in which the appellant-wife is staying with her children with the result that their relations have embittered. It appears that the appellant-wife had filed a petition in the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, in July 1968, being Hindu Marriage Petition No. 55 of 1968, praying for a decree of restitution of conjugal rights, or, in the alternative, for judicial separation. There was no effective contest in those proceedings, with the result that on November 19, 1968, the City Civil Court granted a decree for judicial separation and directed the respondent-husband to pay Rs. 60/- as and by way of alimony for maintenance of the appellant-wife and children. Since there was no resumption of co-habitation between the parties hereto for a period of two years after the passing of the decree for judicial separation, the respondent-husband presented a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce as permitted under S. 13(1A) of the Hindu Marriage Act. This petition was resisted by the appellant-wife, inter alia, on the ground that the husband was not competent to present the petition under Section 13(1A), and, in any case, there were justifying reasons for the Court to reject the petition under Section 23(1) inasmuch as the husband is trying to take advantage of his own wrong by continuing to stay in adulterous course with Smt. Indumati and not caring for the children. The learned Judge of the City Civil Court raised necessary issues on these pleadings, and, on hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, found that they failed to co-habit for a period of two years or more after the decree for judicial separation was granted on 19th November 1968. A contention was urged on behalf of the appellant-wife that the husband was trying to take advantage of his own wrong and, therefore, decree for divorce should be refused in 'view of the provisions contained in Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. TheBai Mani vs Jayantilal Dahyabhai on 4 May, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1737926/ 1learned City Civil Judge, without addressing himself to the question, whether there were any circumstances brought out in the evidence of the parties which disentitled the husband to a decree for dissolution of marriage by divorce under Section 23(1)(a), merely followed the decision of this Court in Appeal No. 621 of 1971 rendered by M. U. Shah, J. (as he then was) on 29th August, 1972, and answered issue No. 2 in favour of the husband that he was entitled to the decree prayed for. He, therefore, granted a decree for divorce dissolving the marriage by his judgment and order of 2nd July 1973, which is the subject-matter of this first appeal before US. 2. At the time of hearing of this appeal, Mr. Patel, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellant-wife, raised the following two contentions before us: 1. The learned City Civil Judge was clearly in error in finding that the respondent-husband was entitled to a decree for divorce without addressing himself to the question which was raised before him that there were justifying reasons under Section 23(1)(a) for refusing the relief of divorce prayed for. 2. In any case, the persistent conduct on the part of the husband in continuing the adulterous relationship even after the decree for judicial separation should be treated as so reprehensible that to grant a decree for divorce at his instance would be tantamount to allowing him to take advantage of his own wrong and, therefore, the learned City Civil Judge ought to have refused to grant the decree for divorce dissolving the marriage. 3. These contentions were sought to be repelled by the learned Advocate for the respondent-husband by urging that unless the wife is able to establish that there were other circumstances or facts besides the matrimonial offence of adultery already committed on which the decree for judicial separation has already been granted, the wife cannot successfully resist the decree for divorce especially when the Legislature has specifically granted this right even to a defaulting spouse by putting sub-section (1A) of Section 13 on the statute book. In submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent-husband, no material has been placed on the record of the trial Court which discloses any new circumstances or facts besides the continuance of matrimonial offence of adultery for which the penal consequences have been already imposed by the Court by granting judicial separation to the wife. 4. This position of law is now settled beyond doubt by the decision of the Supreme Court in Dharmendra Kumar v. Usha Kumar, AIR 1977 SC 2218. 5. We do not think that it can be a matter of debate as to whether a defaulting spouse can present a petition, inter alia, for dissolution of marriage by divorce if the conditions specified in Section 13(1A) of the Hindu Marriage Act are satisfied. The conditions are that there should be no resumption of cohabitation or restitution of conjugal rights for a period of two years or upwards (at the relevant time) between the parties to the marriage after the decree for judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights, as the case may be, is granted. It should be recalled that before sub-section (1A) was amended by Act 44 of 1964 with effect from December 20, 1964, it was only the aggrieved party, which was entitled to present a petition for dissolution of marriage by praying for a decree ofBai Mani vs Jayantilal Dahyabhai on 4 May, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1737926/ 2divorce. The effect of the amended sub-section (1A) of Section 13 is that it entitles even a defaulting party and not merely an aggrieved party to obtain dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce on satisfaction of the conditions Prescribed therein. It also cannot be a bone of contention between the parties that either of the spouses is under any obligation to resume co-habitation after the decree for judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights is granted. The only pertinent question which, therefore, arises for our consideration in this appeal is, whether the continuance on the part' of the husband in adulterous course of life by staying with his mistress would amount to such a wrong as to disentitle him to a decree of divorce under Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Advocate for the appellant wife strenuously attempted to persuade us that in the present case before us where the respondent-husband, after the decree for judicial separation was granted, not only did not care for the wife or children but continued to lead the amorous way of life by persisting to reside with his mistress, and if this conduct is not considered to be reprehensible enough by the Court so as not to amount to a wrong of such a nature disentitling the husband from obtaining a decree of divorce, it would be tantamount to this Court putting its imprimatur on the illegitimate and immoral way of life. In submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant-wife, this Court must discourage such husbands, who, not only by their conduct, create situation where their lawfully wedded wives, in the interest of morality and also well being of the children and the family, are compelled to reside separately, to continue to persist in their misbehaviour so that the married life which has been put on probation during the period of two years after the decree of judicial separation is granted is completely jeopardized. In support of his contention, the learned Advocate for -the appellant-wife relied on the decision of T. U. Mehta, J. (as he then was) decided on 16th February, 1973 in First Appeal No. 481 of 1970, where the facts were almost on all fours with those of the present case before us. We must frankly admit that there is a great appeal in this contention of the learned Advocate for the appellant-wife, though we are unable to subscribe wholly to the reasoning underlying his contention. As a matter of fact it is a delicate choice between the two views since the facts of the decisions of the different High Courts on this point, except the one, which was before T. U. Mehta J., are not similar with the facts with which we are concerned in this case. It cannot be gainsaid that, in the present case the marriage between the parties has foundered and they have reached to a point of no return. It was 17 years back that they have fallen out for the reasons, which may be appearing valid to both the sides from their particular angle in life. The husband found the wife nagging and quarrelsome in temperament and lacking in intellectual pursuits of life since she had no formal education. On the other hand, for no fault of her, the wife found it impossible in her own self-respect and in the interest of the moral values of life and the well being of the three young children -to continue to reside with her husband in the insulting position in which she was landed. In this long period of 17 years, the husband was committed gradually to the mistress whom he had taken up with him and the wife found it humiliating to return to her husband's place. Another important fact to which we must refer to is that three children have born through the relationship of the husband with the mistress outside marriage and they are also now, by this time, grown up demanding attention and assistance of the unfortunate ' husband. It is in this backdrop of human tragedy, which has engulfed this family that we have to make our delicate preference for either of the views. Can we agree with the view forcefully presented before us by Mr. Patel, learned Advocate for the appellant-wife that volition of the husband to continue to reside with the mistress whom he had accepted 17 years before and through whom three children have been born which can be justifiably presented as persistent immoral and wrongful conduct on the part ofBai Mani vs Jayantilal Dahyabhai on 4 May, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1737926/ 3","['13', '23']"

On 22-5-56 the appellant in both these appeals was wedded to the respondent. They are Bramhins by caste, and their marriage was a sacramental one. The marriage did not run smoothly for long, and entered into a troubled phase. At the time of this marriage, the husband was a student in the college. At his village home, where he took his bride after marriage, remained his mother, his younger brother, and a married sister. Ultimately, the appellant left the house of her husband on 10th of December, 1957, and went to reside with her parents. The parties differ as to the cause of such desertion. According to the appellant, she was compelled to flee on account of intense mental torture to which she was subjected by the inmates of her husband's house, as she had not brought sufficient dowry along with her. According to the husband, she developed illicit intimacy with one Ram Narayan and committed adultery with him, and lastly left the house of her own accord in company with her paramour. 2. On 20th of January, 1958, the respondent (husband) initiated proceedings under Section 10(1)(f) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, praying for a decree for judicial separation. This proceeding was numbered as O. S. 3/58. The appellant appeared and contested and denied the allegations of adultery levelled against her. During the course of this proceeding a daughter was born to the appellant. The husband amended his application for judicial separation by making the supplementary allegation that this daughter is an illegitimate issue born out of adulterous connection of the appellant with Rama Narayan. This amendment was allowed and the appellant filed her additional written statement denying these fresh allegations. The appellant contested the said proceeding and as the order-sheet of that case would indicate, she took steps on 5-2-61 for issuance of summons on her witnesses obviously to participate in the trial. The case was set down for final hearing on 8-9-61. On that day the appellant did not appear and her counsel Sri P.C. Misra entered no instructions and filed a letter, alleged to have been written by the appellant to him (proved in this case as Ext. 1). The case was heard ex parte that very day, and was posted to 9-9-61 for judgment. On that day an order was passed declaring that the husband is entitled to a decree for judicial separation from his wife. 3. On 23rd/27th November, 1962, the appellant filed an application for rescinding the decree for judicial separation purporting to be one under Order 9, Rule 13, C. P. C., but it was treated as one under Section 10(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, and disposed of as such. On the basis of this application, Misc. Case No. 1/63 was registered. This case has been dismissed by the common judgment out of which both these aforesaid appeals arise. M. A. No. 103 of 1965 is from that part of the judgment by which the Misc. Case No. 1/63 was dismissed. 4. Subsequently on 19-10-63 the respondent filed an application under Section 13(1) (i) and (viii) of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce. This proceeding was numbered as O. S. 35 of 1963. ThisAnupama Misra vs Bhagaban Misra on 1 November, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159445/ 1proceeding was heard analogously with the aforesaid Misc. Case No. 1/63 and both proceedings were disposed of by a common judgment by the 1st Additional District Judge of Cuttack. The suit for divorce has been decreed. M. A. No. 59/65 is from this decree. 5. The ex parte decree for judicial separation was passed in O. S. 3/58 on the ground that the appellant had, after the solemnisation of her marriage with the respondent, sexual intercourse with one Rama Narayan. This ground is covered by Section 10(1)(f) of Hindu Marriage Act 1955. Evidence substantiating this ground was adduced ex parte, and was not subject to cross-examination. 6. The proceeding for divorce (O. S. 35/63) is based on two grounds, namely, (a) that the petitioner is living in adultery, and (b) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period of two years after passing of the decree for judicial separation. 7. It is clear from the narration of the facts given above that if the Misc. Case No. 1/63 succeeds and the decree for judicial separation is set aside, then the decree for divorce cannot be granted on the ground that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties for a period of two years or upwards after passing of the decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they were parties. The proceedings for judicial separation must be restored to its pre-trial stage and the appellant must be given an opportunity to contest the same. I will, therefore, deal with Misc. Case No. 1/63 which is the subject-matter of M. A. No. 103/65. The petition which was filed in O. S. 3/58 claimed the relief to rescind the decree for judicial separation. It was in fact one envisaged under Section 10(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, and also so treated by the lower court and the parties. The respondent also filed objections to this application praying for . its dismissal. The main contentions of the petitioner in that application are contained in paragraphs 12 to 17 which are quoted herein below: ""(12) That the opposite party agreed to reconciliation and to live with the petitioner, but at the same time, wanted the petitioner to drop out of the proceeding so that the judicial separation proceeding would terminate in his favour and Thereafter both of them would live together. The aforesaid arrangement for getting the proceeding decreed ex parte was explained to the petitioner to be beneficial for her interest which she believed in good faith. The opposite party also gave out that since such a proceeding has been initiated and p roceeded so far, it will otherwise affect is career, in case the same is withdrawn or dismissed. 13. That in view of the aforesaid arrangement and understanding as between her and the opposite party the petitioner did not like to contest the matter any further and accordingly wrote a letter to her advocate Sri P.C. Misra. It is submitted that the petitioner had reliance on her husband all through and believed him in good faith as a devoted Hindu wife in spite of a series of injustice which had been done to her. 14. That the opposite party had access to the petitioner during the pendency of the proceeding for judicial separation and thereafter and the petitioner who believed her husband and had faith in himAnupama Misra vs Bhagaban Misra on 1 November, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159445/ 2and had to submit to his whims from time to time under the circumstances narrated above. 15. That in accordance with the arrangement and understanding as stated in paragraphs 12 and 13 above, the opposite party lived with the petitioner in their house at Rajnagar, P.S. Rajnagar, P.O. Kerara, District Cuttack where she has given birth to another baby on 16-7-62 born out of the sexual intercourse of the opposite party with the petitioner. It is submitted that after an ex parte decree for judicial separation was obtained under the aforesaid circumstances, the opposite party has cohabited with the petitioner and as such the said decree has become ineffective and infructuous. 16. That the petitioner submits that the rights of the respective parties which flowed from the marriage and supposed to be under suspension after the decree for judicial separation were restored by the aforesaid conduct of the parties. 17. That the ex parte decree for judicial separation was never intended to be given effect to nor in fact the same was acted upon by the parties inasmuch as the decree was obtained under express arrangements between the parties."" The appellant's letter to her lawyer Sri P.C. Misra requesting the latter not to proceed further in the case is dated 7-9-61 and has been proved as Ext. 1. It recited that her husband, the respondent, approached her on 29-8-61 and again on 2-9-61 and broached the subject of compromising the proceeding regarding judicial separation. It was settled between them that the judicial separation proceeding should be decreed and thereafter he will live with her as her husband in amity as before, and that she believed in this assurance of her husband and having complete faith in such assurance she did not contest the proceeding for judicial separation any further. This letter, Ext. 1, was filed by the appellant's lawyer along with a memo. The contents of this letter (Ext. 1) ostensibly show that the appellant did not contest due to some understanding or arrangement between her and the respondent. 8. I will now refer to the relevant provisions of Hindu Marriage Act, to determine if the appellant is entitled to ask for rescission of the decree of judicial separation. The material portions of Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, germane to the point under consideration, may be quoted: ""Section 10(1).

This is an appeal by the original petitioner against the judgment and order dated 14th October 1968 of a Judge of the Bombay City Civil Court dismissing his petition for divorce under Section 13(1-A) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Hindu Marriage Act""). The petitioner is the husband. The respondent is the wife. 2. The brief facts leading to this litigation are that the petitioner was married to the respondent on 22nd February 1961 in Nagpur according to Hindu Vedic rites. On 26th June 1964 the respondent filed in the Court of the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division Nagpur, a petition for judicial separation inter alia under Section 10(1)(a) and (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the grounds of desertion and cruelty. On 12th January 1965 a decree for judicial separation was passed in favour of the respondent. There are fortunately no children of the marriage. 3. Thereafter in 1968 the petitioner filed in the Bombay City Civil Court the petition from which the present appeal arises under Section 13(1-A) of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for divorce on the ground that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period or upwards of two years after the passing of the decree for judicial separation. The said petition was dismissed by the Bombay City Civil Court on 14th October 1968 by the order under appeal. Against the said order of dismissal the present appeal has been filed by the petitioner husband in this Court against his wife the respondent. 4. The ground given by the learned Judge for the dismissal of the petition is that Section 13(1-A) of the Hindu Marriage Act is controlled by Section 23 of the said Act and that by virtue of the said provision if any of the grounds for granting relief exists the Court shall decree such relief provided the petitioner is not in any way taking advantage of his own wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief. The learned Judge proceeds to observe that the decree for judicial separation in favour of the respondent was passed on the ground of cruelty and because the respondent was ill-treated. The learned Judge took the view that after the decree for judicial separation in favour of the respondent was passed the petitioner should have assured the respondent that he would treat her well, and that as there was no evidence before the Court that the petitioner had at any time assured the respondent that he would treat her well and that as there was also no evidence that he had asked her to come back and stay with him and she had refused, the petitioner was taking advantage of his own wrong and was not entitled to relief under Section 13(1-A). The learned Judge appears to have taken the view that a decree for judicial separation having been passed against the petitioner in consequence of his own wrong the petitioner must remedy that wrong to become entitled to a decree for divorce, otherwise in applying for a decree for divorce he was taking advantage of his own wrong which led to the decree of judicial separation in favour of his wife.Madhukar Bhaskar Sheorey vs Saral Madhukar Sheorey on 7 December, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/450821/ 15. The respondent wife remained absent and was ex-parte in the Bombay City Civil Court. She is also ex parte here. As I found that an important question might arise as to whether after a decree for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty was passed in favour of the respondent wife the petitioner husband was under any obligation to remedy that wrong and to give an assurance to be treated with cruelty or that she would be treated well and to call upon the respondent to come back and live with him. I requested Mr. M.L.Pendse to appear amicus curiae and argue the matter. He has been good enough to do so and has rendered valuable assistance in the matter. 6. There appears to be little doubt that under Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act it is the conduct of the petitioner after the passing of the decree for judicial separation that is to be taken into consideration in deciding whether the petitioner is or is not in any way taking advantage of his own wrong. In my opinion, Section 23(1)(a) has no reference to the past conduct of the petitioner such as cruelty which may have led to the passing of the decree for judicial separation. The wrong or disability referred to in Section 23(1)(a) must be a ""wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief"" as the petitioner wants in the petition then before the Court and not the wrong of the petitioner which was the subject-matter of the previous petition for judicial separation. The ground for the granting of the relief of judicial separation is the matrimonial offence of wrong or cruelty whereas the ground for the granting of the relief of divorce is that after passing of the decree for judicial separation, there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period of two years or upwards. The reference in that case is to an existing state of affairs between the parties to the marriage, that is that there has been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties for a period of two years or upwards. The reference is not to a matrimonial offence or wrong committed by a party. As I will show a little later the enactment of Section 13(1-A) in 1964 is a legislative recognition of the principle that in the interest of society if there has been a breakdown of the marriage, there is no purpose in keeping the parties tied down to each other. 7. After the enactment of Section 13(1-A) of the Hindu Marriage Act by the Hindu Marriage (Amendment) Act, 1964 the various High Courts have had occasion to deal with the matter. In the case of Laxmibai Laxmichand Shah v. Laxmichand Ravi Shah, the wife had obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding instituted by her for that relief. Later the husband initiated proceedings for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of a divorce on the ground that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of the decree or restitution of conjugal rights. There was evidence before the Court to show that the husband had willfully refused to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights after being called upon to do so. The learned trial Judge was of the view that this was irrelevant. On appeal my brother Chandrachud. J. held that under Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act it is open to the Court of refuse to pass a decree for divorce under Section 13(1-A) on a petition filed by a party who has refused to resume cohabitation for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree against such person for restitution of conjugal rights. He therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the decree for divorce passed by the trial Court. It is clear that what Chandrachud. J. took into consideration was the conduct of the petitioner husband subsequent to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights in as must as he refused to comply with the decree of the Court and not his conduct which led to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights.Madhukar Bhaskar Sheorey vs Saral Madhukar Sheorey on 7 December, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/450821/ 28. In the case of Ishwar Chander Ahluwalia v. Shrimati Poomilla Ahluwalia, , there was a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in favour of the husband against the wife. After the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights the husband took further proceedings for having the marriage declared a nullity on the ground of fraud thus making it impossible for the wife to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. It was held by Falshaw. C. J. of the Punjab High Court that it was impossible for the wife to make any effort to comply with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights as long as the husband was proceeding with the petition for nullity of the marriage. The husband ought at least to have waited for a period of two years after the dismissal of his nullity proceedings before he could legitimately claim for divorce. The husband was therefore refused relief under Section 13(1)(ix) by virtue of S. 23(1). Here again the Court took into consideration the conduct of the husband subsequent to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights in his favour which disentitled him to a decree for divorce. I might observe that this was a case prior to the passing of Section 13(1-A) in 1964 and was under the repealed Clause (ix) of Section 13(1). 9. In the case of Chaman Lal Chuni Lal v. Smt. Mohinder Devi. , there was a decree for restitution in favour of the wife. The husband refused to comply with the decree though called upon to do so. He thereafter filed a petition for divorce under Section 13(1-A). His petition was however dismissed and the High Court took the view that the husband was taking advantage of his own wrong and that a decree for restitution of conjugal rights having been passed against him it was his duty to make efforts to comply with the said decree. He could not avoid the restitution of conjugal rights for two years after the decree and then make a petition for divorce on that ground that taking advantage of his own wrong. The conduct of the husband which disentitled him to a decree for divorce was his conduct subsequent to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. 10. In the case of M.Someswara v. Leelavathi, AIR 1968 Mys 274 there was a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in favour of the husband. In compliance with the decree the wife went and lived with the husband for a few days. She however left him after the few days alleging that he was cruel. The husband subsequently filed a petition for divorce under Section 13(1-A). The wife proved for allegation of cruelty. Relief was refused to the husband on the ground that by being cruel to his wife and preventing her from complying with the decree for restitution of conjugal rights and thereafter applying for divorce, he was taking advantage of his own wrong. Here again it was the conduct of the husband in whose favour the decree for restitution of conjugal rights had been passed subsequent to the passing of the decree that was taken into consideration. 11. The Hindu Marriage Act was passed in 1955. Prior to that there was judicial separation and divorce in the States of Bombay and Madras, but we are not concerned with that aspect of the matter. Statutory provision for judicial separation and divorce was introduced in the whole of India for the first time in 1955. Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides six grounds for a decree for judicial separation. Three of the grounds, namely desertion, cruelty and isolated acts of adultery are grounds which arise from a wrong committed by one of the parties to the marriage. The remaining three grounds namely, one of venereal disease or insanity may arise without a wrong committed by a party to the marriage. In all the six cases Section 10(2) provides that after the passing of the decree for judicial separation the Court may rescind the decree in proper cases. This may be if the Court isMadhukar Bhaskar Sheorey vs Saral Madhukar Sheorey on 7 December, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/450821/ 3","['13', '23', '10']"

(1) The appellant filed before the court of the civil Judge at Chitradurga Miscellaneous Petition No. 97 of 1962 against his wife under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for a decree for judicial separation. The said petition was filed on 16th October 1962. The respondent appeared on 22nd December 1962 and was granted time to file her objections till 19-1-1963. After receiving her objections on the latter date, the matter was posted for evidence to 23rd February 1963. As the Judge was on casual leave on the said date, it was adjourned to 30th March 1963. On the date, it was adjourned at the request of the appellant petitioner's counsel. Four similar adjournments followed at the request of the petitioner's counsel until on 1-2-1964 the Civil Judge came to passes the following order. ""Petitioner by Sri. N. S. A. Respondent by Sri. B.M. Evidence: Sri. N.S.A. prays for permission to retire for want of instructions. Petitioner called out and absent. Respondent by Sri. B.M. petition is dismissed. No costs"" The appeal is against the said order of 1-2-1964. (2) It is stated that the appellant has also filed before the civil Judge an application under Rule 9 of Order IX of he Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the same order dismissing his petition for default. (3) Mr. Shankarlingappa, learned counsel for the respondent, has raised a preliminary objection contending that the appeal before this Court is not maintainable firstly on the ground that the order appealed from cannot be said to be an appealable order at all, and alternatively on the ground that the appeal is barred by the petitioner having chosen to move the lower Court under Rule 9 of Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure. (4)The answer made to this preliminary objection by Mr. Tarakaram on behalf of the appellant is that the order of the lower court is clearly appealable under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that the application under Rule 9 of Order IX of the Code was presented to the lower court after the presentation of this appeal on his advice because the question whether a petition under any of the sections of the Hindu Marriage Act can be dismissed under Rule 8 of Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure is itself a matter for some doubt. (5) Whether or not the provisions of Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure apply to or may be invoked in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, we do not think that the respondent is right in contending that the order appealed from is not an appealable order at all.Tirukappa vs Kamalamma on 17 January, 1965 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/468046/ 1(6) As pointed out by this court in Dhulappa v. Krishnabai, AIR 1962 Mysore 172, appealability of orders made under the Hindu Marriage Act is provided for in section 28 of the Act which divides adjudications or determination under the said Act into two categories--decrees and orders,--although according to the definitions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure all such determinations can be regarded only as orders. It is also pointed out that the purpose of such nomenclature is to provide for the possibility of two appeals, under sections 96 and 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with S. 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act so far as determination called decrees therein are concerned, and to provide, in all cases for one appeal against determinations called orders under that Act. (7) Order IX of the Code deals exclusively with suits, i.e., original proceedings commenced with the presentation of a plaint under the Code of Civil Procedure. An order of dismissal for default of plaintiff's appearance under Rule 8 of Order IX of the said Code is not one of the appealable orders under Rule 1 of Order XLIII. The reason therefor is obvious, viz., that the provisions of Rule 9 of Order IX precluding the plaintiff form bringing a fresh suit on the same cause of action render the order of dismissal under Rule 8 a final adjudication against the plaintiff and should therefore be followed by a regular decree dismissing the suit, against which decree the plaintiff would have right of appeal. By parity of reasoning, an order dismissing a proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act for the default of petitioner's appearance under Rule 8 of Order IX of the Code.--if it applies to such proceedings,--should necessarily amount to a final determination of such proceedings, and if the proceeding is one under section 10 as in the present case, such final adjudication should be regarded as a decree within the meaning of the Act and therefore appealable as such under section 28 of the Act as explained by this Court in AIR 1962 Mys 172. (8) In any event therefore, there can be no doubt that the order appealed from in this case is clearly an appealable order. (9) For determining the effect of the second argument, viz., that the appellant's application to the trial court under rule 9 of Order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure operates as a bar to this appeal. It is necessary to examine the question whether rules 8 and 9 of the said Order 9 apply to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. (10) Starting with the undoubted position that the jurisdiction and powers under the Hindu Marriage Act are vested in and exerciseable by ordinary civil Courts, there should not prima facie be any difficulty in accepting the normal consequences of such a situation, viz., that the procedure prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure is available. That is the general effect of Ss. 9, 4(1) and 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That is also what, in our opinion, is provided by section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act itself which reads as follows: ""Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.""Tirukappa vs Kamalamma on 17 January, 1965 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/468046/ 2(11) In interpreting the language of this section emphasis has been placed on two expressions, viz., that the Civil Procedure Code only 'regulates' the proceedings under the Act and that such regulation is subject to other provisions contained in the Act. (12) The first expression, it is suggested, has the same effect as Section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure according to which what is made applicable to all proceedings in any Court of civil jurisdiction is 'the procedure provided in the Code'. On this basis, some cases are cited before us in which an attempt has been made to distinguish between those provisions of the Code which may be regarded as merely procedural in nature and those which should be regarded as enacting a rule of substantive law. Sitaram v. Baburao, AIR 1953 Nag. 153 is a case in which it was held that rule 8 of order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted a rule of substantive law, and should not therefore be applied to proceedings under section 144 of the said Code by virtue of section 141 thereof. In Prasanna Ghose v. Satish Chandra, AIR 1943 Cal 152, Rule 9 of Order 9 was held to be inapplicable to an application or a miscellaneous proceeding under Section 36(6)(a) of the Bengal Money Lenders Act, principally on the ground that the said provision of the Code applies in term to a suit only and not an application. (13) We do not think that the proposition sought to be made on the basis of these decisions can rightly be applied to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. In the first place the proposition that either Rule 8 or Rule 9 of O. 9 or both of them together must be taken to enact a rule of substantive law may stand further consideration and scrutiny. In one sense the Code of Civil Procedure can hardly be taken to enact any rule of substantive law, if we understand the expression 'substantive law' to mean law which creates or confers on individuals a certain legal right or imposes a certain legal liability or obligation. The Code of Civil Procedure is a law which relates to procedure of courts to investigate into and adjudicate upon disputes in regard to substantive rights claimed by one party and denied by another. If this view of the matter is borne in mind, it may not be quite accurate to say that any provision of the Code of Civil Procedure enacts any rule of substantive law. In regard to such provisions as S. 11 or R. 9 of O. 9 or sub-rule (3)of Rule 1 of Order 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the better view to take, in our opinion, would be not to regard them as enacting any rule of substantive law but as provisions which lay down the consequences which the failure to observe certain of the provisions regulating procedure has on the substantive rights which are the subject of adjudication by civil court. Indeed we might point out that the very title given to Order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure is ""Appearance of parties and Consequences of Non-appearance"". In Venkatamma v. Seethaiah, 1960-1 Andh WR 1 a Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dealing with Section 5(4) of the Hindu (Bigamy Prevention and Divorce) Act which states that procedure provided in the Code of Civil Procedure in regard to suits shall be followed as far as it can be made applicable in all proceedings in any petition presented under sub-section (1) or (2) thereof, applied Rule 13 of Order 9, pointing out that Order 9 which deals with appearance of parties and consequence of the non-appearance is part of the procedure applicable to trial of suits and should therefore be applied to proceedings under the said Act. (14) It is nevertheless argued that proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act could be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure only subject to the other provisions of the Act and that a dismissal for default under Rule 8 of Order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure would be violative of some of theTirukappa vs Kamalamma on 17 January, 1965 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/468046/ 3","['10', '5', '14', '28']"

Bijoli Choudhury vs Sukomal Choudhury on 10 July, 1978 Equivalent citations: AIR 1979 Cal 87 Author: C Mookerjee Bench: C Mookerjee, B C Ray JUDGMENT Chittatosh Mookerjee, J. 1. On February 27, 1963 the respondent Sukomal Choudhury, had married the appellant, Bijoli Choudhnry, according to Buddhist Rites at P 12/1, Dihi Serampore Road, P. S. Beniapu-kur, Calcutta. On 23rd November, 1972 the respondent-husband presented a petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the District Judge's Court, Alipore praying for a decree of judicial separation. The present appellant contested the said case. The learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Alipore by his judgment dated 7th July, 1975 granted a decree for judicial separation on the ground that the appellant had treated her husband respondent herein with cruelty within the meaning of Section 10(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to the learned Additional District Judge, she had also deserted her husband for two years or more within the meaning of Section 10(1)(b) of the said Act. The appellant wife has presented this appeal against the said decision of the learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court Alipore. During the pendency of this appeal the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 was enacted which inter-alia made several amendments in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1953. The respondent husband has filed an application in this Court for amendment of his petition/plaint filed in the Court below inter-alia for inserting a prayer that a decree of divorce be granted to him under Clause (ia) and (ib) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, The said application of the respondent husband has been heard along with the appeal preferred by the appellant wife. We have to consider whether or not the learned Additional District Judge has correctly found that the appellant wife after solemnisation of the marriage had treated her husband with cruelty and whether or not she had deserted him for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding to presentation of the petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. Both the appellant and the respondent, as already stated, are Buddhists and their families came from the district of Chittagong. The respondent husband in his evidence stated that when he was aged five, both his father and mother had died. He was brought up by his grandmother and then by his aunt. According to the appellant wife her farher used to give monetary help to her husband even before he married her. The respondent husband however did not admit the said fact But even according to him, he had started living in the house of his prospective father-in-law three months before his M. A. examination. In November, 1962 the respondent had passed the M. A. examination in Pali language and he stood first in the first class. On 27th March, 1963 the marriage between the parties took place at the residence of the appellant's father at Dihi Serampore Road, Calcutta and the respondent continued to live in his father-in-law's house. 3. The respondent husband in paragraph 6 of his petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act had claimed that the marital life of the parties had started quite happily and their days were passing normally except for minor differences of views over small matters. He had further averred in his petition under Section 10 of the Act that in or about the year 1965 the appellant slowly had aSm. Bijoli Choudhury vs Sukomal Choudhury on 10 July, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168114/ 1change in her behaviour. She became arrogant about her father's status in society in comparison with his family and his social status. She showed her undue superiority complex and vanity. She tried to subdue him with an air of superiority. In the year 1966 the appellant had become pregnant. She did not allow the doctors and nurses to examine her condition and abused and misbehaved with them. The baby was seriously injured during delivery and died six days after. After this, according to the husband, his wife showed landslide change in her behaviour for the worse. She became nagging and on every word or act of the petitioner would find fault with him and abused him"". She was full of Uncontrollable rage and used filthy abuses. The husband further alleged that she did not hesitate to raise her hands on him. The husband in his petition also alleged that he used to impart occasional coaching to a girl student. His wife used to suspect him of being immorally involved with the girl student and on this account abused and insulted him. Even while he was teaching the girl student, the wife had also stood in the way of her husband from visiting Harvard University in U. S. A. for doing research work. He was not allowed to take up a post in the Benaras Hindu University. 4. The husband in his petition further alleged that his wife under sadistic cravings had drugged him and he had become sick with severe infection in his stomach. The doctors had given up hope of curing him. He was shifted to a rented house where his relatives arranged for his treatment. His wife was brought there against her will but she had misbehaved with his relatives and had left him on her own accord with positive intention of not returning again. Thereafter, the husband was allegedly cured by means ot a supernatural drug. The husband claimed in his petition under Section 10 that he had always hoped that with the passage of time his wife would understand his difficulties and would mend her habits and manners. He had patiently waited but his hopes were shattered. She and her men had threatened him time and again unless he would agree to go back to his father-in-law's house. She had tried to vilify and humiliate her husband on many occasions by going to his college and residence with her associates and hired goondas propagating and throwing insults against him. She had maliciously written offensive letters to the college authorities and other persons levelling false accusation. He was thereby humiliated. She had published offensive leaflets levelling false accusation against him. The respondent husband in his petition under Section 10 inter alia averred that from the conduct of his wife he had a reasonable doubt that if he lived with her, it would be harmful and injurious both for his mind and body. Hence he had been compelled to apply for judicial separation. The husband in his petition had also alleged that his wife had established an illicit relation and intimacy with one Debabrata Chakraborty. The said allegation however, was not ultimately pressed and Mr. B. K. Ghosh, learned advocate, for the respondent in this appeal, also submitted that his client does not wish to make any submission in respect of the said allegation against the appellant. The trial Court allowed the husband's prayer for amendment of the petition under Section 10 containing the alleged particulars of mental cruelty of his wife. The respondent husband had examined one Sambhu Nath Chatterjee as P. W. 1 and himself as P. W. 2. He had proved some letters written by his wife Bijoli. The appellant wife had examined her sister and herself. She had also produced some letters to rebut the case against her. The learned Additional District Judge believed the evidence given on the husband's side, found that the wife was guilty of mental cruelty towards her husband, The learned Additional District Judge did not record any finding of physical cruelty against the wife and in fact at the trial the husband did not attempt to prove the said kind of cruelty. The learned Additional District Judge held that the real trouble had started when the husband started coaching a girl student named Lipika and the wife had falselySm. Bijoli Choudhury vs Sukomal Choudhury on 10 July, 1978 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168114/ 2alleged that there was an improper or immoral relationship between her husband and Lipika. The wife by making false allegations about his conduct and behaviour had shocked her husband. The learned Additional District Judge further held that it was for the wife to prove that her husband had been living in adultery with Sarbani Chatterjee, daughter of Sambhu Nath Chatterjee, P. W. 1. The learned Additional District Judge held that the said allegations to be absolutely a myth and that the wife with a view to damaging the reputation and character of her husband had cooked up the said story. The wife had made false allegations against her husband by writing letters, making representations and by circulating leaflets. Therefore, she was guilty of acts of cruelty within the meaning of Section 10(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Additional District Judge also found that the wife had deserted her husband in the year 1967. 5. We may proceed to examine the evidence adduced in the case in the light of the probabilities and surrounding circumstances. Admittedly, the respondent Sukomal was given shelter in the house of the appellant's father some time before he appeared in the M A. Examination and after his marriage with the appellant on 27th March, 1963 the parries had lived at the residence of the appellant's father. At the beginning the wife's behaviour towards her husband was good, even according to her husband but he alleged that about one and half years after their marriage his wife changed her behaviour. One and half years from the date of their marriage would be about the last quarter of the year 1964 But no credible reason was given by Sukomal for this change of attitude of his wife apart from his vague allegations of her exhibiting a superiority complex towards him because of differences in their social status. In fact, in his petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the husband had alleged that from the year 1965 his wife had begun to misbehave. According to the evidence given by him his father-in-law was a Clearing Agent of the Customs Department but there was no precise evidence about the financial condition of the wife's family. There was no evidence that Bijoli's fattier compared to her husband enjoyed a high social status. There was no reason for considering Sukomal as inferior in any way. He was holder of a 1st Class Master's degree. In April, 1964 he was offered admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science of Harvard University (vide Ext. 1). In November, 1964 the respondent was appointed as a Lecturer in the Government Sanskrit College. Therefore, it was highly improbable that his wife would have ill-treated him and in fact in the year 1965 when he was no longer an unemployed person. Some relatives of the respondent husband lived at Jalpaiguri and both the husband and the wife several times had visited them. The plaintiff busband did not attempt to prove the allegations in paragraph 10 of his petition under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act that his wife had demonstrated with unusual vanity and superiority complex and had quarrelled with the members of his family or that she used to despise or hate them. In fact, apart from examining Sambhu Nath Chatterjee, P. W. 1, in whose tenanted house the husband had (been) allegedly living as a paying-guest in the end of the year 1967, no relative of the two parties was examined as a witness to prove that Bijoli had ill-treated her husband and his relatives. Therefore, there was no corroboration of these vague and general statements made by the husband in course of his evidence that his wife used to display a superiority complex and that she used to abuse and insult him. The parties had recently married, both were young and the husband who was a qualified person had secured a Lecturership in the Government Sanskrit College.

Bhattacharjee, J. 1. This matrimonial appeal by the wife-appellant was preferred beyond the period of limitation, but the delay has been condoned under Section 5 of the Limitation Act on an application filed subsequent to the presentation of the appeal. Mr. D. Roze, the learned counsel appearing for the husband-respondent has now urged, and has urged very seriously, that the order condoning the delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was patently erroneous for two reasons. Mr. D. Roze has contended that, firstly, Section 5 of the Limitation Act cannot have any manner of application to a matrimonial proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act including an Appeal, and, secondly, even if the Section applies, the application thereunder ought to have accompanied the memorandum of appeal as now required by Rule 3A of the Code of Civil Procedure, inserted by the Amendment Act of 1976, and such an application having filed later, the delay could not be condoned. 2. An appeal against a decree under the Hindu Marriage Act is provided in Section 28(1) of the said Act and the period of limitation therefor is prescribed in Section 28(4). It is neither an appeal under the general law, i.e., the Code of Civil Procedure, nor the period of limitation therefor is prescribed under the general law, i.e., the Limitation Act, for if it were so, these provisions in Section 28 would not have been necessary. The Division Bench decisions of this court in Sohhana v. Amar, and in Pratima v. Kamal, (1964) 68 Cal WN 316 are clear authorities for the view that an appeal against a decree under the Hindu Marriage Act is an appeal under Section 28 of that Act and not an appeal under the general law. The Division Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in Madhukar v. Malti is also to that effect. All these decisions were rendered under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act as it stood before 1976, but the present Section 28, as amended by the Amendment Act of 1976, makes the position clearer and Section 21B of the Act, also inserted by the said Amendment Act, puts the matter beyond all controversy by describing, in Sub-section(3), an appeal against a decree or order passed under the Hindu Marriage Act as an ""appeal under this Act"", i.e. the Hindu Marriage Act. 3. Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act makes the provisions of Sections 3 to 25 thereof applicable to all suits, appeals and applications under any 'special law' and there should be no doubt that the Hindu Marriage Act, or for the matter of that, its Section 28(4), is a 'special law' within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. Even if Section 41 of the Penal Code, defining 'special law' as ""a law applicable to a particular subject"" is not directly available for the construction of the same expression in Section 29(2), Limitation Act, the expression, as pointed out by the Supreme Court in Kaushalya Rani v. Gopal Singh, , would very much mean a law enacted for special or particular subject in contradistinction to general rules of the law laid down as applicable generally to all cases with which the general law deals. Under Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, therefore, the provisions of Sections 3 to 25, including obviously Section 5, would have been applicable to an appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act.Sm. Sipra Dey vs Ajit Kumar Dey on 2 September, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1794278/ 14. But Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act, however, provides that ""save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any such law"". It has been urged by Mr. D. Roze that even though the expression 'suit' in Section 29(3) may not include 'appeal' because of Section 2(1), the expression 'proceeding' would, lexically, logically and also legally include an 'appeal'. We would agree with Mr. D. Roze that, by itself, the expression 'proceeding' is wide enough to include appeal and in fact in a sense 'proceeding' is the genus of which suit, appeal and application are different species. But in a given context and in conjunction with other words, the expression 'proceeding' like any other expression, may very often have a different and limited meaning. A word, like a man, is very often known by the company it keeps and accordingly, a word is very often to be understood in the context and collocation it is used. This rule of interpretation is known as noscitur a sociis which is much wider than the rule of ejusdem generis, and in fact the latter rule is only an illustration or application of the former. The rule is, as Maxwell puts it (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes -- 10th Edition, P. 332), that ""when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together noscitur a sociis, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense"" and ""they take, as it were, their colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to the less general"". As observed by Gajendragadkar J.,(as his Lordship then was), in the Supreme Court decision in State of Bombay v. Hospital Mazdoor Sabha, , ""associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it; such doctrine is broader than the maxim ejusdem generis"" and that ""in fact the latter maxim is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscitur a sociis'. As has been pointed out further, ""it must be borne in mind that noscitur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. It is only where the intention of the Legislature, in associating wider words with words of narrower significance is doubtful, or otherwise not clear, that the present rule of construction can be usefully applied. It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful...."" 5. We are satisfied that even though lexically, logically and in common as well as legal parlance, the expression 'proceeding' includes an appeal, an application and even a suit, there are good and weighty reasons to apply the rule of noscitur a sociis to the word proceeding in the expression suit or other proceeding in Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act and to construe the same to mean proceeding in the nature of suit, that is, original proceeding and not to include appeal. The reasons are as hereunder. 6. The Limitation Acts have never been applied to original criminal prosecutions as a matter of public policy as the State and the Society are interested in such prosecutions which should not be forestalled by mere efflux of time. The State and the Society are also similarly interested in the healthy, orderly and stable growth of the families and for the same reason, Limitation Acts have never provided any period of limitation for filing suits or original Petitions for matrimonial reliefs. But as the State and the Society are also vitally interested in the finality of all litigations, including criminal or matrimonial litigations -- interest republicae ut sit finis litium -- the preceding Limitation Act of 1908 clearly provided for periods of limitation for criminal appeals in variousSm. Sipra Dey vs Ajit Kumar Dey on 2 September, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1794278/ 2Articles and Section 29(3) of that Act of 1908 excluded from its operation only the suits under the Indian Divorce Act (that being then the only Statute providing for matrimonial reliefs), but not the appeals. That appeals from the decrees under the Divorce Act were governed by the Limitation Acts was decided by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court as early as in 1898 in A v. B (ILR 22 Bom 612). That being the scheme and purpose of the earlier Limitation Acts, we would not like to construe the expression proceeding in Section 29(3) of the present Limitation Act to include appeal also so as to exclude all matrimonial appeals from the purview of the provisions of the Limitation Act 7. A survey of the provisions of the present Limitation Act would also demonstrate that whenever provisions have been made for appeals, the Legislature has expressly used the expression appeal as in Sections 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 29, 30 and 31 of the Act and that being the general frame of the Act, we are inclined to think that if the Legislature intended to make the provisions of Section 29(3) applicable to appeals also, it would have clearly said so in express words. The very preceding Sub-section(2) of Section 29 has also used the expression suit, appeal and application instead of the expression proceeding as that sub-section was clearly intended to apply to appeal also. Our attention, could not be drawn to any section or Article of the Limitation Act applying to appeals which has, without expressly using the expression appeal, has used the wider expression proceeding. 8. Some of the provisions of the Limitation Act relating to appeals enact principles which are eminently 'reasonable' and evidently 'right', 'just and fair.' For example, it is obviously reasonable to provide, as provided in Section 12, that the time requisite for obtaining copies of the judgment and decree shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation for the appeal. The provision of Section 5 empowering the Court to admit appeal even after the prescribed period for good and sufficient cause is also another such provision To construe the word proceeding in Section 29(3) to include appeal would be to overthrow all these reasonable provisions in respect of appeal, while to construe the same as to exclude appeal and to mean only original proceeding in the nature of a suit would be to make all these reasonable provisions available to appeals. The tatter construction can easily be arrived at by applying the principle Noscitur A Sociis and since where two constructions are possible, that which would be more conducive to reason and justice is to be preferred, we would adopt that construction. 9. Mr. D. Roze has, however, drawn our attention to the provisions of the Long Title of the Act where the Act has been described as ""An Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and other proceedings and for purposes connected therewith"" and Mr. D. Roze has urged that since the Act has provided for the limitation of suits as well as appeals and applications, the expression other proceedings in the Long Title obviously includes appeals and applications and that being so, the same meaning would have to be given to the same expression in Section 29(3). 10. We have given our anxious consideration to this argument. Even though the preceding Act of 1908 was passed for similar objects as the present Act, the Long Title of the preceding Act did not use the expression suits and other proceedings, but the Long Title was ""an Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and other purposes"" and the preamble thereof clearly spelt out that the Act was enacted ""to consolidate and amend the law relating to limitation of suits,Sm.

Bhattacharjee, J. 1. I have no doubt that we cannot but decline to confirm this decree nisi for dissolution of marriage passed by the learned District Judge in the Divorce Suit under Section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, which has come up before us for confirmation under Section 17 of the Act. I am, however, of opinion that, for the reasons stated hereinafter, a decree for divorce a mensa et thoro. i.e., a decree of judicial separation should instead be passed in favour of the petitioner-husband against the wife-respondent under Section 22 of the Divorce Act. 2. In Swapna Ghosh v. Sadananda Ghosh (SB) disposed of by this Bench, I have confessed my inability to appreciate the utility of retaining any longer the provisions of Section 17 of the Divorce Act of 1869, which compulsorily requires confirmation by this Court of the decree for dissolution of marriage passed by the District Court and that too, by a Bench of not less than three Judges. It may be that the concerned Legislature in that mid-nineteenth century intended the continuance of the marriage to be the rule and dissolution thereof to be the exception and attached so great importance to the continuance of marriage that it thought that a marriage could be allowed to be dissolved only after a District Judge had decreed the same and a three-Judge Bench of the High Court was also satisfied that it could not but be so decreed. Inspiration might have been derived from the law relating to Criminal Procedure whereunder a death-sentence could not, and even now cannot, be executed unless confirmed by the High Court and since the decree for divorce results in death of the marriage, the relevant law intended to express its very grave concern in respect of such a decree, as it did and still does in respect of a sentence of death. But as I have pointed out in some details in Swapna Ghosh (supra), under the Special Marriage Act of 1954 providing the general matrimonial law of the land and the various special matrimonial laws governing all the communities in India except the Christians like the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1936, the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 etc., a decree of dissolution by a District Court, and in some cases, even by Courts subordinate thereto, is final conclusive and binding, unless the party aggrieved chooses to prefer appeal, while, because of Section 17 of the Divorce Act, 1869, a similar decree between the Christian spouses would not acquire legal efficacy unless the proceedings are dragged to the High Court before a three-Judge Bench and confirmed by it. I have pointed out that these provisions under Section 17 have been very rightly done away with by an Amendment Act by the Uttar Pradesh State Legislature, being Uttar Pradesh Act No. 30 of 1957 and that, as has also been observed by a Special Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Neena v. John Parmer , it is high time that similar amendment is introduced in the Divorce Act by Parliament on all-India basis or at least by our State Legislature without waiting any further for that august body to move in its due course. I have also said that these provisions may also appear to have discriminated the Christians on the basis of religion alone thus transgressing Article 15 of the Constitution and also to be violative of procedural due process for denying procedural reasonableness to the Christians, inRamish Francis Toppo vs Violet Francis Toppo on 22 August, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808647/ 1the context of the other matrimonial laws operating in the country. Both my Lords Mookherjee, J. and Nayak, J., have been pleased to concur with me in holding that the question of introducing some such amendment deserves very serious consideration. But while his Lordship Mookherjee J., has, in his separate judgment (supra, at pp. 163-164 of (1988) 2 Cal LJ): (at pp. 5-6 of AIR)), expressly reserved his views on the constitutional questions raised by me, his Lordship Nayak, J., if I have read his separate judgment correctly, has held (supra) at p. 164 (of Cal LJ) : (at p. 6 of AIR) those questions also to warrant serious and in depth consideration. I have also, in Swapna Ghosh (supra), raised several other questions relating to the constitutional vires of some of the relevant provisions of the Divorce Act though I have not finally decided those questions in that case as determination of those questions were not indispensibly necessary for the disposal thereof. I could riot then lay hand on a decision of Alagiriswami, J., then of the Madras High Court (subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court) in Solomon Devasahayam Selvaraj v. Chandirah Mary (1968) 1 Mad LJ 289 and I am now glad to find that the learned Judge also thought it fit to advert to some of those questions and expressed himself (at p. 294) as hereunder: -- ""The Indian Divorce Act, 1869 is wholly out of date. Its provisions were exact copies of the English Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. Under that Act, it was enough if the husband proved adultery in order to enable him to get a divorce from his wife. On the other hand that was not enough for a wife to get a divorce against her husband. Something more must be proved. The law had been amended in England as early as 1923 by the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1923, putting the husband and the wife on equal footing. The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1937 added some more grounds for divorce. The law in India under the Hindu Marriage Act is practically the same as in England at present. The Parsi Marriage Act was amended in 1936 to put it more or less on the same basis as the English Law of 1937. Only the Divorce Act, which applies to Christians, is at least 50 years behind the times. No one will consider that the Christians are a backward community compared to the other communities in the country. It is high time that the Indian Divorce Act is brought in line with the Hindu Marriage Act, the Parsi Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Indeed, the Special Marriage Act even provides for divorce by consent of parties."" ""Another important matter is that under the Indian Divorce Act for cases arising inside the city of Madras, the High Court is the Court competent to try such cases whereas in the case of other communities the City Civil Court, Madras, can deal with the cases. What is more, a decree for dissolution of marriage, of nullity of marriage passed by a District Judge has to be confirmed by a Bench of three Judges of the High Court In the case of the other communities the Subordinate Courts are competent to deal with these matters and the ordinary provisions of appeal in civil cases apply. It is unfiecessary and wholly incongruous that the causes under the Indian Divorce Act, should be heard by a High Court Judge, in the city and decrees passed by District Judges should be confirmed by a Bench of three Judges of the High Court. It is necessary and it would be advisable, to bring the provisions of the Indian Divorce Act, in regard to divorce and judicial separation, in line with the provisions of the other three Acts already mentioned"". 3. Now to the merits the decree obtained by the petitioner-husband is an ex parte one as the wife-respondent did not turn up to contest the petition even though she filed her Written Statement. It needs hardly to be stated that a judicial proceeding, even if not defended or contested, can neverRamish Francis Toppo vs Violet Francis Toppo on 22 August, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1808647/ 2be a matter of easy insouciance but must be heard and determined with all due care and attention. But since the whole of our civilized society germinates around the institution of marriage which concerns not merely the spouses and the children but also the society at large and since the society itself is vitally interested in the maintenance of marriage and also its dissolution, wherever necessary, trial of matrimonial causes must, as a rule, be a matter of most anxious advertence. But even then, though the petitioner-husband in this case has only examined himself and there is no witness to corroborate him, I am nevertheless inclined to hold that the finding of the trial Judge that the wife-respondent has deserted the petitioner for more than two years without reasonable excuse is justified and should be affirmed. Not only we have the categorical and obviously unchallenged, assertion of the petitioner in his deposition that she ""left the matrimonial home on 1st January, 1981"" when she was pregnant, ""gave birth to a female child who died after one day's of birth"", ""did not give any information about (its) birth, death and cremation"", ""is not willing to come back"" and that the petitioner ""tried to get her back but to no effect"", we have also the wife's own admission in her written Statement about such leaving the matrimonial home and of not coming back thereto, as alleged It is true that, as has again been recently pointed out by a Division Bench of this Court in Kamal v. Kalyani , the mere fact of one spouse leaving the matrimonial home does not necessarily make him or her the deserter, unless it is shown to have been done with the requisite animus deserendi, i.e., the intention to desert and the animus non-revertendi, i.e., the intention not to return. But the wife-respondent in para 11 of her Written Statement has clearly asserted ""that the conduct of the petitioner is so abhorrent and heinous that no lady could keep any communion with him"". We are inclined to think that reading such assertion in the respondent's own Written Statement along with the case made out by the petitioner in his deposition, we can not but accept the case of the petitioner that the wife-respondent has deserted him having left the matrimonial home with the requisite animus deserendi and animus non-revertendi. 4. In her Written Statement, the wife-respondent has no doubt put forward a case of reasonable excuse for her withdrawing from the matrimonial home and has asserted that the conduct of the petitioner compelled her to do so. It is true, as pointed again in Kamal v. Kalyani (supra), in a matrimonial case on the ground of desertion, very often the question arises as to who has deserted and who is deserted, because the physical act of withdrawal or departure by one spouse does not necessarily make that spouse the deserting party. For, if a husband has behaved in such a way as to make it impossible for the wife to live in the matrimonial home and the wife in consequence leaves the home, may be with animus deserendi and animus non-revertendi, then, even if the wife has herself made the physical departure, she would not be guilty of desertion as the husband has given the wife reasonable cause to form such animus and to make the departure. But not only the wife has not turned up to prove such a case, there is also nothing on record to show that the conduct of the husband was such as to justify the wife to withdraw and depart. It is the wife's own case in the Written Statement that there has been a ""break up of the matrimonial home"" and that her life in that home became ""quite unbearable and this is the resultant act of coming away from the petitioner's dominion"". The deposition of the petitioner read in the light of these statements of the wife would give rise to the inference that the marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably.

Manashi (F.A. 345 of 1986, disposed of on 10-6-88) : () and also with the concurrence of Baboolal Jain, J., in Harendra v. Suprava (F.

This is an appeal by the husband, who has been unsuccessful in both Courts below. Very few facts are necessary for appreciation of the controversy arising in the appeal. Both the principal parties viz. the appellant and respondent No. 1, as well as respondent No. 2, are Hindus governed by the Hindu Law. In 1934 the appellant was married to respondent No. 2 according to Hindu rites and they lived as husband and wife. The appellant did not have any child by respondent No. 2. On 24th May 1959 the appellant went through a ceremony of marriage according to Hindu rites with respondent No. 1. A the time when this ceremony was gone through by the parties, respondent No. 2 was alive and she is still alive; and the marriage between the appellant and respondent No. 2 was subsisting then the is still subsisting. There is no dispute at this stage that the fact found show that in March 1963 the appellant and respondent No. 2 drove away respondent No. 1 and since then she has been residing with her parents. The averments in the pleadings and the evidence on record show that respondent No. 1 continued for five or six years to live with her parents in the hope that she would be again taken back by the appellant. In 1969 respondent No. 1 gave a notice to the appellant and demanded maintenance and thereafter filed a suit, being Regular Civil Suit No. 1 gave a notice to the appellant and demanded maintenance and thereafter filed a suit, being Regular Civil Suit No. 204 of 1970, in forma pauperis, for maintenance under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act of 1956""). The appellant resisted the suit and, inter alia, disputed the factum of marriage and status of respondent No. 1 as his wife and contended that the said marriage being void she was not entitled to any maintenance under the Act. Sometime in 1972 the appellant adopted a son and there after, on 11th December 1972, respondent No. 1 filed a petition being Hindu Marriage Petition No. 17 of 1972 in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Kolhapur, for a declaration that the marriage between her and the appellant was null and void and for maintenance at the rate of Rs. 150/- p.m. The appellant resisted the claim for maintenance made in this petition on the ground that the marriage purported to have been performed between him and respondent No. 1 was void as at the time when the said marriage was performed, respondent No. 2, who was his suppose, was living and contended that, in view of this, respondent No. 1 could not be said to be his wife and was not entitled to any maintenance. He also contended that the petition was barred by limitation. 2. The learned Civil Judge held that the marriage between the appellant and respondent No. 1 was null and void as contravening the provisions of Section 5(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. He further held that respondent No. 1 was entitled to permanent alimony at the rate of Rs. 125/- p. m. He rejected the contention of the appellant that respondent No. 1 had disentitled herself to relief on the grounds mentioned in Cls. (a) or (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. IN view of this petition having been allowed the learned Civil Judge dismissed the aforesaid suit No. 204 of 1970. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the learned Civil Judge in aforesaid petition, the appellant preferred an appeal in the District Court at Kolhapur being Civil Appeal No. 338 of 1973. This appeal was disposed of by the learned Assistant Judge, Kolhapur, whoGovindrao Ranoji Musale vs Sou. Anandibai And Anr. on 24 March, 1976 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1826361/ 1confirmed the decree and order passed by the learned trial Judge with a slight modification with which I am not concerned in this appeal. The present appeal is directed against the said judgment of the learned Assistant Judge. 3. As the arguments in this appeal turn, to a large extent, on some of the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act, which came into force on 18th May 1955, it may not be out of place to take notice of the same at this stage. Section 11 of this Act runs as follows: ""Any marriage solemnised after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Cls. (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5"". Section 5 lays down the conditions which have to be fulfilled in order that a marriage may be solemnised between any two Hindus. One of these conditions, as provided in Clause (i) of that section, is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. Sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, on which this case mainly turns, runs as follows: ""(1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Any may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent."" The material portion of Section 23 runs as follows: ""(1) In any proceeding under this Act, whether defended or not, if the Court is satisfied that--- (a)  any of the grounds for granting relief exists and the petitioner is not in any way taking advantage of his or her own wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief, and  (b)                         XX   XX  (c)  XX   XX (d)  there has not been any unnecessary or improper delay in instituting the proceeding, and  (e)   XX   XX then, and in such case, but not otherwise, the Court shall decree such relief accordingly.""Govindrao Ranoji Musale vs Sou. Anandibai And Anr. on 24 March, 1976 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1826361/ 24.  In the case before me, it is common ground that the marriage between the appellant and respondent No.1  was null and void in view of the provision of Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act as the condition imposed by Clause (i) of Section 5 thereof was not fulfilled.  The petition presented by respondent NO. 1 was for a decree declaring the marriage a nullity and for permanent alimony.  That decree has been passed and there is no challenge here to the decree in so far as it grants a declaration of mullet in respect of the marriage purported to have been gone through by the appellant with respondent NO. 1. The only challenge in this appeal is to that part of the decree which award maintenance by way of permanent alimony. 5. The first submission of Mr. Pendse learned counsel for the appellant, was that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely confers a remedy but does not confer any right and hence to obtain an order for permanent alimony respondent No. 1 must establish her right under some other provision of law. It was pointed out by Mr. Pendse that neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 can it be said that respondent No. 1 has any right, as the marriage between her and the appellant was null and void and hence she cannot take advantage of the remedy granted by Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In my view, this submission of Mr. Pendse must be rejected. In the first place, on a plain construction of the language used in sub-section (1) of the Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act it is clear that a description is granted to the Court exercising jurisdiction under the Act at the time of passing any decree or thereafter, on application made to t either by the wife or the husband, to order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such sum for her or his maintenance as set out therein. This power conferred upon the Court clearly creates a corresponding right in the wife or the husband to get maintenance provided the conditions laid down for the grant of the same are satisfied. It cannot, therefore, be said that Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act does not create any right at all. Secondly, it must be appreciated that a plain reading of this provision shows that it clearly contemplates that not only the wife but even the husband would in certain circumstance be entitled to get maintenance. Neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 is any right of maintenance given to the husband at all. Hence. if the submission of Mr. Pendse is accepted, it would mean that the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in so far as they deal with the claim of the husband for maintenance, would be redundant; and such a construction should not normally be resorted to. Thirdly, it must be remembered that the Hindu Marriage Act is a codifying Act. It is well settled that the object of codification of a particular branch of law is that on any matter specifically dealt with by it, the law should be sought for in the codifying enactment itself. In view of this, the better construction of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act seems to be that not only does it provide for a remedy but it also confers a right Finally, it must be remembered that the Act of 1956 came into force after the Hindu Marriage Act and hence it could not have been the object of Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act of create a remedy for the enforcement of a right subsequently created by the Act of 1956. 6. The next submission of Mr. Pendse was that if the provisions of sub-section (1) of S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are so construed as to entitle persons, who do not enjoy the status of a husband or wife, to get maintenance, such a construction would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of 1956 and in particular Section 18 thereof. It was pointed out by him that the Act of 1956 is a subsequent piece of legislation and under the provisions of Section 4(b) thereof any other law in force immediately before the commencement of that Act ceased to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in that Act. It was urged by Mr. Pendse that under Section 18 of the Act of 1956 the right to claim maintenance was given only to a lawfully weddedGovindrao Ranoji Musale vs Sou.

Krishna Sarbadhikary vs Alok Ranjan Sarbadhikary on 16 May, 1984 Equivalent citations: AIR 1985 Cal 431, 89 CWN 156 Author: C Mookerjee Bench: C Mookerjee, M G Mukherji JUDGMENT Chittatosh Mookerjee, J. 1. The principal question in this appeal is whether the learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Alipore was justified in dissolving the marriage of the appellant wife with the respondent husband on the ground that she had treated her husband with cruelty within the meaning of Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. On 12th December, 1976 the marriage of the parties took place according to Hindu rites at Baguihati, P. S. Rajarhat, District 24 Parganas. At the time of the marriage, the petitioner, husband (respondent herein) was aged about 36 years and the appellant wife was aged about 28 years. After marriage, they had lived at the husband's joint family residence at 27/1/1B, Jiban Krishna Mitra Road, P. S. Chitpur, District 24 Parganas. The petitioner husband's widqwed mother, his sister who had been divorced from her husband and his three brothers used to live with him. One brother subsequently died. Soon after her marriage, the appellant wife had conceived and on 9th October, 1967 in a nursing home, at North Calcutta, she had given birth to a daughter. During their married life the appellant, Krishna, on several occasions had left her husband's house and had stayed her father's house. According to the respondent husband, she used to depart without the consent or knowledge either of his mother or of himself. The appellant wife, however, denied the same and according to her, except on one occasion, with consent of her husband she used to visit her father's house. On the evening of 10th July, 1978, the appellant wife with her daughter left her husband's place and thereafter she did not return. There was some angry correspondence between the parties. On 14th May, 1979, the present respondent filed in the District Judge's Court, 24 Parganas a petition for dissolving the marriage on the ground of cruelty of his wife. She contested the case. As already stated, the learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Alipore has allowed the said petition and has passed a decree dissolving the marriage between the parties on the ground of cruelty. 3. Mr. Bankim Dutt learned advocate for the appellant, has submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant wife was guilty of legal cruelty and throughout their married life the appellant's behaviour towards her husband was what was expected of a Hindu wife and occasional differences of opinion between the two were part of normal wear and tear of married life. According to the learned advocate for the appellant, there was no proof that the alleged acts of the appellant had caused reasonable apprehension in the husband's mind that it would be harmful and injurious for him to live with her and, therefore, the Court below was wrong in holding that the appellant wife had treated her husband with cruelty. Further, submission on behalf of the appellant is that up to 10th July, 1978, the parties had admittedly lived as husband and wife and therefore the husband must be deemed to have condoned the alleged acts of cruelty on the part of his wife committed prior to 10th of July, 1978. Since 10th July, 1978 they have been living separately and they had only exchanged letters and there was neither any pleading nor proof that subsequent to 10th July, 1978 she had treated her husband with cruelty. The learned advocate for the appellant has further urgedSm. Krishna Sarbadhikary vs Alok Ranjan Sarbadhikary on 16 May, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1787285/ 1that even if the decree passed by the Court below is upheld, the appellant wife ought to be awarded permanent alimony. The learned advocate for the appellant has also submitted that appropriate order under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act ought to be made in respect of the appellant's properties lying in the house of her husband. 4. The petitioner husband who is the respondent in this appeal, in Paragraph 3 of his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, had pleaded that Smt Krishna, who is the respondent in the Court below, was extremely short-tempered, rude, eccentric, whimsical and discourteous and suffered from mental disorder resulting in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on her part. The petitioner husband further claimed that from the very night of the Phoolsajjya day on 14th December, 1976, she had become highly displeased with him and had expressed her extreme dissatisfaction about the gifts and presentations made to her from the petitioner's family. The husband's another allegation in his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was that after her marriage without his permission she used to otten visit and to stay for long duration at her father's house and she had to be brought back after good deal of persuation. Whenever the petitioner raised any protest against such frequent visit or stay, the respondent wife got annoyed, enraged and agitated and picked up quarrels with him and abused the petitioner and his family. The petitioner alleged that her mode of living and conduct had injured his mental feelings (vide Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the petition). The petitioner further pleaded that her wife had lodged a written complaint to the Officer-inCharge, Chitpur Police Station making false and unfounded charges of torture against him and the members of his family. On 19th October, 1977 she had given birth in a Nursing Home to a daughter and then she was taken back to her husband's house. Even thereafter she had gone back to her father's house and had to be brought back. On 10th July, 1978 she had finally left her husband's place with her baby without the consent and knowledge of the petitioner or his family. Thereafter, she had written him letters making false and defamatory allegations of torture and mal-treatment towards her. She had also demanded return of her ornaments and other presents made to her. 5. The present appellant in her written statement filed in the Court below had denied the aforesaid allegations of her husband. She averred that she was an obedient and submissive wife but she had been ill-treated by the petitioner's mother and his youngest sister, who were in the habit of picking up quarrels with her and used to oppress her in such a cruel way that it was impossible for her to stay in her husband's house. She claimed that in order to avoid further physical assaults and mental torture she had to leave her husband's house and had to take rest in her father's house (vide paragraph 7 of her written statement). She did not deny that she had lodged complaint with the police against her husband. But she alleged that her husband had thereafter taken her to Alipore Criminal Court and made her sign a blank paper which had been afterwards converted into an affidavit for using the same Tor the petitioner's gain. She further averred that because of apprehension of losing her life, she had returned back to her father's family. But she was ready to meet her marital obligations with the petitioner if he made provisions for separate residence for her and the baby. She also claimed return of ornaments, jewelleries, furniture, clothing and other articles given in the list annexed to her written statement.Sm. Krishna Sarbadhikary vs Alok Ranjan Sarbadhikary on 16 May, 1984 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1787285/ 26. We may proceed to examine whether the learned Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Alipore was justified in believing the petitioner husband's case of cruelty against his wife (the present appellant) and in granting the decree for divorce. Both in her pleading and in course of her evidence the appellant wife has admitted that she used to frequently leave her husband's place and stay at her father's house. Intermittently she returned to her husband's house. Since 10th July, 1978, she did not return at all to her husband's house. In our view, the learned Additional District Judge for very good reasons has accepted the petitioner husband's case that frequently the present appellant used to leave her husband's house without consent. This part of the petitioner husband's case has been proved by himself, his sister, Smt. Smritikana Sarvadhikari, P. W. 6, and his mother Smt. Sankurani Sarvadhikari, P.W. 3. According to these witnesses, Krishna often left their house without telling them anything. The Court below in this connection, has referred to a letter written by Krishna herself to her mother-in-law (Ext. 3(f)) and also to her mother's letter dated 14th February, 1977 (Ext. 3(e)) to the petitioner's mother. Both these letters referred to an incident at her husband's house on 8th February, 1977. Both of them tendered apologies for misbehaviour by her uncle, Durga Ghosh, who had taken her away to her father's house. Krishna in her letter (Ext. 3(f)) confessed that on the said date she had not been able to restrain herself and had misbehaved. Paramesh Ghosh, the father of the appellant, in his letter dated 15th August, 1977, addressed to Smt. Sankurani Sarvadhikari referred to another incident between her and her mother-in-law's family. He promised to take steps and stated that he was aware that her daughter was living happily in her husband's house. Paramesh craved apologies for being unable to personally meet Smt. Sankurani. The statement made by Smt. Krishna, the appellant, in course of her evidence given in the Court below that whenever she went to her father's house she took permission of her husband or mother-in-law is even inconsistent with not only some of the averments made in her written statement but also with other parts of her evidence. We have already mentioned that her case was that because of ill-treatment at her husband's house she was compelled to frequently come away and to stay in her father's house. In her evidence she had repeated some of these allegations against her husband and the members of his family. We have also mentioned that in paragraph 12 of her written statement Krishna had inter alia averred that unless proper security for her safety or arrangement for separate accommodation for herself and her child was made, she was unable to live with her husband. 7. The appellant's allegations against her husband, her mother-in-law and other members of their family have not been corroborated by any other witness or contemporaneous documentary evidence. Such corroboration is not required as an absolute rule of law. In proof of the matrimonial offence the Court insists upon corroborative evidence unless its absence is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Court (vide Bipin Chander v. Prabhabati, 1956 SCR 830). The Supreme Court in their later decision in Dastane v. Dastane, , held the word 'satisfied' in Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act means preponderance of probabilities and not satisfaction beyond doubt. In a Bengali family a newly married girl who still retains her close affinities with her own family generally confides in her mother as to how she has been received in her husband's house and about important incidents, if any, occurring in her husband's house. If she felt hurt in all probabilities she would have also written letters to her parents complaining ill-treatment meted out to her. Krishna, the appellant, during her cross-examination had stated that she had kept contacts with her parents through letters. We are not prepared to believe her statement that she had to write letters in the presence of her husband who used to post these letters. In the first place, such a case was neither pleaded nor any suggestionSm.

314,"Bombay High Court Rajeshbai And Ors. vs Shantabai on 28 April, 1981 Equivalent citations: AIR 1982 Bom 231, (1981) 83 BOMLR 327 Bench: Masodkar JUDGMENT 1. This appeal heard at some lenght raises , as is apparent, some intricate questions of law intermixed with problems of justice and fairrness , of legality and of humanity , technical and of substance. The controversy centres around the human relations that became recognised by ties of marriage. Its legal fallibility and consequential possibilities of avoidance of rights personal and of property. These problems arise this way. 2. Respondent Shantabai filed the present suit seeking reliefs of injunction against the defendents, the present appellants, restraining them from disturbing her present possession and enjoyment of the properties and , alternatively, also seeking relief of possession of the properties which may not be found to be in her possession . She also prayed for the partition of C. S. No. 372 and possession of one-third share therein . 3. These reliefs were so claimed on the basis that the plaintiff, Shantabai , was the lawfully married wife of deceased Sadashiv and , upon his death, was entitled to inherit all his properties which are described and set out in the schedules attached to the plaint . It is not in dispute that Dagadu and Mahadu (original defendents Nos 1 and 2) appellants Nos. 2 and 3 , are the two brothers of Sadashiv, all being sons of Bayaji. 4. The common defence of these apellants was one of denial of the title of the plaintiff and an assertion to the effect that as per the caste custom applicable to Maratha community of which the parties were members , during the lifetime of Sadashiv , the plantiff was divorced by him and thereafter, Sadashiv had taken Rajeshbai , appellant No.1 as his wife, who was till his death residing with him as his lawfull wife . As the plaintiff was the divorced wife , she was not entitled to any share or any right of possession to the properties of Sadashiv. According to the defence, Rajeshbai was married according to the Hindu religious rites applicable to the community on Nov. 26, 1963 at Nasik and as she was the only lawfully married wife and as such the widow of Sadashiv , she would be entitled to succeed to all the interest of Sadashiv to the exclusion of the divorced wife. 5. The factum of the custom, of divorce, as well as of the validity of the marriage of Rajeshbai in its turn were all denied by the plaintiff, the first wife of Sadashiv. 6. After trying the contentious question between the parties, the trial court found, upon evidence, that the custom was not established that there was no divorce given by Sadashiv to Shantabai , that, therefore, though Rajeshbai went through the form of Hindu marriage , her marriage was void and as a result of this , it was the plaintiff who , as the legally married wife and after her husband's death being his widow , was entitled to succeed to the interest and all the properties of Sadashiv. The trial court found that the properties were in possession of the defendants and therefore, made a decree directing the defendants to deliver possession of the properties described at serial Nos. 1 to 4 in theRajeshbai And Ors. vs Shantabai on 28 April, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1585145/ 1schedule attached to the plaint and further made a decree with regard to the one-third share in the house bearing C.S. No. 372 . That decree is under challenge in the present appeal. 7. During the course of the hearing of this appeal, Civil Application No. 1639 of 1981 was filed by the appellants' learned counsel raising alternate plea in defence as far as appellant No. 1 Rajeshbai is concerned and that is to the effect that in any case upon the finding that Rajeshbai having gone through the form of marriage and her marriage because of law being declared null and void and for no fault of her part, she would be entitled to the relief of maintenance against the admitted estate of her husband Sadashiv . That application was allowed as the same was not opposed. 8. Therefore in the appeal there is an additional issue at the behest of the appellants as to whether upon the finding that the marriage between Sadashiv and Reheshabai was void as the earlier marruage between Sadachiv and Shantabai was subsisting, Rajeshbai would or would not be entitled to the maintenance from and against the estate of Sadashiv. 9. An the contentions questions invoived in the present appeal were argued with considerable concern by the learned Counsel having regard to all the principles applicable to the controversy. 10. As far as the evidence and the factual findings, are concerned, It does not admit of any doubt that the parties belong to Maratha Patill community that would form part of the residuary class amonget ""the Marathas"". The other two being the five families and the 96 families (see S. 630 of the Hindu Law by Mulla). Once this finding is supportable, the residuary class would be more or less governed by the principles of customs applicable as such to the Shudas. There is the preponderance of the evidence spoken to by the witnesses examined for the defendants to the effect that in the community to which the parties belong there exists a long standing, well accepted and ever acted upon custom of divorce. The evidence of Dagadu (D. W. 1) is categorical on this aspect. His casts consciousness is exhibited as of other witnesses as he asserts that he himself and other are from maratha Patill community and are governed by customs as such. He states that the community has an extant custom of divorce based on mutual consent to be worked out at Caste Panchayats. The cross-examination of Dagadu does not affect the truth of these assertions. He has attended the caste panchayats for divorce right from 1935, Tanaji (D. W 2) is of 70 years of age. He is of the same community of Maratha. He too asserts that there is a custom of divorce. Waman (D. W 3) similarly, states that there exists a custom of divorce in similar terms. Arjun (D. W 4) who is aged 72 years, specks of customary divorces in the community in similar terms. Pandit (D. W. 6) had divorced his own wife according to the caste custom. Daulat (D. W 7) is related to Rajeshbal and is aged about 50 years. He also speaks of the caste custom. Chindha Lala Bachhav (D. W. 8) too in the cross-examination speaks of the custom in the community to have divorce, No doubt, the modality of the divorce spoken to by the witnesses is not uniform, but there is no uncertainty about their evidence on the aspect of existence of custom involving divorces by consent that is spoken to by all these persons is with regard to the divorce permitted and recognised in the community and they also speak about the instances of the divorces taken by the couples and acted upon and as such recongnised in the community. As against this, there is no evidence to show that there does not exist any such custom. Therefore it is apparent on the basis of the evidence that the findings recorded by the learned trial Judge that there is no custom is unsustailable. The evidence consistently shows thatRajeshbai And Ors. vs Shantabai on 28 April, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1585145/ 2by mutual consent and by calling the panchas customary divorce is extant. Minor variations in the testimony of these witnesses on the aspects of actual working out the customary divorces do not affect the prooof of the custom itself. 11. Now, once it is found that in the community to which Sadashiv, Shantabai and Rajeshbalbelonged, there could be customary divorce, the more important question is whether actually before Rajeshbai was married with Sadashiv there was in fact a divorce between Sadashiv and Shantabai. The trial Court has given the negative finding on this aspect and the evidence goes to show that finding is well-merited. The evidence does not carry any conviction at all that Shantabai was fuly divorced by Sadashiv according to the caste custom. On the other hand, Shantabai's evidence and the photographs procuced during the trial, and particularly at Ex. 130. Clearly go Shantabai on this aspect is preferable to the contrary evidence coming through the witnesses examined in support of the defence. According to Shantabai, as the was not getting the child, her mother-in-law suggested that Sadashiv should take a second wife and she (shantabai) agreed to that suggestion. She states that the never was divorced nor did she agree to put her thumb impression on a stamp paper which Sadashiv wanted her to give. She denies that any Caste Panchayat was held, She states that one notice was published by Sadashiv in ""Gavkari"" newspaper, but as soon as the notice came to her knowledge, she sent a reply throught her lawyer. Mr. Kotnis, and also published the same in newspaper asserting that there was no divorce. Sasashiv thereafter came and took her to his own house and they were all living together till he died, The photograph at Ex. 138 shows that she is sitting near the head of the dead body of Sadashiv and Rajeshbai is sitting behind her. According to her, Rajeshbai was just brought 2-3 years before his death and was not married at all. The undisputed and proved facts go to show that there is no writing that evidences any divorce. The evidence of the so-called panchas alleged to have been called for the purpose of giving divorce is far from satisfactory. As far as the documentary evidence shows, it is inconsistent with the fact of divorce. As soon as Sadashiv published the notice in the ""Gavkari"" newspaper. Shantabai denied the fact of divorce. Not only that, but there after at the time of the death of Sadashiv, she is very much seen sitting by the side of the head of the deceased Sadashiv. Her evidence on this aspect deserves to be accepted. 12. The evidence on record is indicative that though there is a caste custom under which the consenting parties cantake a divorce, it does not go further to establish that actually Shantabai consented to or was actually divorced by Sasashiv. Her marriage with Sadashiv, being not in dispute, continued till be died. 13. The evidence of Rajeshbai goes to show that she was taken in marriage by Sadashiv and all the forms and the rituals necessary for the marriage were gone through. So is the evidence of Daulat who states that Rajeshbai is his sister's daughter. He speaks about the marriage that was performed in the temple of Kala Ram by the Brahmin priest. He speaks about the sacrament of Saptapadi and Homa. This evidence can hardly be doubted. In fact, Rajeshbai is seen also in the photograph on which rellance is placed by the plaintiff herself. The plaintiff's assertion that she was brought without marriage does not appear to be true nor consistent. This during the lifetime and before the death of Sadashiv, be had married by going through the form of Hindu Marriage with Rajeshbai and till his death, Rajeshbai was residing with him.Rajeshbai And Ors. vs Shantabai on 28 April, 1981 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1585145/ 3",['27']

The following question has been referred to Division Bench in pursuance of the order of Narula J. :-- ""Whether an order refusing to stay the proceedings of a case under the Hindu Marriage Act under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure is appealable under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act or not""? 2. The facts giving rise to the above reference are that the appellant P.C. Jairath on getting a notice from his wife Mrs. Amrit Jairath respondent, filed a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights against the respondent in the District Court at Calcutta on 18th June, 1965. The respondent thereafter filed a petition under Sections 10 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act on 28th August, 1965 in the District Court at Delhi for judicial separation and payment of maintenance against the appellant. The appellant made an application dated 8th October, 1965 under Sections 10 and 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Delhi, to whom the petition for judicial separation and payment of maintenance had been allotted, for stay of the Delhi petition on the ground that his earlier petition for restitution of conjugal rights was pending in the District Court at Calcutta. According to the appellant the matter in issue in the two petitions in the District Court at Calcutta and the Delhi Court was substantially the same and as the proceeding at . Calcutta had been initiated earlier the proceedings in Delhi Court were liable to be stayed. The appellant's application for stay was resisted by the respondent and was dismissed by the learned Subordinate Judge 1st Class Delhi as per order dated 11th February, 1966. It was held that it was not a fit case in which the proceedings in the suit pending in the Delhi Court should be stayed under Section 10 or Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The husband then came to this Court in appeal against the above order of the trial Court refusing to stay the proceedings. 3. At the hearing of the appeal a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondent about the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that no appeal lay against the order under appeal. The learned Single Judge felt that the matter was of importance and not free from difficulty. Note was also made of the fact that divergent views had been expressed by the Courts. The matter was consequently referred to the Division Bench. 4. Before dealing with the respective contentions of the parties it would be pertinent to briefly refer to some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act having a bearing. Section 9 of the Act gives the circumstances under which a decree for restitution of conjugal rights may be awarded. Section 10 prescribes the grounds for a decree for judicial separation. Sections 11 and 12 enumerate theP.C. Jairath vs Mrs. Amrit Jairath on 22 July, 1966 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1968387/ 1grounds for granting a decree for nullity of marriage, while Section 13 reproduces the circumstances under which a marriage may be dissolved by a decree for divorce. Section 24 of the Act makes provision for an order by the Court to the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings and maintenance pendente lite is may seem to the Court to be reasonable. Section 23 empowers the Court to make an order for permanent alimony and maintenance. Under Section 26 of the Act the Court may from time to time pass orders in respect of the custody, maintenance and education of the minor children of the parties in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act. Order about the property presented, at or about the time of marriage, which may belong jointly to both the husband and wife, can be made by the Court under Section 27 of the Act. According to Section 21 of the Act, subject to the other provisions contained in the Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf, all proceedings under the Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code or Civil Procedure, 1908. Section 28, with which we are directly concerned, reads as under:-- ""All decrees and orders made by Court in any proceedings under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the Court made in me exercise of the original civil Jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force. Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of costs only."" 5. Mr. Bedi on behalf of the appellant has argued that Section 28, reproduced above, gives a right of appeal against all decrees and orders made by a Court in any proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act, and as the impugned order was made in the course of proceedings under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act the appellant has a right of appeal against that order. The impugned order, it is further contended, affected the jurisdiction of the Court to try the petition under Section 10, and as the order was made after hearing arguments and was not of a mere formal nature the appellant is entitled to assail the same by means or appeal. 6. As against the above Mr. Kirpal on behalf of the respondent has argued that the appealability of decrees and orders has to be determined by reference to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Whatever might be the position with respect to decrees and orders made under the specified provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, so far as the orders on applications under the Code of Civil Procedure are concerned, according to Mr. Kirpal, the right of appeal would only be there if it is provided by that Code. 7. It would at this stage be useful to advert to the authorities which have been cited at the bar. In Sunder Singh v. Manna Sunder Singh, AIR 1962 Punjab 127, Gosain, J. held that an order awarding maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings on a wife's application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is appealable under Section 28, of the Act. Argument was advanced before the learned Judge at the words ""under any law for the time being force"" show that every order is not made appealable and that reference has to be made to the Civil Procedure Code to find whether such an order is a decree as defined in the Code or whether such an order is made appealable under any provision of the Code of Civil Procedure. This contention was rejected and it was observed--P.C. Jairath vs Mrs. Amrit Jairath on 22 July, 1966 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1968387/ 2""It is difficult to conceive that the Legislature left the matter of maintainability of appeals on wholly uncertain grounds and that for finding whether a particular order under this Act was or was not appealable the Legislature intended to leave the parties to have recourse to the provisions of other laws."" Reliance was placed by Gosain, J. on Sobhana Sen v. Amar Kanta, AIR 1959 Cal 455, and Rukhmanibai v. Kishanlal Ramlal, AIR 1959 Madh Pra 187. Reference was also made to two single Bench cases of Lahore High Court R.C. Chamarette v. Mrs. P. E. Chamarette, AIR 1937 Lah 176, and Noble Millicans v. Mrs. G. Millicans, AIR 1937 Lah 862. The two Lahore cases were under the Divorce Act. In the case of R. C. Chamarette AIR 1937 Lah 176, question arose about the paternity of children in matrimonial proceedings. It was held that an order in that respect made by the Court could be appealed against under Section 55 of the Divorce Act, the provisions of which were analogous to those of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In the case of Noble Millicans, AIR 1937 Lah 862 it was held that an appeal lies from an order of the Court fixing the amount of maintenance under Section 41 of the Divorce Act. In AIR 1959 Cal 455 (supra) a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court held that an appeal lies against an order of the District Judge on an application by the wife for maintenance pendente lite and expenses of divorce proceedings started by the husband under the Hindu Marriage Act, Das Gupta J. as he then was, who spoke for the Bench, observed-- ""(5) The question before us is one of construction of the words used by the legislature in this section. Two rival constructions require consideration. One is that by this section the legislature has provided that an appeal will lie against all decrees and orders made by the court in any proceedings under the Act and that the forum and other matters in connection with the hearing of the appeal would be decided in accordance with the laws that may be in force for the time being. The other construction which is suggested is that this section does not say anything positive itself as regards appealability of decrees and orders but merely says that if an appeal lies against decrees and orders made in any proceedings under this Act under some law that may be in force at the time, then an appeal will lie and not otherwise. (6). In my opinion, the first construction should be preferred to the other construction that has been suggested. In the first place, it seems to me unreasonable to hold the legislature guilty of leaving the matter of appealability entirely at large, as it would be, if appealability was to depend on any law for the time being in force. It is much more reasonable in my opinion, to think that when the legislature took upon itself the task of making provisions as regards appeals, it intended to make definite provisions."" Similar view was expressed by the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in AIR 1959 Madh Pra 187 (supra). The above mentioned Calcutta and Madhya Pradesh authorities were also followed by Mahajan, J. in Dr. Tarlochan Singh v.

316,"Allahabad High Court Smt. Ram Pyari vs Dharam Das And Ors. on 28 September, 1983 Equivalent citations: AIR 1984 All 147 Author: K Agrawal Bench: K Agrawal, O Saxena JUDGMENT K.C. Agrawal, J. 1. Dissenting with a decision reported in Smt. Sheelwati v. Smt. Ram Nandani (AIR 1981 All 42), Hon'ble B. N. Sapru, J. has referred the following question: ""Whether the view taken in Smt. Sheelwati v. Smt. Ram Nandani (AIR 1981 Allahabad 42) is correct in so far as it lays down that the validity of a void marriage being in contravention of the provisions of Setcion 5 (i) read with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be gone into at the instance of a third aggrieved party after the death of the spouses to the marriage."" 2. The relevant facts which led to the above reference have been noted by the learned Judge in his judgment. It appears that Smt. Ram Pyari, the appellant, moved an application for grant of a succession certificate before the District Judge, Kumaun to the assets of her husband Tula Ram. It was alleged that the applicant Smt Ram Pyari was married to Tula Ram and that he having died without leaving any issue, she was entitled to the succession certificate. 3. The objectors, who were kith and kin of Tula Ram, pleaded that Smt. Ram Pyari was not the legally wedded wife of Tula Ram and she was not entitled to the grant of the succession certificate. The learned District Judge rejected the application on April 10, 1973, Against that judgment the present appeal was filed. 4. Challenging the judgment of the learned District Judge, the appellant's learned counsel argued that in the proceeding for the grant of a succession certificate consequent on the death of Tula Ram, the validity of marriage of Tula Ram with Smt. Ram Pyari could not be questioned. The submission was that a marriage on the ground of breach of Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act can be set aside only at the instance of one of the spouses and if no application for declaration of the marriage is made by either of the spouses, the marriage becomes immune from challenge. For this submission reliance had been placed on the decision of Smt. Sheelwati v. Smt. Ram Nandani (AIR 1981 All 42) (supra) in which the learned Judge held that no third person can treat the marriage to be void and as such it cannot be so adjudicated in any suit or proceeding. Hon'ble B. N, Sapru, J., held doubtful about the correctness of the view taken in this case. 5. A brief re'sume' of the relevant provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would show that Section 5(i) lays down that the marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if neither party has a spouse at the time of the marriage. This section had been introduced by the Parliament with a view to prohibit bigamy. Before enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act there was no such prohibition in the pure Hindu Law. Section 11 of the Act provides that a marriage between any two Hindus, if it contravenes the conditions specified in Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 and if it is solemnized after the commencement of the Act, the same shall be null and void.Smt. Ram Pyari vs Dharam Das And Ors. on 28 September, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/273089/ 1Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with voidable marriages whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act. It provides that a voidable marriage may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the grounds mentioned in this provision. What is Important at this place to note is that a voidable marriage can be annulled by a decree of nullity only when an application to that effect is moved under the Act by one of the parties to the marriage. Section 27 further provides that any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of the Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living and the provisions of Sections 494 and 495 of the Penal Code shall apply accordingly. In other words, this section imposes punishment for the offence of bigamy. Section 19 deals with the Court to which petitions contemplated by Hindu Marriage Act can be moved. 6. Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act was amended in 1976 on the recommendation of the Law Commission. By this amendment the Parliament has put an end to the controversy with a petition seeking a decree for nullity of marriage could only be filed during the lifetime of the spouse or even after his/ her death. By inserting the words 'against the other party' in Section 11 it has been made apparent that a petition for decree cf nullity of a marriage may be presented only during the lifetime of the spouse. 7. Under Section 11 of the Act any marriage solemnized after the commence-ment of the Hindu Marriage Act can be declared null and void on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant was that as Section 11 is exhaustive, the right to get the marriage performed against Section 5 Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) is limited to the parties to a marriage and that a third person cannot bring any suit for its declaration as a nullity. There is no doubt that the phrase 'either party thereto' can only mean to person, name-ly, the actual parties to the marriage and no third party. According to the language of this section even the first wife cannot apply under Section 11 for declaration of the second marriage as void but there is nothing in Section 11 or in any provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act which debars a person affected by the illegal marriage performed in contravention of Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 to file a suit in the Civil Court for its declaration as void. There is a presumption against exclusion of jurisdiction and it cannot be easily inferred. There is inherent right in every person to bring a suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute, one may at one's peril bring a suit of one's choice. A suit for its maintainability requires no authority in law. It is enough no statute debars the suit (see Ganga Bai v. Vijai Kumar (AIR 1974 SC 1126). Accordingly not only the first wife but also anyone who is affected by the marriage performed in contravention of Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 of Hindu Marriage Act would be entitled to bring the civil suit. 8. The controversy about maintainability of a civil suit at the instance of a third person in a Civil Court has been considered by this Court and others. The decision of this Court is reported in Dr. Jokhan Prasad Shukla v. Laxmi Devi (1974 All LJ 130). It was hold in this case that a suit filed by the first wife for declaration of the marriage between her husband with another lady to be null and void is not covered by the provisions of Section 11 of the Act and, therefore, she has the ordinary remedy under the civil law of filing a suit for declaration of the second marriage to be void. In Har Mohan v. Kamla Kumari (AIR 1979 Orissa 51) the suit filed by the first wife for declaration of the marriage ofSmt. Ram Pyari vs Dharam Das And Ors. on 28 September, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/273089/ 2her husband with another woman was held to be maintainable. In T. Rangaswami v. T. Aravindammal (AIR 1957 Mad 243). Ramaswami J. (as he then was) observed: ""Whereas.....in the case of a voidable marriage it can be annulled only on presentation of a petition by either party thereto, a marriage which is null and void may be declared to be so even at the instance of a stranger whose interest is affected by such marriage."" 9. In AIR 1963 Patna 311, it was held that it was clear from the scheme of the Hindu Marriage Act that a party to the marriage in respect of which no decree for nullity could be granted under the Hindu Marriage Act, could seek his remedy under the general law. To the same effect is the view taken in Shan-karappa v. Basamma (AIR 1964 Mys 247). 10. There are few other cases on this controversy but as no useful purpose could be served by multiplying the number, we do not consider it necessary to refer them. 11. At this place it appears relevant to refer to the distinction between a void and voidable marriage. We have noted above that Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with the cases where a marriage is void at the option of either party thereto. Its object is to lay down that until avoided, a voidable marriage should be regarded as good for all purposes. It also lays down the circumstances under which a marriage shall be held to be voidable and annulled by a decree of nullity. Sections 11 and 17 deal with void marriages. Under section 17 a person committing breach of Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act is liable to be punished under Sections 494 and 495 of the Penal Code. It is true that the two sections deal with and lay down that the marriages performed in contravention of the clauses referred to above would be void but it will be a folly to think that the legislature has enacted two provisions for the same purpose. Section 11 simply declares a marriage to be void whereas Section 17 makes a party contravening Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 liable to punishment. These two sections, however, cannot be read as confining the rights only of the parties to a void marriage, There is a distinction between a void and voidable marriage. A void marriage is one which is regarded as non-existent or as never having taken place. It could be so treated by both the parties to it without the existence of any decree annulling the said marriage. A marriage is void where there is bigamy, consanguinity or within the degrees of prohibited relationship. In these cases the Court will regard the marriage as never having taken place and no status of matrimony as ever having been conferred. Consequently, the parties never having been husband and wife, either is competent to be called against the other. Consent of the parties performing the marriage in breach of Clause (i) of Section 5 cannot validate it. Such is not the position in case of a voidable marriage. A voidable marriage is regarded as valid and subsisting unless a competent Court annuls it. Until the decree of nullity is obtained in accordance with Hindu Marriage Act. the lie remains binding. So long as there is no decree they will live and die as married persons with all the incidents that attach to that estate. The expression 'void means null, ineffectual having no force or binding effect. Since a marriage performed in contravention of Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 is void, it is incapable of being cured or ratified.Smt.

J. Jagannadha Raju, J. 1. This second appeal has been referred to a pivision Bench as per order dated 26-7-1988 passed by our learned brother Justice G. Ramanujulu Naidu. The order of reference reads as follows : ""The question raised in the second appeal is whether the illegitimate children of a person can be equated with his natural sons and treated as coparceners for the purpose of claiming a share in their joint family property? In other words the scope of S. 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act as amended in 1976 falls for consideration. The question is one of general importance and in the absence of any decision of this court, an authoritative pronouncement on the question by a Division Bench of this court is desirable. I therefore refer this second appeal for decision by a Division Bench of this court. Place the papers before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for appropriate order."" 2. Before we deal with the legal questions that arise for consideration in the second appeal, it would be just and proper to set out, in brief, the facts leading to the present second appeal. 3. The plaintiffs, the appellants in the second appeal filed a suit O. S. No. 105 of 1981 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Kothagudem for partition of the plaint schedule properties into six equal shares and allotment of one such share each to plaintiffs 1 and 2, defendants 1 to 3, and to allot the remaining 1/6th share equally among the plaintiffs and the four defendants. The plaintiffs claim that third plaintiff Rosamma and the fourth defendant Boosamma are the two wives of late Rasala Ramaiah and that Ramaiah married third plaintiff in 1951 and that the plaintiffs are the legitimate sons of Ramaiah born to third plaintiff. They claim that the marriage of their mother took place in 1951 at Bhadrachalam. D.1 to D.3 are the children of Ramaiah through D.4. They claim that as they are all members of a Hindu joint family, plaintiffs 1 and 2 are entitled to seek partition and they are entitled to equal share along with the defendants 1 and 2. it is claimed that plaintiffs are each entitled to a one-sixth share plus 1 /42nd share whereas the third plaintiff and fourth defendant, the widows of Ramaiah, are entitled to 1/42 nd share each. As defendants did not effect a partition in spite of demands, a registered notice was issued and then the suit for partition was filed. 4. The defendants resisted the suit claiming that Rasala Ramaiah never married the third plaintiff and she is not the second wife of Ramaiah. She belongs to a different community, namely, Goldsmith, while Ramaiah is Yadava by caste. Plaintiffs are not the children of Ramaiah. They are not entitled to any share. In the proceedings under the Land Ceilings Act, Ramaiah filed a declaration in C.C. No. 457 of 1975 showing only defendants 1 to 3 as his children and the fourth defendant as his wife. They claim that plaintiff No. 3 is a debaucherous lady and it is not known through whom she begot plaintiffs 1 and 2. After death of Ramaiah, when she claimed that she is the wife of Ramaiah and that plaintiffs 1 and 2 are the children of Ramaiah, to avoid litigation and at theRasala Surya Prakasarao And ... vs Rasala Venkateswararao And ... on 21 February, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/222626/ 1instance of the elders of the village, two acres of land in Survey No. 152 was given to the plaintiffs in full settlement of their claims. In that connection, a document was also executed on 12-8-1977. Plaintiffs are not entitled to claim partition. They have no rights in the property of Ramaiah. Even otherwise, they are estopped from claiming any rights in the property of Ramaiah in view of the prior settlement which took place on 12-8-1977. 5. The trial court recorded the following findings : that a marriage did take place between plaintiff No. 3 and Ramaiah but the marriage is not valid as the necessary rituals and ceremonies were not observed nor performed plaintiff No. 3 lived with Ramaiah; she can be considered to be the exclusively kept concubine of Ramaiah and that plaintiffs 1 and 2 are the illegitimate children born to plaintiff No. 3 through Ramaiah. Considering the effect of S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the court held that plaintiffs 1 and 2, who are children of an invalid marriage, should be treated as legitimate children of Ramaiah for all practical purposes. It also held that plaintiff No. 3 is not entitled to claim a share, but she is entitled to maintenance against the share of Ramaiah. If further held that as defendants 1 to 3 are the natural sons of Ramaiah and as they are members of Hindu joint family, each of them is entitled to a 1/4th share and the 1/4th share in the family properties which belongs to Ramaiah devolved upon plaintiffs 1 and 2 and defendants 1 to 4 and each of them is thus entitled to a l/24th share. The court further held that though there is some evidence of tentative arrangement of two acres of land being given to the plaintiffs, it does not estop the plaintiffs from claiming a share in the suit properties. The court directed partition of the plaint schedule properties into 24 equal shares and for allotment of one such share each to plaintiffs 1 and 2. It recognised the claim of plaintiff No. 3 for maintenance against the share of her husband late Ramaiah. 6. Aggrieved by the above judgment, the plaintiffs filed A. S. No. 52 of 1984 on the file of the District Judge, Khammam. The District Judge came to the conclusion that the third plaintiff is not the legally wedded wife of late Rasala Ramaiah and that plaintiffs 1 and 2, who are born to third plaintiff through Ramaiah, are to be treated as legitimate children of Ramaiah by virtue of S. 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The appellate court further held that plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree as prayed for in the plaint and that plaintiffs 1 and 2 are entitled to 1/24th share each and the third plaintiff is entitled to maintenance against the share of her husband late Ramaiah. 7. In this appeal, Sri P. V. R. Sharma, appearing for the appellants contends that S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, especially after its amendment in 1976, has removed the disqualifications attached to illegitimate children, both for purposes of status as well as for succession. As the parties are Sudras, relying upon various decisions which dealt with the rights of illegitimate sons of a Sudra, he argued that even prior to the Hindu Marriage Act, under the Shastraic and textual Hindu law, the illegitimate son of a Sudra is entitled to claim a partition after the death of the father. Originally, he was entitled to a half share compared to the share of the legitimate son. By virtue of S. 16(1) or S. 16(3), now the distinction between the illegitimate son and the legitimate son is completely wiped out. Now the settled legal position is that so long as the father is alive, the illegitimate son cannot force a partition, but subsequent to the death of the father, the illegitimate son is certainly entitled to seek partition of the property and that he is entitled to parity of treatment with the legitimate son. Mr. Sharma contends that the illegiimate son becomes a coparcener along with the legitimate sonRasala Surya Prakasarao And ... vs Rasala Venkateswararao And ... on 21 February, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/222626/ 2and he also gets rights of survivorship as a coparcener. Mr, Sharma contends that the disqualifications attached to an illegitimate son of a Sudra have been removed gradually by virtue of legislative changes. The old S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act conferred the status of legitimacy whenever the court declares that the marriage is void or a nullity. By virtue of the amendment in 1976, that right has been extended to children of marriages which are not declared as void or a nullity by a decree of the court. In the present case, as both the courts found that a marriage did take place between Rasala Ramaiah and the third plaintiff and as that marriage is found to be invalid, plaintiffs 1 and 2 are completely protected by S. 16(1) and S. 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act and they are entitled to parity of treatment with legitimate sons, namely, defendants 1 to 3. In effect, S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it now stands, enlarges the rights of illegitimate son of a Sudra. 8. Sri S. C. Rangappa, appearing for the respondent-defendants, contends that both the courts held that there is no proof of marriage and as parties to the marriage belong to different castes, S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act has no application to the present plaintiffs and plaintiffs can only claim rights as illegitimate children born to a concubine. They cannot claim rights as children of a wife whose marriage with Ramaiah is a nullity or void. He also contends that as Ramaiah died in 1975 in an undivided status and as the property is the ancestral property, there is no question of his illegitimate children being entitled to a share in the properties. He places strong reliance on a catena of decisions and relies very strongly on the law laid down by the Madras High Court in Sivagnana Vadivu Nachiar v. Krishna Kanthan, ILR 1977 Mad 216 : (1976) 89 Mad LW 706. Mr. Rangappa contends that cases of children born to concubines stand on a different footing and plaintiffs 1 and 2 are not entitled to seek partition. 9. The crucial question for consideration in this appeal is whether plaintiffs 1 and 2 are entitled to the benefit of S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act as amended in 1976 and whether plaintiffs 1 and 2 are entitled to claim partition of the properties of their late father Rasala Ramaiah who died in 1975? If they are entitled to claim partition, what is the share to which each of the plaintiffs 1 and 2 are entitled? 10. To answer the question referred to the Division Bench, we have to consider the legal position relating to the rights of an illegitimate son of a Sudra at different points of time. The first stage would be the legal position as per the Shastraic and textual Hindu law and how it was understood and interpreted by courts prior to the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. The second stage is the law after the advent of S. 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The third stage is the legal position emerging as a result of amendment of S. 16 in the year 1976. 11. As both the courts have recorded concurrent findings of fact regarding the factum of a marriage taking place between Rasala Ramaiah and third plaintiff and as both the courts have held that the marriage is invalid for want of non-observance of the necessary rituals and ceremonies, it is not necessary for this court to go into that question. Both the courts have concurrently found that plaintiff No. 3 lived as the exclusively kept concubine of Ramaiah and plaintiffs I and 2 were born to plaintiff No. 3 through Ramaiah. On the settled facts, what is the legal position is the only question that will have to be considered by us.Rasala Surya Prakasarao And ... vs Rasala Venkateswararao And ... on 21 February, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/222626/ 3",['13-A']

Hanumanthu Bench: P V Reddi, K S Shrivastav, A Hanumanthu ORDER A. Hanumanthu, J 1. The legal point involved in this appeal is whether a Hindu Woman who is married, after coming into force the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter called as 'Act'), to a Hindu male having a living lawfully wedded wife, can maintain a claim for maintenance under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter called as 'Maintenance Act1). 2. Having disagreed with the view expressed by a single Judge of this Court in C. Obuta Konda Reddy v. Pedda Venkala Lakshmamma, , that the 'Hindu wife' contemplated by Section 18 of the Maintenance Act means, a Hindu wife whose marriage is solemnized, though void under the Hindu Marriage Act, she is entitled to claim maintenance from the husband, our learned brother Ramesh Madhav Bapat-i made this reference to lay down the correct position of law to the Division Bench/Full Bench/Larger Bench. This is how this appeal has come up before this Full Bench. 3. In the reference order, our learned brother has narrated the facts leading to filing of this appeal and briefly stated, they are as under : The appellant herein is the defendant and the respondent herein is the plaintiff in O.S. No.131 of 1987 on the file of the Principal Subordinate Judge, Chittoor. The respondent-plaintiff filed the said suit informa pauperis claiming maintenance from the appellant at the rate of Rs.1,000/- per month and Rs.13,000/- towards the cost of gold chain and other ornaments gifted to her by her father at the time of her marriage with the appellant herein, and also to create a charge over the 'B' schedule property for the amount that may be decreed against the appellant-defendant. The case of the respondent-plaintiff is that the appellant married her according to Hindu rites and customs on 1-7- 1984 in Kasi Vishwanada Svvami Devasthanam, Palamaner, that the marriage was also registered before the Sub-Registrar, Palamaner on 7-11-1984, that after consummation of the marriage in the plaintiffs parents' house, she was taken by the appellant to his village and there she came to know that the appellant was already married to one Parvathamma who begot two daughters through him and the said two daughters were already married and that the first wife Parvathamma was residing in the appellant's house in the village. It was also her case that during the negotiations for her marriage, the appellant did not inform the respondent and her parents that he was already married and his first wife was living and that the plaintiff was made to believe as if it was his first marriage. It was also the case of the plaintiff that she reconciled herself on the advice of the elders and lived with him discharging her conjugal responsibilities till the middle of 1985 and that differences arose between the plaintiff and the defendant's first wife Parvathamma and on the instigation of the first wife, the appellant began to ill-treat her and neglected to maintain her and beat her on two or three occasions and drove her out of the house on 30-12-1985 after snatching away gold chain worth Rs. 13,0007- which was presented to her at the time of her marriage by her father, and that the plaintiff returned to her parents and since then she is residing with them. It is also the case of the plaintiffAbbayolla M. Subba Reddy vs Padmamma on 27 July, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19292/ 1that she would not have agreed to marry the appellant if he had divulged the fact that he was a married man having his first wife living. The plaintiff filed the said suit for the reliefs stated supra. The plaintiff also contended that the appellant gets an annual income of Rs.20,000/- from his agricultural lands, that he has money lending business and that the plaintiff does not have separate property or any independent source of income and that the plaintiff is entitled to get maintenance from the defendant who is her husband. 4. The appellant-defendant resisted the claim of the respondent-plaintiff. He categorically disputed the allegation that he married the plaintiff. He also pleaded that his first wife was living and that he has got two married daughters and that he has no reason to marry the plaintiff. He also denied the income as alleged in the plaint. The defendant also pleaded that the plaintiff is living in adultery and that she is not entitled to claim maintenance. 5. The trial Court settled the necessary issues and allowed the parties to lead the evidence. The respondent-plaintiff examined PWs.l to 5 and marked Exs. A-l A-2, A- 2(a) and A-2(b). The appellant-defendant examined DWs.l to 3, but no documents were marked on his behalf. The first wife of the defendant was examined as DW-2 and she deposed with regard to her marriage with defendant and begetting two daughters through him. She also denied the marriage of the plaintiff with the defendant. The trial Judge on a consideration of the oral and documentary evidence placed before him, held that the solemnization of the marriage of the plaintiff with the defendant has been established, and as such, she is the legally wedded wife of the defendant and that the defendant neglected to maintain her without any reason and that the defendant snatched away the gold chain, and other ornaments of the plaintiff. The learned trial Judge relying on the decision in , held that the plaintiff is entitled to claim maintenance under Section 18(2) of Maintenance Act. Hence, the plaintiff's suit has been decreed as prayed for, but without costs. Aggrieved of that judgment and decree, the defendant has preferred the appeal. 6. It may be stated here, as a fact, that the plaintiff examined as PW-1 stated in her cross- examination thus: ""It is true that I became pregnant about one and half years after I filed this suit. The defendant used to visit my house. It is not true to suggest that I did not (sic) become pregnant through somebody else."" The father of the plaintiff examined as PW2 stated in his cross-examination thus: ""The defendant used to visit our house for about 6 months now and then after he drove away PW1. He was coming even for one year after he drove away PW1."" This evidence of PWs.1 and 2 is also relevant in the light of the plea taken by the defendant that the plaintiff is living in adultery. The trial Judge has not considered this aspect. 7. The learned Counsel Sri S.Abbayolla M. Subba Reddy vs Padmamma on 27 July, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19292/ 2Ramamitrthy Reddy appearing for the appellant-defendant raised the sole contention that the alleged marriage of the appellant with the respondent even if it is admitted to have been solemnized, is null and void in view of the provisions of Section 5 read with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act and such a marriage, therefore, cannot confer status of a wife on the respondent-plaintiff which would entitle her to make a claim for maintenance under Section 18 of the Maintenance Act. He further elaborates that in order that a woman is entitled to claim maintenance under the said provision, she must satisfy the Court that she is the 'legally wedded wife' and a woman whose marriage contravenes the provisions of Section 5 read with Section II of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot claim the status of a 'wife' and the mere fact that necessary ceremonies of a marriage under the customary Hindu Law have been gone into, cannot confer on her the status of a ""legally wedded wife"" which is a condition precedent for claiming maintenance under Section 18 of the Maintenance Act. The learned Counsel further submitted that a marriage if void ab initio does not alter or affect the status of parties and does not create between them any rights and obligations which must normally arise from a valid marriage. 8. On the other hand, Sri C. Pattahhi Rama Rao, appearing for the respondent-wife raised the following contentions: (i) The Maintenance Act does not define ""Hindu Wife"" and sub- section (1) of Section 18 says that a ""Hindu Wife"" married either before or after the commencement of the Act shall be maintained by her husband and subsection (2)(d) of Section 18 says that a ""Hindu wife"" shall be entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim for maintenance if he has any other wife living and reading of the two subsections together, a ""Hindu wife"" whether married cither before or after the commencement of the Act is entitled to live separately from her husband without forfeiting her claim for maintenance if he has any other wife living and as the first wife of the appellant-defendant is living, the respondent-plaintiff is entitled to live separately and claim maintenance from her husband, the appellant herein. (ii) Section 18 of the Maintenance Act confers a statutory right of maintenance on every wife irrespective of her marriage being legal or void and there is no valid reason to restrict the application of such right only to a legally wedded wife. (iii) All that a wife has to establish in such a case is that her marriage was performed after going through the necessary ceremonies as per the customary Hindu Law and once that is established, it would not make any difference whether her marriage with the appellant contravenes Sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. (iv) The marriage of the respondent with the appellant is a voidable marriage under Section 12 of the Marriage Act as the appellant suppressed the feet that he was already married and his first wife is living and suppression amounts to playing fraud on the respondent and her father and if that feet had been divulged by the appellant to the respondent, the latter would not have agreed to marry him and therefore, the marriage is voidable under Section 12 of the Act and as no steps were taken eitherAbbayolla M.

319,"Bombay High Court Bajirao Raghoba Tambre vs Tolanbai (Miss) D/O Bhagwan Toge ... on 1 March, 1979 Equivalent citations: 1980 CriLJ 473 Author: P Shah Bench: P Shah, M Kanade JUDGMENT P.S. Shah, J. 1. This petition file d by the petitioner husband under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and also under section 462 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, raises a question of some importance. The question that arises for consideration is ""whether the second wife whose marriage is void in view of the provisions of sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Act No. 25 of 1955) is entitled to apply for maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973"". 2. The facts which are no longer in dispute before us are in a narrow compass. The petitioner is married to one Dwarkabai on July 4, 1961. During the subsistence of this marriage, the petitioner married the respondent No. 1 Tolanbai on September 5, 1966. On September 1, 1975. Tolanbai filed an application under section 125 of the Code alleging inter alia that the petitioner beat her and drove her out of the house and, therefore, she has been staying with her parents who are poor, and she has no means of livelihood. She claimed an amount of Rs. 500/- per month by way of maintenance. Apart from denying the allegations of the respondent, the petitioner contended in the trial Court that his marriage with the respondent even if proved was null and void and did not confer a status of the wife on her because this marriage was admittedly solemnised when his first wife Dwarkabai was living. 3. The trial Court held that the petitioner's marriage with Dwarkabai had taken place in the year 1961 while his marriage with the respondent had taken place in the year 1966. It also held that having regard to the fact that the necessary ceremonies for solemnisation of the marriage according to customary Hindu Law having been gone into, she must be deemed to be a legally wedded wife for the purposes of section 125 of the Code. On merits the trial Court accepted the case of the respondent and awarded maintenance at the rate of Rs. 60/- p.m. Aggrieved by this decision, both the petitioner and the respondent filed revision applications in the Sessions Court which came to be dismissed with the result that the order or maintenance passed by the trial Court was maintained. The petitioner has, therefore, preferred this present challenging the order of the courts below. 4. Mr. Sawant, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner husband raised only one contention. He submitted that the marriage of the respondent with the petitioner is null and void in view of the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and such a marriage, therefore, cannot confer the status of wife on the respondent which would entitle her to make an application for maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submitted that in order that a woman may be entitled to claim maintenance under the said provisions, she must satisfy the conditions laid down in that section, one of the conditions being that she is the wife of the person against whom maintenance is claimed. According to him, the word ""wife"" in section 125 must mean, and has all along been construed to mean under section 488 of the old Code of CriminalBajirao Raghoba Tambre vs Tolanbai (Miss) D/O Bhagwan Toge ... on 1 March, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113129/ 1Procedure, ""a legally wedded wife"", and as such a woman whose marriage contravenes the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act being void cannot claim the status of a wife. The mere fact that the necessary ceremonies of a marriage under the customary Hindu Law have been gone into cannot confer on her the status of ""a legally wedded wife' which is a condition precedent for claiming maintenance under section 125 of the Code. 5. On the other hand, Mr. Gavneker, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent sought to repeal these arguments of Mr. Sawant by contending that the provisions of section 125 should be liberally construed having regard to the social changes as well as the changes in the personal law of the party since independence. He submitted that although under the provisions of section 488 of the old Code which is in pari materia with the provisions of section 125 of the new Code, it has been consistently held that in order to be entitled to claim maintenance under section 488, the applicant must establish that she is the legally wedded wife. Such a narrow construction of the provisions will no longer be permissible having regard to the progressive measures to ameliorate the conditions of married women under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, and the extension of rights of maintenance to additional categories of persons who did not have such a right under the old sections 488 of the Code. He submitted that it must be assumed that the Parliament did taken into consideration the changes in the personal law while enacting the provisions of section 125 of the new Code. According to him, the provisions contained in the Hindu Marriage Act for alimony even to such a wife must be presumed to have been taken note of while enacting section 125 of the Code. He further submitted that section 125 of the Code confers a statutory right on every wife irrespective of her marriage being legal or void and there is no valid reason restrict its application only to a legally wedded wife. It was submitted that the provisions of section 125 were a piece of beneficial and social legislation which must be liberally construed in the context of the social changes and the intention of the legislature to confer additional rights on woman and children. The Counsel further submitted that all that the respondent had to establish in this case is whether the marriage was performed by going through the necessary ceremonies as per the customary Hindu Law, and, once that is established, it would not make any difference whether her marriage with the petitioner contravenes the provisions of sections 5 & 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Lastly he submitted that in any event, having regard to the fact of this case, this Court should not exercise its discretionary powers under Article 227 of the Constitution. 6. It is not disputed before us that the requisite ceremonies for a valid marriage under the personal law of the parties have been gone into in this case, although the marriage is null and void by reason of the provisions of sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This Act was passed with the object of amending and modifying the law relating to marriages among Hindus. Under the customary law, there was no restriction for a male Hindu to marry more than one women. This right of the Hindu husband under the customary Hindu Law was curtailed for the first time in the then Bombay Province by enacting the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriage Act, 1946, provisions whereof declared bigamy to be illegal. Under the provisions of the said Act and other similar laws enacted by other Provincial Legislatures, a second marriage by a Hindu person during the life time of the spouse was declared illegal and going through such a marriage was made penal. Consistent with the object of codifying the marriage laws amongst Hindus, all these State laws were repealed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for theBajirao Raghoba Tambre vs Tolanbai (Miss) D/O Bhagwan Toge ... on 1 March, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113129/ 2conditions for solemnisation of marriage between any two Hindus. Section 11 declares that a marriage solemnised after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void if it contravenes any of conditions specified in Clause (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5. One of the conditions for a marriage as required by section 5 is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage, and this is condition No. (i) in section 5. Section 11 also gives a remedy to either party to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration by a decree of nullity of marriage on any one of the said three conditions of section 5 being shown to the have been contravened. Obviously, the second marriage in such circumstances being void, it cannot create a legal status of husband and wife between the parties. It is true that section 11 also gives a right to the parties to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration of nullity by a decree of the Court , but the filing of the petition or passing the decree is not a condition precedent for putting an end to the marriage. What ultimately is declared on such a petition is nothing but the status of the party as on the date of the marriage, and therefore, the marriage does not continue to remain valid until a decree is passed. What is null and void cannot be deemed to be in existence for any purposes whatsoever. Under the circumstances, if a marriage is solemnised in contravention of any of the said three conditions referred to in section 5(i), the woman cannot get the status of the wife nor the male gets the status of a husband qua her. The second marriage does not continue to be valid till the passing of the decree for a nullity. The position is also clear from the fact that bigamy is made penal by section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides that any marriage between two Hindu solemnised after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living and the provisions of sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly. The position is made further clear from the anxiety of the legislature to protect children of such a marriage by providing in section 16 that not withstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. However, the rights of such a child are somewhat curtailed in the matter of inheritance to the property, because sub-section (3) of section 16 says that a child of such a marriage would not be entitled to any rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Having regard to all these provisions, the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent was void ab initio and the respondent could not get the status of a legally wedded wife inspite of the solemnisation of the marriage under the Hindu Law having gone into. Indeed, Mr. Gavnekar did not dispute this legal position. He, however, contended that the provisions of section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act conferred a right of maintenance on the second wife and the word ""wife"" in section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to be given a wider meaning as including a Hindu wife whose marriage may be otherwise void. 7. Before adverting to the consideration of section 125 of the new Code it would be of relevance to consider the legal position as it obtained prior to the enactment of the new code of 1973. Section 488 of the old Criminal Procedure Code inter alia provided that if any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his wife or his legitimate or illegitimate child unable to maintain itself, the Magistrate could make an order against such a person to make monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife or such child.

The controversy in this appeal is limited and revolved around the prayer of the respondent-wife for an order under section 27 of the Hindu marriage Act (hereafter the Act) in respect of the property held by the wife. So far as the other matrimonial disputes between the parties are concerned, they stand settled and are not the subject matter of an issue before us in this appeal The background in which the dispute relating to the grant of relief under section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act arose, need a notice at this stage. There were matrimonial proceedings between the parties The respondent - wife had instituted proceedings in the City Civil Court at Bombay for a decree of judicial separation as also for grant of maintenance. She also claimed relief under section 27 of the Act in respect her jewellery and other property. The appellant - husband had filed a petition seeking a decree of divorce on the ground ofBalkrishna Ramchandra Kadam vs Sangeeta Balkrishna Kadam on 4 September, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1716222/ 1cruelty. Both those proceedings were disposed of by a common judgement, dated 21st April, 1987. the appellants petition for decree of divorce was dismissed while the respondent's petition for judicial separation was granted. Maintenance was also held payable to the respondent - wife from the data of the decree till the children of the parties 'attain the age of majority'. The respondent filled first appeal and the learned single judge of the High Court partly allowed the appeal and directed the appellant - husband to pay maintenance from the date of presentation of the petition and not from the date of decree only. The appellant, on the basis of the decree of judicial separation obtained by the respondened, subsequently sought dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground that there had been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties after the decree of judicial separation. A decree of divorce was, accordingly, granted by the matrimonial Court to the appellant on 27.2.1991. The matrimonial court, however, rejected the prayer of the respondent - wife for relief under Section 27 of the Act. The respondent preferred two appeals which came to be disposed of by the Division bench by the common judgement, dated 30.4.1992. while disposing of the appeals, the Division Bench, inter -alia opined that under Section 27 of the Act, the Court had jurisdiction to pass an order regarding the property, as mentioned in the section itself and the trial court, it was held by the Division Bench that the respondent-wife was entitled to an order under section 27 of the Hindu marriage Act in respect of the property claimed by her in Exhibit 'A' and made the order accordingly. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and exclaimed the record. The trial court, while dealing with the question of relief under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act opined. ""In my opinion, the Court trying metrimonial causes, has no jurisdiction to deal with the property rights of the parties.      Hence   I    have    declined    to      determining  the   rights  of   the      parties to a suit"". The learned Single judge, while dealing with this aspect of the case, observed. ""Therefore in my view it is not possible to hold that the wife had established that those ornaments and the property, which she has claimed by schedule Exhibit 'A' were presented to her at or at any time of marriage or to show that this had become the joint property of both husband and wife. Similarly, accordingly to me there is nothing to establish the identify or the co-relation of the golden ornaments contained in the admission of husband and which were claimed by the wife and so called admission of the husband it is not possible to hold that she is entitled to claim the return of any property"". The learned Single Judgement then went on to hold: ""I corner with this and my vie there is no evidence to prove that the property claimed by the wife has presented at or about the time of marriage and/or was belonging jointly to husband and wife"".Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam vs Sangeeta Balkrishna Kadam on 4 September, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1716222/ 2The Division Bench while dealing with this aspect pf the matter held: ""As regards the second head of conclusion recorded by the learned single Judge, the present appeal will have to be allowed and accordingly succeeds. We set aside the order of the learned Single Judge whereby he has held that the matrimonial Court would have no jurisdiction to pass an order in relation to the remaining items of the property. For the reasons recorded by us in this judgement, there shall be a decree in terms of Exhibit 'A' at page 376 of the paper-book. The office shall accordingly draw up a decree in these terms. Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus: ""Disposal of property-In any proceedings this Act, the court may make such provision in proper with respect to any property presented, at or about the time of marriage, which may belong jointly to both the husband and the wife."" On a plain reading of the section. it becomes obvious the Matrimonial Court trying any proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, has the jurisdiction to make such provision in the decree as it deems just and proper with respect to nay property presented ""at or bout the time of marriage"" which may belong jointly to both the husband and wife. This section provides an alternate remedy to the wife so that she can recover the property which is covered by the Section, by including it in the decree in the matrimonial proceedings, without having to take resources to the filling of a separate Civil Suit and avoid further litigation. In the instant case, we find that the wife had laid claim to certain items of jewellery and in her deposition. She had mentioned the items of jewellery which she had received ""at or about the time of her marriage"" and, particular, had mentioned the items of jewellery which were given to her by her father at the time of the marriage. During the course of her depositing, the respondent- wife had stated: ""At the time of may marriage, my father had presented to men one gold necklace weighing 4 1/2 totals, one gold chain weighing about 1 1/2 totals, two gold finger rings, one gold nosering, one pair of earring, one budge, two patlya weighing 5 totals."" In her deposition, she had also mentioned about other items of jewellery and the property given to the parties at or about the time of marriage. The appellant submitted, that the Division bench could not have held the respondent entitled by the wife in Exhibit 'A' as there was no evidence to support her claim of the wife had not been seriously disputed during the cross-examination of the wife and, therefore, the Division Bench rightly granted her claim.Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam vs Sangeeta Balkrishna Kadam on 4 September, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1716222/ 3",['27']
321,"Bombay High Court Madanlal Sharma vs Santosh Sharma on 28 November, 1979 Author: R Jahagirdar Bench: R Jahagirdar JUDGMENT R.A. Jahagirdar, J. 1. The appellant has by this appeal challenged the order of a Judge of the City Civil Court dismissing his petition filed against the respondent for a decree for divorce. The petition, being M.J. Petition No. 6636 of 1973, was filed by the appellant in the City Civil Court at Bombay on 14th of August, 1973 again the respondent alleging that the respondent was guilty of acts of cruelty which would entitle the appellant to a decree for divorce dissolving the marriage of the appellant and the respondent which had taken place on 16th of June, 1965 at Delhi. 2. In the ordinary course, this appeal would have been disposed of on an appreciation of the evidence. However, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which governs the parties and under which the petition for divorce was filed, was substantially amended in the year 1976 and a new ground which would be the basis of a decree for divorce was added in section 13 of the said Act. From the arguments advanced by the Advocates appearing both for the appellant and the respondent before me and on the facts and circumstances of this case it became necessary to consider the proper meaning and legal effect of Clause (ia) of section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Before I proceed to do it the facts which led to the filing of the petition must be stated. As already mentioned above, the parties were married at Delhi on 16th of June, 1965. Two years thereafter, that is in the year 1967, they came to Bombay. The appellant's arrival in Bombay was necessitated by the exigencies of his employment, it is on record that the appellant is employed in the State Bank of India. Two years after their arrival in Bombay, an ownership flat was acquired at Andheri, a suburb of Bombay, by the appellant. The couple has been blessed with three children; the first child who is a daughter was born on 18th of June, 1967; and the second child, a son, was born on 18th of October, 1968. Thereafter, there was some spacing and on 3rd of August, 1972 the last child, which is a daughter, was born. 3. It is also in evidence that sometime in February, 1973 the appellant left the house at Andheri and thus he also left his wife and the three children in the flat at Andheri and went to reside in a separate house at Vikhroli, which is another suburb of Bombay. Before that, however, on 23rd of January, 1973 he gave a registered notice to the respondent alleging that the respondent was guilty of several acts of misconduct such as failing to attend to house hold duties, failing to look after a child and her education, behaving in an insulting and humiliating , manner particularly of using most abusive words in Punjabi language not followed by the neighbours; running from the house on the road at some times shouting and crying without any reason or provocation with a view to create an impression that the appellant was harassing and assaulting her and of neglecting to cook food or of keeping the same ready when the appellant returned from the office fully tired. The act of misconduct which is mentioned at No. 5 on page 4 of this notice (Ex. B on the record) is of making baseless and cheap allegations ""against the character of my client involving even nearest relations of sister and mother as well as the maid servant and any name that came to your tongue just to use abusive and provocative language"". By the said notice the Advocate for the appellant mentioned thatMadanlal Sharma vs Santosh Sharma on 28 November, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1196139/ 1the regular repetition of the respondent's behaviour has made it impossible for the appellant to continue to stay in the house though the same belongs to him. He told the respondent that she had no right to the said premises and further that by her behaviour she had forfeited any right whatsoever to stay as the wife of the appellant in the said premises. It was further mentioned that the appellant having been sufficiently humiliated in the neighbourhood and the house itself, the appellant had decided to give up the said flat. The respondent was called upon to make her own arrangements for staying elsewhere failing which the appellant would take action for judicial separation and also to deal with the property in accordance with law. I have felt it necessary to refer to the allegations made in the notice it the outset itself because it will obviate the necessity of reverting to the contents of this notice later when the appreciation of the rival contentions is to be made. Apart from referring to the baseless and cheap allegations against the character of the appellant involving, among others, a maid servant, it has not been alleged in this notice that the respondent made any allegations of infidelity on the part of the appellant or of the appellant's illicit relations with any person. 4. Since the respondent did not comply with the requisitions contained in this notice, the appellant filed the petition for judicial separation on 14th of August, 1973 on the ground of what the appellant called cruelty. The acts of cruelty enumerated in the petition are practically the same which have been mentioned in the notice. There are, however, a few more acts mentioned in the petition. One of them is alleged act of the respondent in bringing the children to the office of the appellant on 5th of April, 1973 and leaving them there after creating a scene. At the time when this petition for judicial separation was filed, what can be for brevity's sake called the ground of cruelty was not available for obtaining a decree of divorce. Section 10(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it stood before the amendment of 1976, permitted a party to a marriage to present a petition praying for a decree for judicial separation on that ground that the other party ""has treated the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party."" In the year 1976, by Act No. LXVIII of 1976 the Parliament made several changes under the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 10 which deals with judicial separation, after the amendment, only mentions that either party to a marriage may present a petition praying for a decree for judicial separation on any of the grounds specified in sub-section (1) of section 13 and in the case of a wife also on any of the grounds specified in sub-section (2) thereof, as grounds on which a petition for divorce might have been presented. In other words, the grounds on which a petition for judicial separation can be presented are not enumerated in section 10, but are by incorporation mentioned as those enumerated in section 13 of the Act. I have already mentioned above that prior to the amendment of 1976 the ground of cruelty was not one of the grounds on which a petition could be presented for divorce. After the amendment of 1976, section 13 allows a party to present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party ""(ia) has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelly."" The difference in the language relating to the ground cruelty as it was in section 10 prior to the amendment of 1976 and now in section 13 after the amendment is too striking to be missed even by casual observer. The difference in the language of the provision prior the amendment of 1976 and the provision after the amendment of 1976 has led to considerable debate before me in this appeal. At this stage I may mention that after the Hindu Marriage Act was amended in 1976, the appellant amended his petition by substituting the prayer for divorce in placeMadanlal Sharma vs Santosh Sharma on 28 November, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1196139/ 2of an original prayer for judicial separation. This was the only amendment which was made by the appellant in his petition before the trial Court after the amendment of the Hindu Marriage Act in 1976. 5. The respondent filed her written statement on 21st of January, 1974 and denied that she has been guilty of the acts of cruelty alleged against her by the appellant. In paragraph 9 of her written statement, however, the respondent mentioned that when she was in the Maternity Home for about 10 days during her last confinement in August 1972 the appellant had developed illicit connection with the maid servant employed by the family. The allegation about the illicit relationship between the appellant and the maid servant was made by the respondent on the basis of what her neighbours told her after she returned from the hospital. It is unnecessary to refer to the other averments in the written statement except to mention that the respondent denied the various acts of cruelty alleged against her. 6. The learned trial Judge raised four issues the first of which was as follows. ""Whether the petitioner proves that the respondent has been guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition."" The second issue related to the question of the condonation of the acts of cruelty, if they were proved. The third and fourth issues related to the custody of the minor children and the maintenance of the respondent. While considering issue No. 1 before him, the learned trial Judge addressed himself to two questions. One related to the standard of proof required in a case of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of cruelty and secondly the meaning of cruelty itself. On consideration of some of the authorities which were cited before him the learned trial Judge came to the conclusion that the burden of proof in a case of divorce was higher than in a case of judicial separation and he preferred to follow what he thought was the law laid down by the decisions of the Supreme Court in Mahendra Minakshi v. Sushila, White v. White, , and Bipin Chander Shah v. Prabhavati, . In other words, he came to the conclusion that in a case of divorce the burden of proving the matrimonial offence was higher and the case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and not merely on preponderance of probability. This view which the learned trial Judge took must be held to be erroneous in view of a decision of this Court in Kamal Tukaram Choudhary v. Rumchandra Laxman Vagulde, 1978 Mah.L.J. 598. This decision survey's the relevant authorities of the Supreme Court upto that date and also refers to the provisions of section 25(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act. In that case a question had arisen as to the standard of proof required for substantiating the charge of unchastity. It was held that in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dr. N.G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane, , the burden of proving matrimonal offences was no higher than in civil proceedings, that is, a fact can be established if it is proved by preponderance of probability. The learned trial Judge was in error in making a distinction between a case for judicial separation and a case for divorce, because the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Dastane v. Dastane does not make any such distinction and secondly section 25(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act itself does not make any such distinction. On the question of the burden of proof, therefore, one must proceed on the basis that the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Dastane v. Dastane is the last word.Madanlal Sharma vs Santosh Sharma on 28 November, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1196139/ 3",['10']

At the outset, it must be stated that this matter was heard earlier at length by my learned brother A. C. Agarwal, J. last year and efforts were made to bring about a reconciliation in accordance with the mandate of sub-sec. (2) of S. 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act. However, both the learned counsel conceded before me that the said efforts had failed and it was necessary, therefore, to again hear the matter on merits. When this matter was initially taken up by me for hearing on Friday, the 13th March 1992, I again asked both the learned counsel as to whether it was still possible to bring about a reconciliation. Both the learned counsel frankly stated that it was not possible. Since, however, the matter was part heard on Friday, the 13th March, and was thereafter heard on Tuesday, the 17th March, Wednesday, the 18th March and Friday, the 20th March, both the learned counsel were permitted to make a statement if a reconciliation was possible even in the course of hearing, from Friday, the 13th March to this day. However, both the learned counsel frankly stated that it was not possible. Hence, it has become necessary for me to dispose of the matter on the basis of the material before me. 3. Two questions of law arise for my determination, viz. : (i) Whether pending an application under O. 9, R. 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for restoration of the petition filed by the husband for divorce, can the wife initiate proceedings under S. 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings?. (ii) Can the husband be allowed to withdraw his application for restoration under O. 9, R. 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure so as to defeat the wife's application under S. 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act?Vinod Kimar Kejriwal vs Usha Vinod Kejriwal on 20 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/771773/ 1Since, unfortunately, the petition has a chequered history, a few relevant dates and facts may be stated as under :-- 4. The petitioner Vinod married the respondent Usha on 24th May 1983 at Bombay. Son Vishal was born on 8th May 1984. Fortunately, there is no controversy about the paternity of legitimacy of Vishal. It appears that on 26th October 1985 the husband filed a petition in the Court at Mathura, being Petition No. 385 of 1985 for divorce on the ground that the wife was living in adultery and was guilty of cruelty and desertion. The said Mathura Petition was served on the wife on 2nd November 1985 at Bombay. -On the 26th November 1985, the wife filed a petition in the City Civil Court, Bombay, being Petition No. 1102 of 19S5 for restitution of conjugal rights and took out some motions for interim reliefs in the said Bombay Petition. Ad interim order was passed in favour of the respondent-wife in the said Bombay Petition on the 26th November 1985 in the nature of appointment of Commissioner in respect of the bungalow at Goregaon, a suburb of Bombay -- the matrimonial home of the couple. 5. Reverting to the Mathura Petition, the returnable date, mentioned in the summons served on the wife, was 25th November 1985. Admittedly, 27th November 1985 was a holiday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. The petition seems to have been wrongly placed on board before the learned Judge, Mathura, on 28th November 1985, thought the returnable date was 29th November 1985. Since none of the parlies was present on 28th November 1985 at Mathura, the petition filed by the husband was dismissed for default on that day. When the wife's brother, who was her constituted attorney, and her Advocate reached Mathura on the 29th November 1985, the day mentioned in the summons served upon her, they found that the petition had been dismissed for default on the prior day. The husband himself realised on the 29th November 1985 that his petition was erroneously dismissed for default on the 28th November 1985. On 29th November 1985 itself, the wife filed a caveat in the Mathura Court, anticipating further proceedings being adopted by the husband. On the 3rd December 1985 one Kanchanlal Agarwal presented an application purporting to act on behalf of the husband and prayed for restoration of the husband's petition, viz. Petition No. 385 of 1985 filed in the Mathura Court for divorce. There is some controversy about this application. However, admittedly, the husband himself presented an application on the 4th December 1985 for restoration of his dismissed petition. The said application has been styled to be an application under O. 9, R. 4 read with S. 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The husband has categorically pointed out in the said application dated 4th December 1985 that his petition was to be heard on the 29th November 1985 and not on the 28th November 1985 on which date it was erroneously dismissed. The husband states that he was keen to contest his petition for the relief of divorce; that its dismissal in the manner aforesaid was causing irreparable hardship to him and hence, it was liable to be restored for being heard on merits. On 13th December 1985 the Mathura Court informed the wife's Advocate at Bombay viz. Shri P. H. Wadhwany, that the husband had presented an application for restoration and the hearing of the said application was fixed on 18(h January 1986. In the first week of January 1986, the wife moved the Supreme Court by filing Transfer Petition No. 64 of 1986. The wife contended that the marriage was solemnised in Bombay; the husband was carrying on his business in Bombay; he owned petrol pump and automobile garage in Bombay; he owned a bungalow as also certain shops in Bombay and that the petition was deliberately filed at Mathura with a view to harassing the wife and making it impossible for her to contest the petition with her child of tenderVinod Kimar Kejriwal vs Usha Vinod Kejriwal on 20 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/771773/ 2age and hence, she prayed for transfer of the petit ion from Mathura Court to the City Civil Court, at Bombay. In the transfer petition before the Supreme Court, the husband filed his affidavit-in-reply denying the allegations made by the wife and contended that since the wife had last resided with him at Mathura in the month of September 1984, the Mathura Court did have the necessary jurisdiction to entertain his petition for divorce. The husband stated in his affidavit-in-rcply that the material witnesses would be available at Mathura and it would, therefore, be extremely difficult and inconvenient if the petition was to be transferred to Bombay. Finally, the husband stated that he would have no objection to the petition being transferred from Mathura to Bombay, subject to the undertaking to be given by the wife that she will have no objection to the examination of the witnesses on commission and that the matter will be disposed of exppdiliously at Bombay. It needs to be stated at this juncture itself that the Supreme Court has passed an order on the 15th December 1986 which reads as under :-- ""The respondent has no objection to the suit being transferred to Bombay provided that the wife does not object to the witnesses being examined on commission at Mathura, if it is found necessary to examine them. Suit No. 385 of 1985 and Misc. Application No. 161 of 1985 now pending in the Court of Civil Judge, Mathura are transferred to the City Civil Court, Bombay subject to the condition that the petitioner will not raise any objection to any witnesses being examined on commission, at Mathura. Transfer petition is disposed of accordingly."" 6. Thus, the result of the above Supreme Court order is that the Mathura Petition No. 385 of 1985 was transferred to Bombay and was numbered as M. J. Petition No. 76 of 1988 in the City Civil Court, Bombay, and is still pending final adjudicature. The application for restoration filed by the husband on the 4th December 1985 viz. Application No. 161 of 1985 in the Mathura Court was numbered as Misc. Petition No. 23 of 1988 in the City Civil Court, at Bombay. However, before the proceedings were so re-numbered pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court dated 15th December 1986, the wife had filed Notice of Motion No. 6849 of 1987 under S. 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the 15th October 1987, which was registered on the 31st December 1987 on which the impugned order has been passed by the learned trial Judge on 30th August 1989. 7. As indicated earlier, the wife had also filed a petition in the Bombay City Civil Court earlier for restitution of conjugal rights being M. J. Petition No. 1102 of 1985. Both the parties had taken out some proceedings for interim reliefs such as appointment of a Commissioner in respect of the bungalow at Goregaon, interim alimony pcndente lite in the petition filed by the wife at Bombay, as also for custody of the child by the husband. In March 1986, certain ad interim orders had been passed in those proceedings which need not be discussed here in details. Suffice it to say that on the 7th October 1986, in the petition filed by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights, the City Civil Court passed an order directing the husband to pay interim alimony to the wife at the rate of Rs. 1500/-per month for the period commencing from 1st March 1986 till October 1986 only. In the said Bombay Petition filed by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights, the husband in fact wanted to submit to a decree. On the 7th October 1986 the City Civil Court passed an order permitting the wife to withdraw the petition and dismissed the same for want of prosecution with no order as to costs.Vinod Kimar Kejriwal vs Usha Vinod Kejriwal on 20 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/771773/ 3",['24']

Present suits arc filed by Christian wives for dissolution of their marriages under Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act'). Each of them impugn the vires of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act which provides for the grounds on which a husband and wife can sue for dissolution of marriage. It is contended that the provisions are archaic and adversely discriminate wives as against husbands merely on ground of sex and are, therefore, violative of article 15 of the Constitution. It is further contended that the aforesaid provisions adversely discriminate them vis-a-vis wives belonging to other communities. They are, therefore, denied equality before law and hence the provisions are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. It is also contended that the aforesaid provisions force them to continue to live with their husbands as wives even though they are subjected to cruelty or desertion. They are, therefore, deprived of their right to life and personal liberty thereby violating their dignity. The provisions, therefore, contravene Article 21 of the Constitution. 2. Plaintiffs have also impugned certain ancillary provisions of the Act namely Sections 17 and 20 of the Act which provide for a requirement of confirmation of decrees for dissolution of marriage or nullity of marriage, passed by District Judges, by the High Court and that too normally by a Bench of not less than three Judges. 3. Present suits were filed on the original side of this Court and came up for hearing before the learned single Judge Mrs K. K. Baam, J. When the aforesaid challenges was raised before her, by an order passed on 20th of December, 1996, she has referred the suits to a larger Bench under Rule 28 of the High Court. Original Side Rules, 1980. The learned Chief Justice has, thereafter, referred the suits to the present Full Bench for deciding the aforesaid issues raised in these suits. 4. Sections 10, 17 and 20 of the Act, insofar as they are relevant, provides as under: ""10. When husband may petition for dissolution. --Any husband may present a petition to the District Court or to the High Court, praying that his marriage may be dissolved on the ground that his wife has, since the solemnization thereof, been guilty of adultery. When wife may petition for dissolution. --Any wife may present a petition to the District Court or to the High Court, praying that her marriage may be dissolved on the ground that, since the solemnization thereof, her husband has exchanged his profession of Christianity for the profession of some other religion, and gone through a form of marriage with another woman;Mrs. Pragati Varghese And Etc. vs Cyril George Varghese And Etc. on 6 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1401518/ 1or has been guilty of incestuous adultery, or of bigamy with adultery, or of marriage with another woman with adultery. or of rape, sodomy or bestiality, or of adultery coupled with such cruelty as without adultery would have entitled her to a divorce a mensa et thoro, or of adultery coupled with desertion, without reasonable excuse, for two years or upwards."" 17. Confirmation of decree for dissolution by District Judge. -- Every decree for a dissolution of marriage made by a District Judge shall be subject to confirmation by the High Court. Cases for confirmation of a decree for dissolution of marriage shall be heard (where the number of the Judges of the High Court is three or upwards) by a Court composed of three such Judges and in case of difference the opinion of the majority shall prevail, or (where the number of the Judges of the High Court is two) by a Court composed of such two Judges, and in case of difference the opinion of the Senior Judges shall prevail. 20. Confirmation of District Judge's decree. -- Every decree of nullity of marriage made by a District Judge shall be subject to confirmation by the High Court and the provisions of Section seventeen, clauses one, two, three and four, shall, mutatis mutandis apply to such decrees."" 5. Mrs. Desai, Mrs. Agnes and Mr. Bagaria appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs have contended that the grounds available to the husbands and wives under Section 10 of the Act are discriminatory. Whereas a husband can claim divorce merely by proving that his wife has been guilty of adultery, the wife is not given a similar right. She is required to prove that her husband is guilty of incestuous adultery or bigamy with adultery or marriage with another woman, with adultery or adultery coupled with cruelly or, adultery coupled with desertion. They have further contended that wives, who arc governed by the Act, arc also discriminated vis-a-vis wives governed by other statues such as (i) Hindi Marriage Act, 1955 (ii) Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, (iii) The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, (iv) The Special Marriage Act, 1954, and (v) The Foreign Marriage Act, 1959. Whereas the aforesaid enactments have provided larger rights to the wives to claim divorce, the same is denied to wives who are governed by the present Act. Aforesaid provisions of 'the Act' are, therefore, violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. It is further contended that the legal effect Of Section 10 is to compel wives who are cruelly treated or arc deserted to continue to live as the wife of a man she hates. Such a life will be a sub-human life without dignity and personal liberty and is, therefore, violative of Article 21 Of the Constitution. 6. Under Section 22 of 'the Act', it is pointed out that Christian spouses are not entitled to dissolution of marriage on grounds of adultery, cruelly or desertion but are entitled Only to judicial separation which has the effect of a divorce a mensa et thoro i.e. separation only from bed and board whereunder matrimonial bonds remain undissolved. But spouses governed by other Acts such as Special Marriage Act, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 are entitled to dissolution of marriage and not merely judicial separation on these grounds. Christian spouses are thus discriminated only on the ground of their being Christians by religion. This violates the mandate of Article 15 of the Constitution.Mrs. Pragati Varghese And Etc. vs Cyril George Varghese And Etc. on 6 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1401518/ 27. Article 21 guarantees protection of life and personal liberty. Right to life, includes the right to life with human dignity. A Christian wife, who is treated cruelly by her husband and is subjected to indignities is compelled to live with him without dignity. Personal liberty guaranteed to every person under Article 21 of the Constitution is denied to Christian women. 8. It is further contended that the ambit and scope of Article 21 has been expanded by Courts from time to time keeping pace with the changes in society and changing needs of the people. The Supreme Court has expanded the reach and ambit of the fundamental right of personal liberty enshrined in Article 21 being of widest amplitude. Reliance has been placed on the cases of (i) ""Pathumma v. State of Kerala"", ; (ii) Francis Colaria Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi AIR 1981 SC 746; (iii) ""Smt. Triveniben v. State of Gujarat"", AIR 1989 SC 1355; and (iv) ""Unni Krishnan J.P. v. State of Andhra Pradesh"", . In the case of ""P.T. Parmanand Katara v. Union of India"", , the Supreme Court has gone on lo hold that the right to dignity and fair treatment under Article 21 is not only avail a living man but also to his body after his Jail Authorities all over the country are directed not to keep the body of condemned prisoner suspended after the medical officer has declared him dead. Christian women have, however, been left far behind. 9. It is contended that Section 10 of the Act, to the extent that it requires adultery to be coupled with cruelty as a ground for divorce is viotative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The right to life under Article 21 takes in its sweep a right to life with dignity, without cruelty, mental or physical, and without constant fear of torture and violence. The right to life guaranteed by the Constitution includes the right to seek dissolution of marriage if its existence is an unbearable suffering. Section 10 denies the Christian woman the right to get dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty even when the marital relationship has been broken. Such a law that compels her to live with a person who is her tormentor till death is oppressive, arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. It will be a sub-human life without dignity. It will be a life without freedom and personal liberty. To uphold the dignity of the individual in all respects as ensured by the preamble of the Constitution is the need of the hour. 'The Act' is a pre-constitutional legislation and in the present time is antiquated and contrary to the mandate underlying the Constitution. In the grounds allowed by the laws of dissolution of marriage, there is a discriminatory treatment meted out to Christian spouses. The discrimination is based solely on religion and hence is violative of Article 15. 10. In the context of the aforesaid submissions advanced before us, it would be useful to note the background under which 'the Act' was enacted. 11. Christiansin India belong to three different traditions i.e. (i) Roman Catholics, (ii) Protestants who are followers of Church of South India (CSI) and Church of North India (CNI), and (iii) Syrian Christians, who are followers of Greek Orthodox Churches. There is also a large population of Christians among various tribes particularly in the North-East region. These tribes are granted protection under the Constitution in respect of their culture, tradition, customs and laws. 12. Among the three traditions, only the Roman Catholic Church considers marriage to be a sacrament and subscribes to the doctrine of indissolubility of marriage. The other two Churches namely the Protestant Churches as well as Orthodox Churches do not have doctrinaire objection toMrs. Pragati Varghese And Etc. vs Cyril George Varghese And Etc. on 6 May, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1401518/ 3","['22', '10']"

This appeal is directed against the judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Murshida-bad in Matrimonial Suit No.67 of 1982 by which the learned trial court dismissed the matrimonial suit which was filed by the appellant husband against the respondent wife praying for a decree of divorce under Section 13(1) (ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. Admittedly the parties were married according to Hindu rites on the 6th Falgun 1385 B.S. corresponding to Feb. 1979. Admittedly a daughter was born to the parties. The husband prayed for divorce on grounds of cruelty and desertion. The case of the appellant husband is that the respondent wife always used to quarrel with the husband and his parents without any just reason and she also used to insist upon the petitioner to live separately from his family which the petitioner did not agree. It is the contention of the husband that on 12th May, 1980 the wife left the matrimonial home secretly for residing at her father's house and on 13th/14th May, 1980 she along with her brother went to Lalgola P.S. and lodged afalse F.I.R. against the husband and his parents and the husband had to surrender and apply for bail and was ultimately released on bail. It may be mentioned here that the matrimonial home of the parties is at Lalgola and the wife's father's house is at Muragachha which is about three hours journey from Lalgola as we get it from evidence. It may also be noted here that at the relevant time the husband was an employee of the J.D.R.O's office a: Jangipur. The wife also filed an application under Section 125, Cr.P.C. against the husband for maintenance. The husband's contention is that the wife has deserted him since 12th May, 1980. It is also the contention of the husband that by lodging F.I.R. and thus initiating a criminal case end also by filing a petition under Section 125, Cr.P.C. for maintenance, the wife has committed cruelty for which the husband is entitled to divorce. In the application for divorce the husband has also sitated that several times he went to bring back the wife to her matrominal home but she turned down his request. In paragraph 2 of the application the husband says that in view of the circumstances that the wife has deserted him for about two years and has caused cruelty by instituting two criminal proceedings, he prays for judicial separation. However, in the prayer portion the husband prays for decree of divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is also to be mentioned here that in paragraph 2 of the application the husband has stated that the wife arrived at Lalgola about four days before the husband filed the application for divorce and she also threatened the father of the petitioner with the help of a few local people as the petitioner permanently resides at Jangipur where he is an employee in the office of the J.L.R.O. The application for divorces was filed in the Court oi the. District Judge Beharmpur on 9-9-1992. 3. The suit was contested by the wife by filing a written statement. She denied all the allegations made against her. On the other hand she stated in the written statement that she was tortured in her matrimonial home by her husband, mother-in-law, husband's sister and the climax of such tortureTapan Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt. Jyotsna Chakraborty on 9 July, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1955779/ 1reached sometime in May 1980 when she was made to go without food for days and was assaulted and manhandled on the slightest protest to their acts of violence and insult. It is also alleged in the written statement that her father-in-law left for Puri on 10-5-1980 and on 13-5-1980 the husband, his mother and his sister badly assaulted the wife as she refused to leave the house leaving the baby daughter at their mercy and on the following day, that is, on 14-5-1980 these three persons again assaulted her mercilessly and when she was lying unconscious in the room in which she was confined her elder brother Harihar Mukherjee arrived there and with the help of neighbours and police rescued her and she was brought to her father's house by her brother, but her daughter was not allowed to go with her. According to the cases of the wife the incident was reported at Lalgola P.S. on which a police case was started and on investigation a charge-sheet was submitted. It is also an admitted fact that the wife, while she was staying in her brother's house, filed an application for maintenance against the husband under Section 125, Cr. P.C. In paragraph 11 of the written statement it is stated that subsequently as the husband fell flat oh the feet of the respondent wife's brother and mother the wife went to the matrimonial home and withdrew the criminal case as well as the maintenance case. It is also alleged by the wife in the written statement that while she had been to the husband's house the same acts of insult and oppression continued and the husband brought in his house one Tripti Chakraborty, an unmarried girl of Jangipur, who had an immoral intrigue with the husband for which the said Tripti was driven away by the people of her locality and he expressed his determination to marry her. It may be noted here that while the wife was staying in the Matrimonial home at Lalgola she received summons of the divorce suit. It is also alleged by the wife in the written statement that similar ill-treatment, as was done to the wife, was also done to Asoka, the wife of the husband's brother and as a result of such ill-treatment and forture and humiliation Ashoka left for her father's house with her unmarried daughter. 4. At the trial both sides led evidence and the learned trial Court in the impugned judgment rather found that the allegation of desertion and cruelty of the wife was not substantiated. The learned trial Court also obseved that the allegation of the wife that the petitioner was involved in an illicit affair with Tripti Chakraborty will not amount to cruelty as nobody knows if the allegation was false or true. It may be mentioned here that it was argued on behalf of the husband that the false allegation of illicit affair with Tripti. itself amounts to cruelty for which alone the husband is entitled to a decree of divorce. That was however turned down by the learned trial Court as noted above. The learned trial Court dismissed the suit and against such dismissal the appellant husband has preferred the present appeal. 5. In going to consider the question whether this Court in this appeal should interfere with the judgment and decree of the learned Court below, we will rather now proceed to look into the evidence adduced by the parties before the trial Court. We have already gone through respective cases of the parties as pleaded in their respective pleadings. Here at the very outset we would like to mention that the learned Advocate for the appellant has rightly criticised that the learned Court below has discussed the case, particularly the evidence adduced by the parties, in a very cryptic way. Indeed we endorse this view of the learned Advocate that the discussion of the evidence and the facts and circumstances of the case by the learned Court below was rather cryptic and there should have been a mere elaborate discussion, particularly by the trial Court, on the different aspects of the matter which the learned trial Court unfortunately did not do. But at the same time we must alsoTapan Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt. Jyotsna Chakraborty on 9 July, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1955779/ 2note that failure on the part of the trial court to discuss the matter properly or to scrutinize the evidence mere elaborately will not by itself be aground for reversing the decision of the trial Court and for granting decree in favour of the appellant husband. Rather, we for ourselves will go into the details of the evidence and see whether the appellant husband on the basis of such evidence is really entitled to a decree in this case, whatever may be the shortcomings of the judgment appealed against. 6. P.W. 1 Tapan Kumar Chakraborty is the appellant husband. He says that after the marriage the O.P. (wife) came to reside with him at his house at Lalgola and that thereafter his relation with her became strained as she used to insist on her living separate from his parents to which he did not agree. He says that as he did not agree to the proposal of his wife, she used to abuse him all the time and also used to quarrel with him and after persistent quarrel on 12-5-1980 his wife left his house for good and went to reside in the house of her father. He further says that his wife left his house without informing them and without their knowledge. This seems to us rather improbable that the wife will leave the house of the husband without informing and beyond the knowledge of any one, leaving behind her own child there. The husband further says that on 14-5-1980 his wife accompanied by her brother went to Laigola P.S. and lodged false F.I.R. against himself, his parents and his elder sister and elder brother. He says that they had to surrender in Court and take bail from criminal Court. He further says that subsequently the criminal case was compromised on 4-5-1981. The husband has, in the application for divorce, taken the plea that filing of the F.I.R. or for that matter the initiation of the criminal case by the wife constitutes an act of cruelty. It was therefore, incumbent upon the husband to produce before the Court a copy of the F.I.R. lodged by or on behalf of the wife as the best evidence on the point so that the Court could scrutinise the same and find out for itself as to what were the exact allegations made therein and against whom. The fact that the respondent also admits that one F.I.R. was lodged over the incident of assault and torture allegedly committed on her on the 13th/ 14th May, 1980 does not by itself give a clear picture of the criminal proceeding started by or at the instance of the wife. It is said by the husband that the police also submitted charge-sheet and it was a case under Section 307, I.P.C. It is not understood, if really police submitted charge-sheet under Section 307, I.P.C. in that event how the case could be withdrawn by the wife or compromised by the parties. Be that as it may, the husband, as we have seen, in his own evidence has stated that criminal case was compromised. But at the same time the fact remains that we do not know exactly what were the allegations made in the F.I.R. and against whom and what were the sections under which that F.I.R. was recorded and what was the precise charge-sheet, if any. submitted in the matter after investigation. The husband says in his deposition that he has no connection with his Latgola house since 1979 as he has to stay at Jangipur. He further says that since his wife left his house on 12-5-1980 he has no connection or relationship with his wife and his wife never came to reside with him as his wife. He says that he tried to bring his wife back but in vain. He says that as his wife instituted criminal case and maintenance case against him he has been put to indignity and he was mentally and physically harassed. He also says that he knows the allegations made by his wife against him in her written statement and after knowing this he was mentally depressed. In his cross-examination he says that the police submitted charge-sheet in this case filed by his wife at Lalbag court and it was a case under Section 307, I.P.C. He says that his parents, brother and sister did not compromise that case but his wife herself withdrew the case. As we have noticed, in his examination in chief he however, told that this case was compromised butTapan Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt.

O.S. 39/1976 is by the children of Raman Nair from his first wife for partition of one item of property that was held in tenancy-in-common by Raman Nair and his second wife. The plaintiffs in O.S. 39/1976 claim partition of a half share as belonging to Raman Nair and seek separate allotment of the same. 4. In all these suits the contention of the children of Raman Nair from his first wife, is that the second wife and children are not his legal heirs. According to them Raman Nair did not have a second wife. He was only keeping a concubine and the children born to such a woman are not the legal heirs of deceased Raman Nair. The second wife and children of Raman Nair contended that they are also the legal heirs of Raman Naif as, according to them, there was a valid marriage between Raman Nair and the defendant in O.S. 39/1976 and the children born in that wedlock are also the legal heirs of Raman Nair. It was however admitted that the second marriage of Raman Nair was at a time when his first wife Ammu Ammawas alive, and the first marriage was subsisting. The Court below has therefore found that the second marriage is invalid and the children born of the second marriage are not the legal heirs of Raman Nair. The Court below has also found that the properties mentioned in O.S. 38/1976. and in schedules A and B, of the plaint, in O.S. 99/1977 (except the two clinics in Schedule B) belonged to Raman Nair. The C schedule movables, even though belonged to Raman Nair, are found not now available for partition. The Court below has also found that the property in O.S. 39/1976 belonged in tenancy-in-common to Raman Nair and his second wife who is the sole defendant in that suit, and the plaintiffs who are his children from his first wife, being his legal heirs, are entitled to partition and separate allotment of a half share in that property. On the finding that the second wife and children are not the legal heirs of Raman Nair, the suit O.S. 38/1976 was decreed for recovery of possession of the properties mentioned therein from the defendants. O.S.99/1979 for partition by the second wife and children was dismissed.Parayankandiyil Eravath ... vs K. Devi And Ors. on 22 June, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/355223/ 15. Learned counsel for the appellants Sri R. Bhaskaran has urged only one point before us and that is that the second wife and children are also the legal heirs of Raman Nair. According to learned counsel Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act confers legitimacy on the children born in the second wife and they are also the legal heirs of deceased Raman Nair. The relevant clauses of Section 16 are extracted below : ""Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.- (1) Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and, void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. * * * * * (3) Nothing contained in Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void of which is annulled by a decree of nullity wider. Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the ligitimate child of his parents."" The legitimacy conferred by Sub-section (1) is on the children born of a marriage null and void under Section 11. Section 11 applies only to marriages solemnized after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act and does not relate to marriages solemnized prior to the said Act. Section 11 reads : ''Void marriages.-- Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto, against the other party be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Clauses (1), (iv) and (v) of Section 5."" Clause (i) of Section 5 invalidates a marriage if either party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. In the present case, however, there is no dispute that the second marriage of Raman Xair was prior to the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act and it was at a time when his first wife Ammu Amma was living. The invalidity of the second marriage is not for the reason of Section 11 which would apply only to marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Act. The second marriage of Raman Nair was at a time when the Madras Marumakkathayam Act, 1933 was in force. Section 5 of the said Act provided that during the continuance of a prior marriage which is valid under Section 4, any marriage contracted by either of the parties thereto on or after the date on which the said Act came into force shall be void. The invalidity of the second marriage of Raman Nair was therefore for the reason of violation of Section 5 of the Madras Marumakkathayam Act. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not purport to confer legitimacy on children born of a marriage invalid under the law in force prior to the commencement of the Act.Parayankandiyil Eravath ... vs K. Devi And Ors. on 22 June, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/355223/ 26. Learned counsel for the appellants relies on Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides for overriding effect of any law in force immediately before, the commencement of the Act. The relevant part of Section 4 reads :-- ""Overriding effect of Act.---- ** ** ** (b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act."" According to learned counsel the subsistance of a valid marriage at the time of the second marriage invalidates the second marriage both under the Mammakkathayam law as well as under the Hindu Marriage Act. The invalidity of the marriage under Section 5 of the Marumakkathayam Act is a matter provided for in Section 11 read with Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act and such invalidity, according to learned counsel, should therefore be construed as an invalidity under Section 11 of the Act. We see no merit in this submission as Section 11 on its express terms applies only to marriages solemnized after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act and it has no application to marriages solemnized prior to the Act. The conferment of legitimacy under Section 16 of the Act is only on the child born of a marriage null and void under Section 11 which can apply only to a marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act. 7. Learned counsel made a further submission that the conferment of legitimacy by Section 16 of the Act on children born of marriages after the commencement of the Act to the exclusion of children born of marriages solemnized prior to the Act is discriminatory and is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Much reliance is placed on the decision in D. S. Nakara v. Union of India. AIR 1983 SC 130 in support of this proposition. In that case a memorandum of the Ministry of Finance conferring the benefits of revised pension only on those retiring on or after a particular date was held to be discriminatory for the reason that all pensioners belong to the same category and there was no reasonable nexus between the classification and the objects of the memorandum providing for revised pension. Accordingly the words in the Government memorandum ""who were in service on 31st March, 1979 and retiring from service on or after that date"" were struck down as discriminatory and opposed to Article 14 of the Constitution extending the benefits to all the pensioners whatever be their respective dates of retirement. The Supreme Court observed : ""42, If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision, and would such classification be founded on some rational principle? The classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. We have set out the objects underlying the payment of pension. If the State considered it necessary to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind it for granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to that date simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior to that date.""Parayankandiyil Eravath ... vs K.

326,"Punjab-Haryana High Court Smt. Malkan Rani vs Krishan Kumar on 21 April, 1960 Equivalent citations: AIR 1961 P H 42 Bench: B Narain, I Dua JUDGMENT 1. In October 1958 Krishan Kumar applied under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 11955, for restitution of conjugal rights against his wife Mst. Malkan Rani. The wife made an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act for her maintenance pendents lite and for expenses to defend herself. The learned Senior Sub Judge Ambala, by order dated 6-2-1959 directed the husband to pay Rs. 40/- per mensem as maintenance pendente lite with effect from 1-2-1959 and to pay to her another sum of Rs. 150/- as litigation expenses. The learned Judge further directed him to pay this amount on or before 6-3-1959 failing which the wife would be at liberty to realise this amount by taking execution proceedings. The husband has not paid the maintenance nor litigation expenses. Mst. Malkan Rani then applied to the Court that proceedings in the suit should be stayed till the payment of these amounts because otherwise she could not defend herself. This petition was rejected on the ground that she could enforce the order only in execution proceedings and that there was no provision in the Hindu Marriage Act under which the husband could be compelled to pay this amount by stay of the proceedings. Dissatisfied with this order Mst. Malkan Rani appealed to this Court. The appeal came before Dua J. who referred it to a larger Bench and it has now come before us for decision. 2. The only point that requires determination in this case is whether or not the proceedings in the suit filed by the husband for restitution of conjugal rights could be stayed till the husband paid the amount which he had been ordered to pay under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 3. The Indian Legislature by enacting the Hindu Marriage Act (Act 25 of 1955) has codified the law relating to marital relations among Hindus. Section 21 of the Act makes the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to proceedings under this Act Section 24 relates to maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings. It reads: ""Section 24. Where in any proceedings under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings, and monthly during the proceedings such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable."" Section 28 is the other section which must be taken into consideration in the present appeal. It reads: ""Section 28. All decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force.""Smt. Malkan Rani vs Krishan Kumar on 21 April, 1960 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/607623/ 14. It was contended on behalf of the wife that the Hindu Marriage Act does not lay down any specific provision for enforcing an order under Section 24 of the Act, and, therefore, the matrimonial Court can stay further proceedings in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. On the other hand, the contention raised on behalf of the husband was that Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down the method for enforcing an order made under the Act and its enforcement by another procedure must be held to have been prohibited or excluded. 5. Now Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act empowers the matrimonial Court to make an order for maintenance pendente lite and for expenses of proceedings to a needy and indigent spouse. The object and purpose of this statutory provision, obviously is to enable the Court to see that the indigent spouse is put in a financial condition in which the party concerned may produce proper material and evidence in the case. The Intention of the Legislature in enacting this provision is to see that a party is not handicapped in or prevented from bringing all the relevant facts before the Court for decision of the case because of his or her poverty. Now in the Punjab no counsel can appear in Court without previously getting his fee or remuneration. Other litigation expenses have also to ba incurred during the proceedings. Similarly pendente lite maintenance allowance is to be utilized during the pendency of the litigation and not afterwards. If these amounts are not made available to the applicant under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act immediately, then its object and purpose will stand defeated. The relations between the two spouses in a litigation under the Hindu Marriage Act are likely to be hostile and the spouse who has to pay litigation expenses is likely to be unwilling to pay these amounts and may even adopt dilatory tactics in the matter. In the circumstances it is obvious that realisation of this amount by taking execution proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure must plunge the indigent spouse into another lengthy and unpleasant litigation and what is more, the matrimonial Court will find it difficult, if not impossible, to decide the case satisfactorily or expeditiously. It will result in denial nf justice to the person in whose favour the order under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act has been made. 6. The question arises if the Courts are helpless and cannot make effective the legislative intention expressed in Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. I think the Courts are not helpless in the matter and can use their inherent jurisdiction to avoid such consequences. There is nothing in the Hindu Marriage Act which can prevent the Courts to exercise the inherent jurisdiction to advance the cause of justice. The Code of Civil Procedure contains no provision under which pendente lite maintenance and litigation expenses can be recovered without delay. As Chopra J. observed in another context (vide Sunder Mal v. Budh Ram, ILR 1955-4 Patiala 481). . . ""Courts exist for administering justice. In India every Court is a Court of equity as well as of law. For the administration of justice it is necessary that it should have powers to undo a wrong and do the right. It there is a specific law of procedure by which the Court is to be governed, that has to beSmt. Malkan Rani vs Krishan Kumar on 21 April, 1960 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/607623/ 2followed and justice administered in accordance with its provisions. But where the law is silent, every Court must be deemed to possess, as inherent in its very constitution, powers to Carry into effect the pur-pose for which it exists. A Code can hardly be expected to cover all possible eventualities for all times. The reason is that no rules can regulate for all time to come so as to make express provision against all inconveniences which are Infinite in number and so that their disposition shall express all the cases that may probably happen. So long as a particular procedure or action is not expressly prohibited, the Court can act according to justice, equity and good conscience. Mahmood J. in Narsing Das v. Mangal Dubey, ILK 5 All 163 says 'Courts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure is to be taken as prohibited unless it is expressly provided for by the Code, but on the converse principle that every procedure is to be understood as permissible until it is shown to be prohibited by the law. As a matter of general principle prohibitions cannot be presumed'. In places where and for cases to which the Civil Procedure Code applies, its Section 151 makes a legislative recognition of the inherent power of a Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice, or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. The Court does not derive that power from the section. On the other hand, the section only clarifies the position that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to circumscribe or otherwise affect the powers which are inherent in the very constitution of a Court."" The Court has to exercise this inherent power to advance the cause of Justice though in the process the indigent spouse must benefit. TRat benefit, however, is not the motive for the exercise of this inherent jurisdiction. The Courts after all are intended and are expected to conduct their proceedings equitably between the parties and can take all steps consistent with law to achieve this objective. 7. It was, however, argued on behalf of the husband that Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down the procedure for recovering the amounts due under orders made under Section 24 of the Act and impliedly excludes the recovery of such an amount by any other mode, I do not agree. Sec, 28 gives this right to a party to recover such an amount by taking execution proceedings but it does not affect the Court's power to exercise its jurisdiction equitably and in such a way as to prevent abuse of its process. Moreover as I have already said there is no procedure prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure for enforcing pendente lite maintenance and for payment of expenses of a litigation pending in the matrimonial Court. 8. If the defaulter has moved the matrimonial Court for any relief, then it is an obvious step to adjourn the case or to stay further proceedings till he complies with the orders made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In England the ecclesiastical Courts provided for such a maintenance and for costs of the defence (vide Kemp Welcb v. Kemp Welch and Crymes, 1910 Pro. 233). These Courts take adequate steps including an order staying further proceedings in the case to compel the defaulter to comply with such an order. In Clarke v. Clarke, 1891 Pro. 278, the matrimonial Court stayed further proceedings while in Lathom v. Latham and Cethin, (1861) 164 E. R. 1011, the Courts refused to make a nisi decree absolute. There is no reason why this power cannot be exercised in such circumstances in this country also.Smt.

327,"Punjab-Haryana High Court Janak Dulari vs Narain Dass on 8 September, 1958 Equivalent citations: AIR 1959 P H 50 Author: B Narain Bench: B Narain, D Falshaw, I Dua ORDER Bishan Narain, J. 1. This appeal has been filed by Janak Dulari under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act and arises out of her husband's application under Section 9 of the said Act for restitution of conjugal rights. The parties were admittedly married on 30-4-1945 at Nakodar (District Jullundur) and the present application was made on 10-11-1955 in Amritsar Courts. The wife objected to the jurisdiction of the Amritsar Court on the ground that the parties had last resided together at Gurdaspur and that she was residing at the time of the application at Palampur. The trial Court framed a preliminary issue regarding its jurisdiction and the Additional District Judge after recording evidence came to the conclusion that the parties had last resided together at Amritsar and therefore he had jurisdiction to hear the application. It is against this interlocutory decision that the present appeal has been filed. 2. Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with the jurisdiction of Court and it reads: ""Every petition under this Act shall be presented to the district court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnized or the husband and wife reside or last resided together"". In the present case the marriage was solemnized to the district of Jullundur but this application has been made in the Amritsar Court. Therefore the Court where the husband and wife reside or last resided together is the Court where the application would lift, It is common ground that at one time both parties resided together in Amritsar where the applicant is employed. The wife's case, however, is that she last resided together with her husband in the house of her sister's husband in Gurdaspur, and that therefore the Amritsar Court has no jurisdiction. Narain Das applicant is admittedly employed in the Medical College, Amritsar. It is common ground that after marriage the parties lived together at Amritsar from July 1955 to 13th October, 1955, when they separated. The husband's case is that his wife left him and went away to Gurdaspur while her case is that Narain Das gave her a beating on that day and she left for Gurdaspur. It is again common ground that the husband went to Gurdaspur on 14-10-1955, to fetch and that he stayed there till 16-10-1955. Ultimately he returned to Amritsar on 17-10-1955. The husband's case is that he was not allowed to see his wife by her relations while Janak Dulari's case is that reconciliation was brought about and that they lived together as husband and wife till the 16th, It is difficult to believe the story of reconciliation at any time during these three days as otherwise there would be no occasion for this petition for restitution of conjugal rights. It is not the case of Janak Dulari that any dispute arose between the parties after this alleged reconciliation. Even if Janak Dulari's version is accepted, the stay for three days in the house of her sister's husband cannot be considered as last residence' within the Act. The word 'reside' implies something moreJanak Dulari vs Narain Dass on 8 September, 1958 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1447018/ 1than a mere brief or flying visit, (vide Sardari Lal v. Mst. Kaushalya Devi 1956-58 Pun LR 562 : ((S) AIR 1957 Punj 84)). In the present case obviously the husband's visit to Gurdaspur was a brief and flying visit to bring about reconciliation and it was riot his purpose to ga to Gurdaspur and reside there particularly when ha Was employed in the Medical College, Amritsar, arid could not remain absent from there for any length of time. I have therefore, no hesitation in holding that the husband and wife last resided in Amritsar and not in Gurdaspur within Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act and the Amritsar Court has jurisdiction to hear the case. 3. The learned counsel for the appellant then raised two new points which were not raised in-the trial Court. As these points are law points involving the Court's jurisdiction, I allowed him to argue them. 4. The learned counsel argued that the plaint was not properly presented. It appears that the) application was presented to Senior Sub-Judge, Amritsar, who sent it to the District Judge, who) in his turn transferred it to the Additional District Judge, Amritsar. It is, therefore, clear that the application ultimately reached the District Judge who admittedly had jurisdiction to hear the application. He, however, transferred it to the Court of Additional District Judge. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the application was not presented to the proper Court. I, therefore, see no force in this contention and I reject it (vide Kishen Lal v. Jai Lal, ILR I Lah 158: (AIR 1919 Lah 27), and Shiv Nath Rai v. Lalfo Mal Madan Lal, AIR 1938 Lah 838.) 5. The next point raised is not free from difficulty. It is argued that an application under the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be heard by any Court other than the District Court which under Section 3 (b) of that Act means a principal civil Court of original jurisdiction. It is common ground that there is no 'city Court' in Amritsar nor has the State Government specified by notification any other civil Court which can deal with matters under the Hindu Marriage Act. The application was heard by the Additional District Judge, Amritsar. The contention is that the Punjab Courts Act does not mention a Court of Additional District Judge and a new Court cannot be created by the Government and, therefore, the proceedings taken by the Additional District Judge were without jurisdiction. After considering the provisions of the Punjab Courts Act, the Supreme Court in Kuldip Singh v. State of Punjab. 1956-58 Pun LR 595 : ((S) AIR 1956 SC 391), hid down that the Court of Additional Judge constitutes a distinct class of Court and that the Punjab Courts Act nowhere speaks of an Additional District Judge, It is also laid down that the Court of Additional Judge is not a division Court of the Court of District Judge. Thus the Punjab Courts Act does not contemplate a Court of Additional District judge. The Court of Additional District Judge, therefore, cannot be considered to be a Civil Court of original jurisdiction under the Hindu Marriage Act particularly when Section 20 lays down that there shall be only one District Judge in each district and Section 24 provides that the Court of District Judge shall be deemed to be district Court or principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district.Janak Dulari vs Narain Dass on 8 September, 1958 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1447018/ 2It is true that under Section 21 (2) an Additional Judge is authorised to discharge the functions of a District Judge and in the discharge of these functions he exercises the same powers as the District Judge but this section docs not refer to a Court of Additional District Judge and the Supreme Court has held that the Court of Additional Judge is a distinct Court. Speaking for myself I always consider the Court of Additional District Judge to be a Court of Additional Judge under the Punjab Courts Act and that when a case was transferred to it by the District Judge then the Additional District Judge exercised the same powers as the District Judge as provided in Section 21 (2) of the Punjab Courts Act. In view of some observations of the Supreme Court, I feel some difficulty in considering this position to be correct. The matter is important and in my opinion it, should be decided by a larger Bench. This point involves the following two questions : -- (1) Whether the Court of Additional District Judge can be considered to be the principal civil Court of original civil jurisdiction within Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act? (2) If not, can the District Judge transfer a case under the Hindu Marriage Act to the Court of Additional District Judge, and on such a transfer he would have jurisdiction to hear and decide the case? 6. Let the papers be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for orders. (The reference was heard by a Division Bench    consisting of Falshaw and Dua JJ., who passed the following order on 28-8-1958.) D. Falshaw, J.  7. In connection with an appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act XXV of 1955, which came before Bishan Narain, J., a question for jurisdiction arose which has been referred by him for decision by a larger Bench and has been formulated by him in the following two questions : -- (1) Whether the Court of 'Additional District Judge can be considered to be the principal civil Court of original civil jurisdiction within Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act? (2) If not, can the District Judge transfer a case under the Hindu Marriage Act to the Court of Additional District Judge, and on such a transfer he would have jurisdiction to hear and decide the ease? 8. Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act prescribes that every petition under the Act shall be presented to the district court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnized or the husband and wife reside or last resided together. In Section 3 (b) ""district court"" is defined as meaning, in any area for which there is a city 'civil court, that court, and in any other area the principal civil court of original jurisdiction, and includes any other civil courtJanak Dulari vs Narain Dass on 8 September, 1958 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1447018/ 3","['20', '3', '19', '24', '21', '9', '28']"

This appeal raises important questions relating to the construction of some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a piece of legislation, which is not noted for artistic or accurate draftsmanship. The appellant in this case fiied a petition in the Court of the District Judge, Halar, for restitution of conjugal rights against the respondent. On 3lst January, 1957, the said petition was dismissed. From the order of dismissal, an appeal was filed in the High Court. That appeal was dismissed. On 11th April, 1957, the respondent made an application purporting to do so under the provisions contained in Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for permanent alimony. That application was heard by the learned District Judge, Halar, who passed an order awarding a sum of Rs. 40/- per month as and by way of permanent alimony to the respondent from the date of the application, The appellant has filed this appeal from that order. 2. Mr. Chhaya, the learned advocate for the respondent, has raised a preliminary objection as regards the maintainability of this appeal. He contends that no appeal lies against the order made as 'aforesaid on the application of the respondent. The provisions relating to appeals are to be found in Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. That section runs as under: ""All decrees and orders made by the court in any proceeding under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decrees and orders of the court made in the exercise of its original civil Jurisdiction are enforced, and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force."" Mr. Chhaya contends that the order granting Rs. 40/- per month by way of permanent alimony is an order within the meaning of this section. He urges that an appeal can lie from such order only if such appeal is provided under any law for the time being in force. According to his submission, the law referred to in this connection is the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. He says that the provisions of the Code relating to appeals are to be found in Sections 96 and 101 and Order 43 Rule 1- Section 96 provides for appeals from original decrees. Section 104 and Order 43, Rule 1 provide for appeals from orders, He argues that the provisions of Section 104 and Order 43 Rule 1 are inapplicable to the order in question passed by the District Judge, Halar. Section 104 in terms provides that an appeal shall lie from the orders therein mentioned and that save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of the Code or by any law for the time being in force, from no other orders. An order granting permanent alimony is not one of the orders specified in Section 104. Order 43 Rule 1, provides for an appeal from the orders therein mentioned. An order awarding permanent allmony is not one of the orders mentioned in Order 43. He relied upon the definition of the term ""decree"" given in the Civil Procedure Code in order to show that the Order in question does not amount to a decree. Section 2, Sub-section (2) provides that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, the term ""decree' means the formal express ion of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court ex-pressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any ofKadia Harilal Purshottam vs Kadia Lilavati Gokaldas on 1 February, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1212030/ 1the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within Section 47 or Section 144, but is not to include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or any order of dismissal for default. The expression ""order"" has been defined in Section 2, subsection (14) to mean the formal expression of any decision of a Civil Court which is not a decree. He argues that the order passed by the District Judge, Halar, awarding permanent alimony does not amount to a decree within the meaning of Section 2, Sub-section (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.' He says that this order was passed on an application that was made after the suit for restitution of conjugal rights was disposed of. He submits that the order made is an order within the meaning of Section 2, Sub-section (14), and as no appeal is provided from such an order under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, no appeal lies therefrom and that the appeal that is filed is incompetent in law. He relies upon a decision of a single Judge of the Bombay High Court reported in Prithyirajsinghji Mansinghji v. Bai Shivprabha Kumari, 62 Bom LR 47: (AIR 1960 Bom 315). In that case it was held that the words ""may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"" refer to the appeals provided for under the Code of Civil Procedure. It was there held that Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, did not provide any appeal against every order made by a Court In proceedings under the Act, 'but against only Such of them as fall within the definition of the term 'decree' as defined in Section 2, Sub-section (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, or with legard to which an appeal is provided under the Code. In that case, the contention that the words ""under any law for the time being in force"" were applicable merely to the procedure in cases where an appeal lay, was negatived. He also relied upon a decision of the Andhra High Court reported in B. Saraswalhi v. B. Krishna Murlhy, AIR 1960 Andh Pra 30. In that case, a Division Bench of that Court held that Section 28 by itself did not confer any right of appeal and that the words ""may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"" conveyed the idea that an appeal could be filed against decrees and orders if there was provision therefor under any law and that one had to fall back on the Civil Procedure Code in this connection. In that case the Court was dealing with an appeal from an order refusing to grant interim maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Court held that such an order under Section 24 did not fall within the ambit either of Section 104 or Order 43 and that no appeal lay therefrom. 3. The argument advanced before us by Mr. Chhaya proceeds on the footing that the expression ""decrees"" and ""orders"" appearing in Section 28 mean decrees and orders as defined in the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in express terms lays down that the expression ""decree"" when used in the said Code means ""the formal expression of an adjudication which as far as regards the Court expressing it conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final"". Order 4 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that every suit shall be instituted by presenting a plaint to the Court or such officer as it appoints in this behalf. In Sir Dinshah Mulla's Code of Civil Procedure, 12th Edition, at page 6 under the head ""In the Suit"" are set Out various proceedings which arc not instituted by presenting a plaint with the result that the orders made therein do not constitute decrees within, the meaning of the Code. No proceeding under the Act has to be instituted by presenting a plaint and the expression 'decree* as defined in Section 2,Kadia Harilal Purshottam vs Kadia Lilavati Gokaldas on 1 February, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1212030/ 2Sub-section (2) of the Code will not cover an adjudication in proceedings instituted under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The expressions ""decrees"" and ""orders"" appearing in Sec- 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, have to be read and understood in the light of the other provisions of the Act itself. Section 28 follows upon Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 which refer respectively to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, a decree for judicial separation, a decree of nullity of marriage for contravention of the provisions of Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5, a decree of nullity of marriage on the grounds set out in Section 12, and a decree of divorce. Sections 24, 25 and 26 provide for orders. Under Section 24, provision is made for orders for maintenance pendente lite and for expenses of the proceedings. Section 25 deals with orders for permanent maintenance. Section 26 deals with orders in connection with the custody, maintenance and education of minor children. When Section 28 refers to appeals from decrees and orders, it refers to decrees mentioned in the sections referred to hy me above and the orders mentioned in the sections referred to above. The right of appeal is a statutory right. In order that a party may have a right of appeal, that right has to be conferred by legislation. If the words used in Section 28 ""may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"" mean that an appeal would only lie in these cases where some other law lays down that such appeal can be preferred, then the result would be that we would have to look to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in order to consider whether any appeal is provided under the Code in respect of decrees and orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. No other, law is pointed out which confers any right of appeal. As we have already indicated above, the Civil Procedure Code provides for appeals from decrees as defined in Section 2, Sub-section (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The decrees passed under Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, do not come within the definition of ""decrees"" under the Code of Civil Procedure. The orders passed under Sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act are not orders falling within Section 104 and Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If this interpretation is accepted, the result would be that there would not be any decree or any order under any of the aforesaid sections which would be appealable. This could not possibly be the intention of the legislature. The section is intended to deal inter alia with the subject of appeals from decrees and orders passed under the Act. If there was no law under which an appeal would lie from any decree or Order passed under the Act, the provision in that connection would be futile and devoid of meaning. By this Act the legislature has conferred special rights and has provided special remedies. The Courts before which such proceedings could be taken and the way in which such proceedings may be initiated have been laid down in the Act. It would be reasonable to assume that when the legislature was considering the question of appeals from decrees and orders passed under the Act it would provide by the Act itself for such appeals. In the absence of any other legislation providing for appeals from both decrees and orders passed under the Act, there would be greater reason for the legislature to provide for it by the Act itself. In our view, on a true construction of Section 28 the right of appeal from all decrees and orders is conferred by Section 28 itself. No doubt, the language of the section is not very happy. The words ""may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"" are capable of bearing the meaning which Mr. Chhaya desires us to give. If we give such a meaning to those words, the provisions relating to appeal are liable to be rendered nugatory. That could not possibly be the intention of the legislature. It could not be the intention of the legislature to confer a right of appeal against decrees and orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 by reference to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. There is in fact no provision in the Code or in any other law under which any appeal could be filed from any orders passed under the HinduKadia Harilal Purshottam vs Kadia Lilavati Gokaldas on 1 February, 1961 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1212030/ 3","['26','10','24', '12', '2', '14', '28', '5', '25']"

No.338/2008 for reference to the larger Bench. Though we shall take note of these questions at a later and more appropriate stage, we would like to point out at the outset that the issues raised can be put in two compartments, viz., (i) what is the status of marriage under Hindu Law when one of the parties to the marriage is below the age of 18 years prescribed under Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Section 2 (a) of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred as the „PCM Act) and (ii) when the girl is minor (but the boy has attained theCourt On Its Own Motion (Lajja ... vs State on 27 July, 2012 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41067986/ 1age of marriage as prescribed) whether the husband he can be regarded as the lawful guardian of the minor wife and claim her custody in spite of contest and claim by the parents of the girl. What is the effect of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006? 2. After the aforesaid reference was made, as some other petitions involving same questions came up for adjudication, they were also directed to be listed along with Writ Petition (Crl.) No.338/2008. That is the raison detre that all these petitions were heard together. We would be in a better position to appreciate the issues involved if facts in each of these cases are taken note of in the first instance. Writ Petition (Crl.) No.338/2008 3. A letter was addressed by Smt. Lajja Devi wife of Sh.Het Ram, R/o Village Mohra, P.L. Jagat, P.S. Musa Jhag, District Badayun, Uttar Pradesh to the Honble the Chief Justice of this Court. In the letter, it was alleged by Smt. Lajja Devi that her daughter named Ms.Meera, who was around 14 years of age (date of birth being 6.7.1995) was kidnapped by Promod, Vinod, Satish, Manoj S/o Shri Raj Mal. This kidnapping is purported to have taken place when Ms. Meera had visited Delhi to meet the brother-in- law of the Complainant at A- 113, Rajiv Nagar Extension, Near Village Begumpur, Delhi-110086. On the basis of the said information, an FIR bearing No.113/2008 under Section 363 IPC had been registered at P.S. Sultanpuri on 21st February, 2008 against the aforesaid accused persons. 4. This letter was treated as a Writ Petition and was placed before the appropriate Bench on 14th March, 2008 whereupon notice was issued to the State directing it to file the Status Report. Four Status Reports have been filed by the Police from time to time. These Reports are dated 02.4.2008, 12.5.2008, 11.5.2008 and 11.7.2008. The local Police, as a consequence of registration of this FIR, had arrested Shri Charan Singh from Village Sakatpur District Badayun, U.P. wherefrom the minor girl Ms.Meera was also recovered, as both of them were living together. The girl had made a statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini Courts Delhi that she had gone along with the accused Charan Singh of her own free will as her Uncle and Aunt were marrying her against her wishes. Charan Singh was taken in Judicial Custody on 8.6. 2008. Admittedly, Ms. Meera was a minor, and in all probabilities is aged around 13 years and a month as on that date. 5. Initially, Ms. Meera refused to go along with her parents, her natural guardians, on the ground that they intended were intending to marry her off with some other person. She was, thus, sent to Nirmal Chhaya in judicial custody. However, when the matter came up for hearing on 31.7.2008, she desired to reside with her parents on the assurance given by the parents that they would not marry her to someone else. 6. When the matter was taken up for arguments on 31.7.2008, the aforesaid facts were taken note of which points out that Ms. Meera was not abducted by Shri Charan Singh. On the contrary, she went with him on her own accord and they got married. However, she was not only minor but even less than 15 years of age. She had initially expressed her apprehension in joining her parental home. OnCourt On Its Own Motion (Lajja ... vs State on 27 July, 2012 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41067986/ 2the other hand, her husbands family wanted to have the custody of Ms. Meera as her husband was in judicial custody. In this backdrop, the question arose as to what would be the status of such a marriage. Can it be treated as a valid marriage? Or was it the voidable by law? Or it was simply an illegal marriage not recognized. The question of entitlement of husband to have the custody of a minor person with whom he married could depend upon the answer to the aforesaid question. Crl.M.C. No.1001/2011 7. This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking quashing of FIR registered against the petitioner No.2 under Sections 363/366/376/465/467/494/497/120B and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. It is stated that the petitioner No.1 had of her own will joined the company of the petitioner No.2 and got married with him according to Hindu rites and ceremonies on 4.3.2010. However, the respondent No.2, father of the petitioner No.1, lodged a missing report on 5.3.2010 in the Police Station. It is alleged that in the said missing report he had stated that the petitioner No.1 aged 20 years was missing. Thereafter, in April, 2010 he filed habeas corpus petition taking the stand that the petitioner No.1 was minor and she had been married by the respondent no.2 to someone else at Rajasthan when she returned from her in laws from Rajasthan to Delhi. She was enticed away by the petitioner No.2. The notice was issued in the said writ petition and production of the petitioner No.1 was ordered. The Police recovered her and produced before the Court on 19.4.2010. She stated that she had married the petitioner No.2 on her own accord and without any pressure and wanted to live with the petitioner No.2, who was her husband. In view of the conflicting claims about her age, direction was given to the I.O. to verify her age. The Court sent the petitioner No.1 to Nirmal Chhaya Nari Niketan for protective custody. Ossification test was conducted and the age of the petitioner No.1 was found between 17-19 years. The respondent No.2, father of the petitioner No.1, had produced the school leaving certificate which showed her date of birth as 3.3.1993 and on this basis, she was 17 years of age on the date when the parties allegedly solemnised marriage. The father of the petitioner No.1 wanted her custody. However, she gave the statement that she would like to stay at Nari Niketan rather than joining her parents. In view of this statement, the Court sent the petitioner No.1 to Nari Niketan till the time she attained the age of majority vide orders dated 31.5.2010. However, at the same time the petitioner No.2 was allowed to meet her twice a week at least for two hours on each occasion vide orders dated 29.10.2011. As per the school leaving certificate she completed the age of 18 years on 3.3.2011. She was, thus, released from Nari Niketan and she decided to join the company of the petitioner No.2 and has been living with him. However, on 25.2.2011 the petitioner No.2 was arrested in the FIR No.31/2011, PS Dabri under Sections 363/366/376/465/467/494/ 497/120-B/506 IPC. This FIR was registered on the basis of the directions given by the learned MM upon the complaint filed by the respondent No.2 on 3.4.2010. It is, in these circumstances, both the petitioners filed the aforesaid petition seeking quashing of the FIR. WP (Crl.) No.821/2008 8.

This appeal is under S. 19(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, against the order passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bangalore, dated 24-10-1990 in M.C. No. 1019 of 1987 rejecting the appellant's petition filed u/S. 13(1)(1-a) and (1-b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. A few facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are as follows: The appellant is the wife and the respondent is the husband. They were married on 30-8-1974 at Bangalore as per Hindu customs. After the marriage, they lived together at Wardha in Maharashtra where the respondent was working as a Lecturer. Out of the said wedlock 2 sons were born. The first son, Bharath was born on 24-11-1976 and the second son, Prathivi, was born on 22-8-1978. In the year 1980 they shifted to Thirupathi as the respondent got a job as a Lecuter in the S.V. University College, At the time of marriage, the petitioner was a B.Sc. graduate. After the marriage the petitioner completed her degree course in Library Science in 1975-76 and got the degree B.Lib. Science. In the year 1981-82 she completed post-graduate course in Library Science and acquired M. Lib. Science degree. After completing her studies the appellant again joined the respondent at Thirupathi and lived there for some time. It is alleged that as the respondent stated ill-treating the petitioner; always criticising her; referring to her parents and doubting the character of her sisters. He used to address her in filthy language and illtreating her in the presence of relatives and her friends. Further, the respondent is excessively irritable and suspicious. Though the respondent is educated, he did not allow her to meet her friends. The suspicious nature of the respondent and the ill-treatment with cruelty forced the petitioner to leave the company of the respondent to join her parents with her children in the month of October 1983. Even after joining her parents, she was hopeful that the respondent would make honest efforts to take her and their children back. But, he refused to do so. Therefore, the respondent was also guilty of constructive obsertion. Hence, she got issued a legal notice dated 27-1-1987 to the respondent. As there was no possibility of re-union, the petitioner filed the petition seeking a decree of divorce by dissolving her marriage with the respondent. 3. The respondent/husband filed his objections denying the allegations made by the appellant. He admitted the relationship and the fact of having 2 children by the marriage. But, he denied the allegation that he used to ill-treat her. He had not ill-treated her at any time. His case is that though he treated her with love and affection, the appellant herself developed an indifferent attitude towards him. The appellant alone is responsible for her withdrawal from his company. He has also stated that the appellant's intention to seek divorce is to join one of her sisters who is married to an Austrian and to stay in Austria. Further reason given by the respondent is that he cannot give up the Hindu way of life and adjust to the life of the appellant's sister and her parents. In his statement of objections, the respondent also denied the other averments made by the petitioner as incorrect.Smt. Roopa Reddy vs Prabhakar Reddy on 4 June, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/322767/ 14. On the basis of the pleadings, the Court below raised the following points for consideration : ""Point No. 1: Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty? Point No. 2:    Whether the respondent is guilty of constructive desertion? Point No. 3:    Whether the petitioner is entitled to a Decree of Divorce?  In support of their rival contentions, both parties led evidence, both oral and documentary. The trial Court upon appreciation of the entire evidence, found that the attitude of the respondent towards his wife/appellant was always affectionate. It was he who had encouraged the appellant to study Library Science and enabled her to take the M. Lib Science; and in none of his letters he expressed any ill-will or criticised the way of living of the appellant. So observing, the Court below held that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent treated her with cruelty. Regarding constructive desertion, the Court below found that the appellant failed to establish that the respondent deserted her; but, on the other hand, the appellant herself wanted to put an end to the marital relationship. While observing so, the Court held that the appellant is not entitled for a decree of divorce. Aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court below, the appellant has preferred this appeal contending, inter alia, that, when both parties live separately, the Court below should have granted a decree of divorce as there is no chance of re-conciliation and that, when the conduct of the respondent has resulted in an act of desertion, the Court, below should have granted the relief, viz., decree of divorce. 5. In support of their rival contentions, counsel appearing for both sides addressed their arguments. As required under the Hindu Marriage Act efforts were made by the Court to bring about re-conciliation. Both parties are educated and capable of understanding the effect of dissolution upon their children. The importance of striving together for the welfare of their children and their proper custody was explained to the parties. But the attempt proved to he futile. 6. During the pendency of this appeal, we directed the appellant to bring her 2 children. The respondent was also present. On our querry the children submitted that they would like to be under joint custody of their parents. The respondent stated that he can give better education to his children at Thirupathi, since he is working in the University and entitled for certain benefits. Appellant did not object to such a suggestion. 7. On 12-10-1992 the parties filed a joint application under Order VI Rule 17 read with S. 151, CPC seeking amendment to the main petition filed by the appellant u/S. 13(1)(ia) and (ib) to be convened into one under S. 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The proposed amendment reads as follows: ""Proposed Amendment All the averments made in paras 4 to 8 of the said M.C.

Para 4: Both the Petitioner and the respondent submit that they arc living separately since October 1981 continuously and they have not been able to live together as husband and wife eversince then. Para 5 : The Petitioner and the respondent have agreed not to make any allegation against each other in this petition. Para 6: Both petitioner and the respondent submit that they have mutually agreed to make this application for dissolution of their marriage solemnised on 30-8-74 by decree of divorce and they further submit that their mutual consent is not influenced by any external threat or influence of coercion. The prayer made in the main petition may be deleted entirely and in its place the following lines may be permifted to be substituted. Wherefore both parties respectfully pray that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to pass a decree of divorce by dissolving the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent solemnised on 30-8-74 and grant such other relief as this Court may deem fit in the circumstances of the case, allowing this petition."" The said application is supported by the affidavits of both parties. Subsequent to this application both parties appeared again before the Court and reiterated that there is no possibility of reconciliation and they agree for divorce by mutual consent as the same will be in the interest of both parties and the children. They also submitted that there is no external threat, influence or collusion behind the proposal of the divorce by mutual consent. 8. In addition to the statements of both parties, learned counsel appearing for both sides submitted their arguments in support of the application seeking decree of divorce by mutual consent. According to them, in view of S. 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act there is no impediment to grant decree of divorce even at this stage when both parties have expressed their consent. In support of this contention, they have placed reliance on some authorities which will be referred to hereafter. 9. The question that arises for consideration is whether in the facts and circumstances of (he case the parties are entitled to seek divorce by consent at the appellate stage without there being a formal application under S. 13-B before the Family Court? 10. From the material on record it is clear that both parlies who are educated and are in a position to understand the concept of marriage and their responsibilities as husband and wife. Their feelings and temperament make it apparent that no amount of persua-tion for reconciliation will be fruitful. In the circumstances the only alternative is to consider whether it is permissible to grant divorce by mutual consent.Smt.

Petitioner Manish Singh was a tenant under respondent No. 2/Sh.Ram Sanjeewan Gupta and fell in love with his daughter Suman, respondent No. 4 herein, a young girl of 16 years. Both eloped and got married on 17th May, 2005 at Arya Samaj Mandir, Jamuna Bazar, Delhi. They co-habited and lived together after marriage in Delhi and in Bihar. 2. Petitioner alleges that Sh.

Petitioner thereupon was constrained to file the present petition. Notice in the petition was issued on 30th September, 2005, returnable on 19th October, 2005 with a direction to produce Suman to ascertain if she was being detained against her wishes. Suman appeared in Court in response to the directions. She stated that she was in love with petitioner. She left the parental home of her own to get married. Petitioner did not take or entice her and marriage was her suggestion. She confirms the factum of marriage, co-habitation and living with the petitioner and her in-laws. She, However, stated that since September, 2005 she had been living with her parents and had thought about the entire matter and her future life. She does not now wish to live with the petitioner or resume co-habitation with him. Page 2372 3. Petitioner and Suman were permitted to meet each other in our Chamber without any one else being present, to decide their future course of action.

In March, 2003, he lodged a missing person report in respect of his daughter Kumari Lalita, followed by an FIR in April, 2003 alleging that she had been kidnapped by one Prabhu on 26th April, 2003. FIR No. 217/03 was registered under Section 363 IPC, Police Station Sarojini Nagar. Notice was issued in the petition and a direction given to the respondents for production of Kumari Lalita. State machinery had been set in motion to trace Kumari Lalita. Wireless messages, hue and cry notices, photographs were telecasted on Doordarshan. Seven police teams were dispatched to Bihar to carry out raids at the residence of Prabhu in Bihar. Proceedings for declaring him a proclaimed offender were also initiated. Despite monitoring and efforts by police, the run away couple could not be traced and Prabhu apprehended. 5. On 9th September, 2004, Kumari Lalita appeared in court of her own. Kumari Lalita stated that she had solemnized marriage with Prabhu of her own accord in a temple at Delhi on 26th April, 2003. They cohabited together. She stayed at different places in Bihar with her in laws. She stated that she was neither forced nor taken away. She had married Prabhu of her own choice. An interim direction that Prabhu be not arrested was issued. Their marriage had been performed in a temple. She claimed to be 19 years old. She gave birth to a male child on 18th March, 2004. 6. Petitioner initially claimed that his daughter was 14 years old with 6th May, 1993 as date of birth as per school leaving certificate. Kumari Lalita claimed that she was 19 years old. Ossification test was directed to be carried out to determine her age. As per the medico legal report furnished, her age was estimated between 16 to 18 years. By her physical appearance also, she now appears to us to be around 18 years of age. 7. With the passage of time, petitioner and his wife appear reconciled to accept the marriage entered into by Lalita, as a fait accompali especially with the birth of a child. Petitioner and his wife offered to provide shelter and assistance to young couple to enable them to settle in life. In the meanwhile, Prabhu, husband of Lalita stated that he had taken on rent a room in Okhla Phase-II and was earning Rs. 100/- per day by vending vegetables. In these circumstances, Lalita was directed to be released from Nirmal Chaya to live with her husband and avail of the offer of support as given by the petitioner Page 2373 and his wife. The case was adjourned for a period of six months. Interim stay against further investigation and arrest of Prabhu in the case continued. 8. On 8th August, 2005, we appointed Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, Advocate as an amices Curiae to provide legal assistance to the couple to proceed further with the matter for protection of their interest. Crl.M.10400/2005 was then moved by the petitioner for quashing of FIR No. 217/2003. Statement of Lalita had already been recorded where she stated that she was neither enticed nor forced. She had left parental home to get married to Prabhu. It would be seen that she would have been over around 17 years when she married Prabhu. Petitioner, Ram Ladle Chaturvedi also stands reconciled to the marriage of the couple and states that he does not want to prosecute the complaint and in fact has moved Crl.M.10400/2005 for quashing of the FIR.Manish Singh vs State Govt Of Nct And Ors. on 7 December, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1950248/ 29. In these circumstances, continuation of criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 217/03 under section 363 IPC Police Station Sarojini Nagar would be an exercise in futility. Besides, it would also be detrimental to the matrimonial life of the couple and of the infant. Lalita being around 17 years of age, on the verge of majority, having reached the age of discretion, had accompanied Prabhu of her own volition without any kind of enticement or inducement or force from any one. There was, thus, no taking away or enticing of a minor out of the keeping of a lawful guardian. Essential ingredients of the offence of kidnapping are missing. Reference may be made to S. Varadarajan v. State of Madras reported at 1965 Supreme Court 942 where the husband was held not guilty of kidnapping when the wife, a college going girl on the verge of majority had left the parental home of her own accord, to marry him, without any threat or inducement. This is a fit case for quashing of FIR in exercise of jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. Accordingly, FIR No. 217/03 under Section 363 IPC P.S.Sarojini Nagar and all the consequential proceedings arising thereto are quashed. We record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by the amices Curiae and other counsel. 10. We find increasing number of habeas corpus petitions being filed by the parents/guardians for production of their wards, who leave their parental houses in these ""Run away Marriages"". While the parents of the couples go through agony, the couples are on the run with husband being accused of kidnapping and/or rape. 11. The court while dealing with a Habeas Corpus Petition is required to ensure that the person whose production is sought is not illegally detained. For this purpose, the court ascertains whether the person is being detained against his/her wishes or is otherwise illegally detained and gives directions, as required. In cases, where a minor girl after meeting her parents and/or on reflection has second thoughts about her marriage or escapade, her custody is restored to parents as in the first case. Difficulty arises in cases where the minor girl has entered into matrimonial alliance and is steadfast in her resolve to continue to cohabit with the partner of her choice. At times, the girl is even in family way. The situation becomes difficult with parents of girl either on Page 2374 account of cast, differences or groom not matching their social standing or expectation are bent upon breaking the alliance. They continue to press the charges of abduction or kidnapping. 12. This Bench had occasion to deal with such cases in writ petitions being WP(Crl.) 942/2005-Ravi Kumar v. The State and Anr., WP(Crl) 1446/2005-Shikha Sharma v. The State and Anr. and WP(Crl) 1369/2005-Phoola Devi v. The State and Ors. reported at 2005 VIII AD (DELHI) 256. The girls between the age of 16 to 18 years had left their homes and got married with persons of their choice. The Bench held that girls could not be made to stay in the remand homes against their wishes unless their presence was required for legal proceedings or under a statute. The girls were steadfast in their resolve to live with their spouses. The complainant and the petitioners therein had stated that they were not interested in prosecution of the complaint. The girls were released from Nirmal Chaya/Nari Niketan, remand homes and permitted to cohabit with their husbands.Manish Singh vs State Govt Of Nct And Ors. on 7 December, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1950248/ 3",['3']

Suprova Burman And Anr. on 11 July, 1988 Equivalent citations: AIR 1989 Cal 120, (1989) 1 CALLT 104 HC, 93 CWN 102 Author: A Bhattacharjee Bench: A Bhattacharjee, B L Jain JUDGMENT A.M. Bhattacharjee, J. 1. The matrimonial proceeding under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, giving rise to this appeal, -was initiated by the husband-appellant against the wife-respendent for a declaration that the marriage was a nullity because of the under-age of the appellant and, in the alternative, for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of adultery, cruelty and desertion on the part of the wife. The petition which was thus a composite one under Section 24 as well as Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act has however been dismissed which has led the husband to file this appeal. The learned counsel for the appellant. Mr. Tapan Dutta, who has argued the appeal with singular ability and persistence, has, in his endeavour to assail the order, made a strenuous attempt to do so on an additional ground, namely, that the marriage between the parties having found to have been broken down irretrievably and irreparably ought to have been dissolved by a decree of divorce on that ground also. 2. Such a ground for divorce because of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage was, however, not specifically taken in the pleadings nor put in the issues nor has been put forward in the memorandum of appeal in this Court. And even conceding that such a ground, if borne out by the materials on record, can be taken into consideration without specific articulation in the pleadings or the issues or the memorandum, we are afraid that our matrimonial laws have not yet been made broad enough to warrant dissolution of marriage on the sole ground of irretrievable breakdown without more. 3. The observation of the Supreme Court, while affirming a decree for divorce, in Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan, to the effect that ""this marriage has broken down and the parties can no longer live together as husband and wife; if such is the case, it is better to close the chapter"", has given rise to an impression, erroneous though, that the Supreme Court has ruled irretrievable breakdown of marriage to be, by itself, a ground for dissolution. As would be evident from the provisions of Section 34(1) of the Special Marriage Act corresponding to Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, a matrimonial court has been empowered to decree reliefs under the Act only if the court is satisfied that ""any of the grounds"" as specified in the Act ''exists""; ""but not otherwise"" and, therefore, no court can add new grounds for divorce by its judicid fiat. The above observation of the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani (supra), having very often been read divorced from the context, has really been misread. That was a case where a husband filed a petition for divorce, not on the ground of irretrievable breakdown, but on the precise statutory ground as specified in Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage; Act, namely, non-restitution of conjugal rights between the parties for one year or more in spite of a decree for restitution to that effect and the question which was being considered by the Supreme Court was as to whether a husband, who has taken no steps to comply with a decree for restitution passed against him was disentitled from invoking Section 13(1A)(ii) and to obtain divorce thereunder on the ground that he would thereby be ""taking advantage of his own wrong"" within theHarendra Nath Burman vs Sm. Suprova Burman And Anr. on 11 July, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/202656/ 1meaning of Section 23(1)(a). The Supreme Court answered the question in the negative and, while affirming the decree for divorce on the ground specified in Section 13(1A)(ii), the learned Judges have observed further that their Lordships have done so ""without any mental compunction because it is evident that for whatever be the reasons, this marriage has broken down and the parties can no longer live together as husband and wife, and if such is the case, it is better to close the chapter."" It is, therefore, clear that the ground on which the dissolution of the marriage was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani (supra) was a ground specified in Section 13(1A) and not irreparable breakdown of marriage and, therefore, the observation extracted above cannot in any way be treated as any authority for the view that the Supreme Court has ruled that irretrievable breakdown, by itself and without more, would be a ground of dissolution of marriage. 4. That irretrievable breakdown of marriage, by itself, is not a ground for dissolution of marriage, under the Hindu Marriage Act is irresistibly clear from the 71st Report of the Law Commission of India on ""Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 -- Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage as a Ground of Divorce"", submitted in April, 1979, where the Law Commission has recommended insertion of several new provisions in the Hindu Marriage Act, as Section 13C etc., providing for divorce on such ground But neither Parliament nor any State Legislature has taken up the matter in right earnest and no amendment to that effect has yet been made in the relevant enactment. The same is the position under the Special Marriage Act, whereunder also irretriveable breakdown, of marriage, by itself, has not yet been made a ground for divorce. 5. Even before the observations of the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani, (supra), extracted hereinabove, Judges in the various High Courts have almost unhesitatingly expressed their preference for the view that where the marriage has for all practical purposes become defunct de facto, the Court should be empowered to declare it to be defunct de jure. For example, in the Delhi Full Bench decision in Ram Kali v. G.opal, ILR (1971) 1 Delhi 6, Khanna, C.J., (as he then was), observed that ""it would not be practical and realistic, indeed it would be unreasonable and inhuman, to compel the parties to keep up the facade of marriage even though the rift between them is complete and there are no prospects of their ever living together as husband and wife."" This Delhi Full Bench decision in Ram Kali (supra) has been approved by the Supreme Court in Dharmendrav. Usha, . But what is to be noted is that, notwithstanding all these observations, the decree for divorce in both the decisions was made, not on the ground of any irreparable breakdown simpliciter, but on the ground specified in Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, namely, non-resumption of cohabitation for the requisite period after passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights between the parties. To take another example, in Akkamma v. Jagannadhan, , a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has observed that a marriage which has irretrievably broken down should not be allowed to continue and that a marriage buried in fact should also be buried in law; but there again the decree for divorce was granted not on the ground of such breakdown, but on the ground of adultery which might have brought about such breakdown. 6. But one thing, however, deserves to be noted. Even though irretrievable breakdown simpliciter has not precisely been made a ground of dissolution of marriage as yet under the Special Marriage Act or the Hindu Marriage Act, the concept thereof has nevertheless entered in the divorce jurisdiction under those enactments. For, even where the ground put forward is adultery, cruelty,Harendra Nath Burman vs Sm. Suprova Burman And Anr. on 11 July, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/202656/ 2desertion or the like and the court is satisfied as to the existence of any of those grounds, the Court, before granting any relief on such grounds, is, both under Section 34(2) of the Special Marriage Act and Section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, under a mandatory obligation to ""make"", whenever possible, ""every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties"" and to grant relief only when such reconciliation is not possible. In other words, the existence of any such ground alone would not justify a decree of divorce unless the court is further satisfied that the ground has wrecked the marriage beyond reconciliation or repair. But even then, the ground for dissolution is not the ""irreparable breakdown"", but one or more of the grounds specified in the relevant enactment which might have resulted in such a breakdown. 7. Then again. Section 27(2) of the Special Marriage Act and Section 13(1A) of the Hindu Marriage Act providing for divorce on the ground of non-resumption of cohabitation for a period of one year or more after the passing of a decree for judicial separation or for restitution of conjugal rights have, in a sense recognised the concept of breakdown of marriage, the rationale behind those provisions being the presumption that non-resumption of cohabitation for the requisite period demonstrates breakdown of the marriage beyond repair. But there again, the ground for dissolution is not breakdown simpliciter, but the post-decree non-resumption of marital relation for the requisite period It is true that both Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act and Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act provide for divorce by mutual consent where the parties have been living separately for at least one year and that they have not been able to live together. This again without doubt has brought in the concept of breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce. But there again, the breakdown, by itself, has not been made a ground of dissolution, but what would warrant such a dissolution are the parties failing to live together and living separately for one year and their mutual consent to dissolve the marriage. We must, therefore, conclude, as we cannot but, that mere breakdown of the marriage, however irretrievable, is not, by itself and without more, any ground for dissolution of the marriage as yet under our matrimonial law. 8. The ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in Reynold Rajamani, would clearly support the view that we are taking. It has been ruled there (at p. 1263) with reference to the provisions of the Divorce Act, 1869, that ""when a legislative provision specifies the grounds on which divorce may be granted, they constitute the only conditions on which the court has jurisdiction to grant divorce"" and that ""if grounds need to be added to those already specifically set forth in the legislation, that is the business of the Legislature and not of the courts"" and accordingly the prayer for a decree of divorce on the ground of ""mutual consent"" was rejected, as the Divorce Act of 1869, unlike Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act of 1954 or Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, does not specify ""mutual consent"" as a ground of divorce. The Divorce Act no doubt specifies the grounds of divorce, but unlike Section 34(1)(f) of the Special Marriage Act 6r Section 23(1)(e) of the Hindu Marriage Act, does not specifically provide that decrees can be granted on those grounds only ""but not otherwise"", and if in spite of the absence of such negative prohibition, the ratio in Reynold Rajamani (supra) is that no divorce can be granted except on grounds expressly specified, the ratio will a fortiori apply to divorces under the Special Marriage Act or the Hindu Marriage Act where such negative provisions stare at the face.Harendra Nath Burman vs Sm.

The second  marriage  was  a  valid  marriage according to  the custom  of the  nata marriage prevalent in the  Telli   community  which  requires  the  following  twoGopal Lal vs State Of Rajasthan on 30 January, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1063154/ 1essential ceremonies:-           (a)  that the  husband should  take a pitcher full                of water  from the  head of  the  prospective                wife, and           (b)   that the  wife  should  wear  chura  by  the                husband.      The prosecution  through PWs.  2, 3,  4  and  5  having proved that  these ceremonies have been duly performed, that there was  such a  custom which requires the said ceremonies having been  admitted by  the defence  witnesses 3 and 5 and the validity of the first marriage not having been disputed, Section 494  I.P.C. applies  in terms and the appellant must be  held   to  have  committed  the  offence  of  Bigamy  as contemplated by section 494 I.P.C. [1176A-E]      2. The  combined effect  of section  17  of  the  Hindu Marriage Act  and section  494 I.P.C.  is that when a person contracts a  second marriage  after the coming into force of the said  Act while the first marriage is subsisting, such a person commits the offence of bigamy. [1174 E] Section 17  of the  Hindu Marriage  Act, 1955  makes it absolutely clear  that the  provision  has  to  be  read  in harmony and  conjunction with  the provisions of section 494 I.P.C., the essential ingredients of which are: (i) that the accused spouse  must have contracted the first marriage (ii) that while  the first  marriage was  subsisting  the  spouse concerned must  have contracted a second marriage, and (iii) that both  the marriages must be valid in the sense that the necessary 1172 ceremonies  required  by  the  personal  law  governing  the parties had been duly performed and (iv) the second marriage must have  become void  by virtue  of the  fact that  it had taken place  in the life time of one of the spouses. [1173F- H]      3. Where a spouse contracts a second marriage while the first marriage  is still  subsisting  the  spouse  would  be guilty of  bigamy under  section 494, I.P.C. if it is proved that the  second marriage  was a valid one in the sense that the necessary  ceremonies required  by law or by custom have been actually  performed. The voidness of the marriage under section 17  of the  Hindu Marriage Act is in fact one of the essential ingredients  of section  494  because  the  second marriage will  became void only because of the provisions of section  17  of  the  Hindu  Marriage  Act.  Therefore,  the contention that  the second  marriage being void section 494 I.P.C. will have no application is not correct. [1175F-G]      Bhaurao  Shankar   Lokhande  and   Anr.  v.

Jain for the Respsondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J.-This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment of the Rajasthan High Court by which the conviction of the appellant under Section 494 I.P.C. and sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2,000/- have been upheld. The facts of this case have been detailed in the judgments of the courts below and it is not necessary to repeat them. Suffice it to say that the accused Gopal Lal married the complainant Kanchan sometime in the year, 1963 and a child was born out of this wedlock. Soon thereafter the parties appeared to have fallen out and parted company. While the first marriage was subsisting Gopal Lal contracted a second marriage which according to the custom prevalent amongst Tellis is a valid marriage commonly known as nata marriage. This marriage was contracted on 20th of March, 1969. The complainant Kanchan, the first wife having come to know about this marriage filed a complaint on the 22nd March, 1969, on the basis of which appellant was prosecuted and ultimately convicted as mentioned above. Mr. A. N. Mulla, learned counsel for the appellant, had submitted two points before us. In the first place it was contended that in view of the provisions of Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the second marriage being a void marriage, the provisions of Section 494 I.P.C. are not attracted at all. We have given our anxious consideration to this argument but we are of the opinion that the argument is wholly untenable. Section 494 runs thus: ""Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. Exception-This section does not extend to any person whose marriage with such husband or wife has been declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction, nor to any person who contracts a marriage during the life of a former husband or wife, if such husband or wife, at the time of the subsequent marriage, shall have been continually absent from such person for the space of seven years, and shall not have been heard of by such person as being alive within that time provided the person contracting such subsequent marriage shall before such marriage takes place, inform the person with whom such marriage is contracted of the real state of facts so far as the same are within his or her knowledge"".Gopal Lal vs State Of Rajasthan on 30 January, 1979 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1063154/ 3",['17']

The appellants in this appeal were defendants 1 and 2 in Speical Civil Suit NO.30 of 1979 which was filed by respondents 1 to 4 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Diuvion , at Dhule . For the sake of convenience, the parties will be refrerred to as the ""plaintiff"" and the ""defendat"". In orderto understand the nature of the suit it is necessary to mention the relationship between the parties. 2. One Tukaran had been married to Dagubai, whi is plaintiff 1 She has three daughter from Tukaram. They are plaintiff 2, 3 and 4. During the subsistience of his maraige with Dagubai, Tukaram marreid LIlabia, who is defendant 2, sometime in the yesr 1976. From her he got a son, shantaram, whi is defendant 1. Tukaram died in JUne, 1978. The plaintiff field the suit against the defendant who were in possession of several propertis which had been left by tukaram. The suit ws, in particular , for a declaraation that the defendant were not the legal heirs of Tukaram, that they had no right, title or ....Since the plaintiff who were four in number, were entitled to succeed to the estate of Tukaram, they also pryaed for partition and possession of the properties to the extent of 1|4 share toeach of them. In the alternative they prayed that in cse it was held that the first defendant had ashare in the properties then the Court should determine the shares and peartition the properties and give the same in the resepctive possession of the parties. The main thrust to of the plaintff, therefor in the suit was that the defendatn were not the legal heris of Tukaram during the subsistence of the latters valid mariaage with the first plaintiff. the defendants ressted the suit by contending that plaintiff 1, namely Dagubai, had been divorced by Tukaram as per the custom governing the community to which the parties belonged and it was thereafter that Tukaram maraie with defendant 2 took place. Hence the marriage between defendant 2 and Tukaram was valid and therefore the defendat were the heris of Tukaram. 3. The learnbed trial Judfge, after faming the necessary issues, held that though there was coustom which permitted divorce paet from the Hindu Marrigage Act in the community to which the parties belonged as a matter offact there was no divorce between Tukaram and dagubai. He therefore necessarily held that Tukaram maragie with defendant 2 was void under the provisions on S. 11 read with S. 5(I) , Hindu Marraige ACt. The result ws that defendant 2 was not be the validy married wife of Tukaram . In the absences of abetter compact word, we would be referring toher as the illegitimate wife. The first defendant who was the offspring of defendant 2 from her marrigae with Tukaram, was natually an ilegitimate son but for the provision contained in s. 16, Hindu Marraige Act. 4. The legal consequence , according to the learned trila Judge was that neither of the defendant had ashare in the properties of Tukaram. He however, held that both the defendant were entitled to o maintenace,. For this the learned trilal Judge relied upon Rajesbai Sadashic Khianar v.

While so holding, Masodkar, J in fact purposrted to apply a ruling of another judgement of this court,namely Govidrao v Anandibai (by Kania J as he then was), . As far the right of maintenance of childeren born of a viod maraige is concerned, s. 21(viii) read with s. 22 Hindu, Adoptions and Maintenavce Act, 1956, was sufficient authority. The leanred that teil Judge, theefore proceeded to declare that defendant were nothe legal heris of deceased Tukaram, and therfore they did not hae any right, title or inerest in for the properties left byhim except the claim for maintenace. He also directed the defendant deliver possession of all the properties to the plaintiff .The plaintff who were four in number were entitled to 1|4 share in the said properties.

The learned trial Judge also decreed that defendant 1 do recover Rs, 2,400 per year as maintencce till the becomes major from Jan 1983 and similarly defedant 2 do recover Rs. 2,400 per years as maintenace for her life from jan 1983 as long as she remained unmarried. Charge was kept on the properties for the maintenace of both the defedants. This was done by the learned trial Judge by his judgement and order deated 14th Deceber, 1982. 5. The defendants have challenged the said judgement and decree of the court below by contending that the Court below erred in holding that there was no divorce of Dagubnai by Tukaram. The defendant have also urged in this appeal that childern of a void marriage are letitimate for the purpose of succession to the property of the family in which they are born and ,mtherefore, defendant it is entitled to a share in Tukaram propertiess. 6. The plaintiff have field cross objections wherein has been urged that defendant 2, whose marraige with Tukaram has been held to be void, is not entitled to maintenace at all. According tothe plaintiff, there is no authority of law under which defendant 2 could legitimately claim maintenace, especially after death of the person to whom she had been married. 7. In respect of the finding recorded by the trila Court on the question of the divorce of Tukaram from Dahubai, it had been urged in the Court below that sometime in the year 1960 Tukaram had tranfered some of his proerties in favour of Dagubai for her maintenance. It is suggested that this Tukaram would not have dioneif he had not divorced her. There is enogu evidence to show that such transfer of properties whas in fact that such transfer of properties was in fact made in favour of Dagubai by Tukaram sometime in the year 1960. Mr. Tipnis, the learned Advocate appering for the defendant relied upon this circumstaces for persuading us to hold that there a divrce between Tukaram and Dagubai . It has alsoben urged by Mr,. Tipnis that the fact that Tukaram and Dagubai did not have any male issue, though they have some sort of compulsion on the part of Tukaram to take a second wife who would, according to the prevalaent sentiment in the commutnity would have give him a son. Apart from these two circumstances, which Mr. Tinpnis regard as strong circumstances, there ist he oral evidecne of one Babula, who was examined as defence witnes 5.Shantaram Tukaran Patil And Anr. vs Dagubai Tukaram Patil And Ors. on 9 January, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1449876/ 28. The fact that Tukaram tranferred some of his properties in favour of Dagubai in the year 1960 for maintenacne is , in our opinion, of little significance. At the most it may suggest that Tukaram and Dagubai were living separately. Even that seems to be doubtul because a dauther Sunada was born to them in the year 1961. Inmy case, such a circumstances as transfer of some properties by Tukaram in fovour of Dagubai, his wife does not, in our opinion , suggest that they were divocred. Somewhat stronger and nore perusasive evidence is necessary ot hold that couple who are maried validdly are validy divorced. Similarly, the fact tht the couple did not have any lae isue itself would not suggest that Tukaram had divorced his wife Dagubai. It may be Noted that the transfer of properties in favour of Dagubai took place sometime in the year 1960 . The last of the three daughter was born to Dagunai in the year 1961. The second mariage admittedly took plce in the year 1976. If Tukaram wanted to marry again to have a son after his apparent dissatisfaction with Dagubai who gave him three daughter, he would not have him three daughter, he would not have waited for nearly 15 years for the second marriage . It may be true that Tukaram like so many ingnorant person both in Indain and abrad, bneleived that the sex of a child is dterminded by the wife. It is a superstition which compes husnabd to seek another wife . It is a superstition which compels a husband to seek another wife and brings misery to the lives of innocent women who for no fault of their do not bear a male child,. It is more that adequately established that the determination of the sex of a child is wholly accidental neither the husband nor the wife making any contribution t it. At the time of the fertilization to of the female egg and the spermatozoa, the sex is determined depending upon the nature of the fertilization (see Encyclopaedia Britanncca,, Volume 27, 15th Edition page 250). Though Tukaram might have shard an eagerness to have a male child to on the facts of this case wer are satissfied that he facts of this case we are satisfied that he did not dicorce Dagubai in the year 1960 as contended by the defendants inoder to take a second wife for the purpose of having a male child. 9. The oral evidenvce of defendant witness 5, namely, Babulal, alsl does not inspire confidence in us, as it did not do in the mind of the learned trial Judge. His evidence is too vague, full of conjectures and surmises to be relied upon a matter of this type. He has in the first place deposed that thtere is a custiom is thiere community where by a documents is preppared in the presence of ppanchas under which a divorce is given. We need not dwell upon the question of this custom. Wheter in fact tukaram gave divorce to Dagubai is a question which is to be answered . In paras 3 and 4 and of his deposition, which is under thecross examination this witness has gven answer which unmistaably show that he has come only to oblige the defendat. He does not remeber the Tithi or on what day of the week Tukaramm gave or on divorce to dagubai, .He hs stated earlier in his deposition that such divorces are reduced to writing on a stamp paper in the case of Tukaram dicorce he does not remeber in whose name the stamp paper was purchased. That documant itself has not been made available to the Court . It is also difficult to accpet his evidence ion behalf of the defendant because it has been brought out in the cross examination that the first plaintiff has filed two criminal cases aganst him. There is no other evidence to coorroborate the testimony of Babulal. It s impossible to hold that Tukartam and Dahubai have dovorced in the year 1960 on the basis of the evidece gven by a witness in the year 1982 when the witness himself was about 20 years old when the divorce is alleged to have taken palce. We have no dificulty in confirming the finding of the learned trial Judge that there was no divorce between Tukaram and Dagubai. The result is that defendant was not validly married to Tukaram and , as stated earlier, is the illegitimate wife.

This is a second appeal against the Judgment and decree passed by the learned District Judge, Poona, in Civil Appeal No. 646 of 1967 on his file from the decree in Marriage Petition No. 18 of 1963 of the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Poona. It arises this way. 2 The appellant-petitioner was married to the respondent at Poona on 30th March 1962 according to Hindu religious rites. The petitioner alleged that during the negotiations as well as at the time of the solemnization of the marriage the respondent and her parents not only concealed the fact that she was suffering from epilepsy since childhood but also misrepresented to him and his father that she was quite healthy. Within a fortnight after the marriage which was consummated in the first week of April 1962, the respondent started getting epileptic fits. These fits recurred in the months of April, May and June at an interval of about a fortnight. The petitioner further alleged that in the first week of July 1962, he, for the first time, realised that the respondent was suffering from epilepsy which was an incurable disease and, therefore, he took her to the place of her elder sister Mrs. Deshpande in Poona and left her there on 6th July 1962. He also alleged that since after the discovery of this fraud on 2nd July 1962 till he took her to the house of her elder sister Mrs. Deshpande on 6th July 1962, he did not live with her as her husband. From 6th July 1962 the respondent never returned to his house. Alternatively, the petitioner alleged that within a short time after the marriage was consummated, the respondent started behaving in a queer way and also used to insult the petitioner and other members of his family. He, therefore, contended that having regard to the nature of the disease and the strange and unbecoming behaviour of the respondent, he reasonably apprehended that it would be harmful and injurious for him to live with her. He, therefore, prayed for a decree of nullity of the marriage on the ground of fraud, and in the alternative, a decree for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty. 3. The respondent contested the petitioner's claim vehemently. She denied the allegation of fraud and alleged that the fact that the respondent was suffering from epilepsy was brought to the notice of the petitioner's father and the petitioner during the negotiations. She denied that any fraud was practised on the petitioner and contended that he married her with free consent. She also alleged that soon after the marriage, the mother of her mother-in-law discovered a small white spot on her ways while giving her bath, whereupon the members of the family suspected that she was suffering from leucoderma, when in fact it was scar left of an insect-bite. The rest of the contentions in the written-statement are not material for our purpose. 4. On these pleadings, the learned trial Judge framed the necessary issues and on consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties, came to the conclusion that the petitioner had failed to prove that his consent was obtained by fraud or that the respondent was suffering from an incurable disease, and that, therefore, the petitioner was not entitled to a decree of nullity. As regards the alternative plea of the petitioner, the learned trial Judge found that the petitioner had failed to proveRaghunath Gopal Daftardar vs Sau, Vijaya Raghunath Daftardar on 15 March, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1702996/ 1the alleged cruelty and, therefore, dismissed his claim on that ground also. The petitioner then filed an appeal in the District Court, Poona. The learned District Judge found that the petitioner or his father was never told at any stage of the marriage either during the course of the negotiations or at the time of the solemnization that the respondent was suffering from epilepsy, that generally there might have been statements made by the parents and the relations of the respondent that she was healthy, that the respondent herself never told either the petitioner or any of his relations that she was healthy, that the type of epilepsy from which the respondent was suffering was not an incurable disease, that the alleged fraud was discovered by the petitioner on 26th June 1962 or at the most on 2nd July 1962, that thereafter till the respondent was taken by the petitioner to the house of the former's sister on 6th July 1962, both of them were living together as husband and wife with free consent of the petitioner, and that the non-disclosure of the disease of epilepsy either during the course of the negotiations or at the time of the solemnization and the alleged misrepresentation that the respondent was healthy did not amount to fraud in law, and that the petitioner had also failed to prove the alleged cruelty. The learned District Judge, therefore, confirmed the decree of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal with costs. Being aggrieved by this judgment and decree, the petitioner has come to his Court in second appeal. 5. On the arguments advanced before me, the first point that arises for consideration is whether the petitioner has been able to prove in this case that the type of epilepsy, from which the respondent is suffering is an incurable epilepsy. The learned District Judge has recorded a finding against the petitioner on this point. The finding is based on appreciation of evidence and, therefore, ordinarily the appellant-petitioner is not entitled to ask this Court to go into the evidence again and come to its own finding. However, the learned counsel Mr. Parajnape, appearing on behalf of the appellant-petitioner, has argued that though the finding is a finding of fact, the learned Judge having misread the whole evidence, this Court may not accept it and at any rate, for finding out whether or not the learned Judge has misread the evidence, it would be necessary to consider the evidence again in this Court. The learned Counsel Mr. Paranjape, therefore, took me through the evidence on this point and I must say that on going through the evidence, I find that there is no reason why I should differ from the view taken by the learned District Judge. 6.The most important piece of evidence on this point is that of Dr. Sardesai, P. W. 5. The witness is an M. D. of the Bombay University and has also passed M. R. C. P. examination of the Edinborough Royal College of Physicians. Since February 1959 he is attached to the Sassoon Hospital as an Honorary consulting physician. He is both a physician and neurologist practising as a consulting Physician at Poona since August 1960. He is also practising in Neurology since then. Admittedly, the respondent is being treated by this Doctor since about February 1961 for epilepsy. Now, he says that it would not be correct to say that the type of epilepsy the respondent is suffering from, is incurable. He has prescribed 'Dilantin Sodium' to the respondent for this disease and the Doctor says that he has prescribed it with a view to keep her malady under control. When he was asked whether it could be said that the respondent was cured of the disease, he replied that it would not be possible for him to say whether he epilepsy had been cured, because this could only be said if the drug is withdrawn. Later on, he has stated thus :-Raghunath Gopal Daftardar vs Sau, Vijaya Raghunath Daftardar on 15 March, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1702996/ 2""It would be wrong to say that epilepsy is a disease which cannot be cured. The latest publication on 'Therapeutics' by Goodamn and Gillam is the standard book on the Science of Treatment. An older view which believed in the past was that epilepsy was incurable. It would not be correct to say and it is also not to my knowledge that at the present day, there are some authorities in medical science of treatment, who believe that epilepsy is incurable."" It is, therefore, quite clear from his evidence that the disease epilepsy is not an incurable disease. As regards the type of epilepsy from which the respondent is suffering, he has said that if the respondent ceased to get any epileptic fits for a period of three years, he would say that she is cured. He has also said that he was treating the respondent since February 1961 and he could find that for a period of about one year before her marriage, she did not get any epileptic fits. He further says that the drug which he prescribed has worked well. According to him, the respondent is receiving the treatment even today and the disease is well under control. Reliance is then placed on the testimony of Dr. Otturkar, P. W. 3. According to the petitioner the prescription, Ex. 179, dated 2nd June 1962, given by Dr. Sardesai to the respondent, was shown to Dr. Otturkar by his father. Dr. Otturkar being his close friend. Dr. Otturkar asked the petitioner's father whether the respondent was getting any fits and when the latter told him that she was, looking to the prescription, he told the petitioner's father that she was being treated for epilepsy. However, Dr. Otturkar further said that he would get it confirmed from Dr. Sardesai. Now, Dr. Otturkar has given his version of the talk Dr. Sardesai had with him, in his evidence. This version is little different on the point, from the one given by Dr. Sardesai and to which I have already made a reference. Now, according to Dr. Otturkar, what Dr. Sardesai told him was that epilepsy was such a kind of disease which could not be cured but could only be controlled. Dr. Sardesai also told him that the disease could only be kept under control by regular treatment and if the treatment is discontinued, the patient would again start getting epileptic fits. But later on, he admits that Dr. Sardesai also said that the patients suffering from epilepsy were required to take medicines for a very long time and continue the same treatment for about three years after they cease getting any epileptic fits. Now, I have already pointed out that Dr. Sardesai, who was examined by the petitioner himself, nowhere says that epilepsy does not admit of any cure. On the contrary, he says that it is not an incurable disease. But Dr. Otturkar, perhaps to oblige the father of the petitioner, who is his friend, told the Court something different from what the opinion of Dr. Sardesai was. It is material to note that no question was put to Dr. Sardesai regarding the version given by Dr. Otturkar. Coming to the evidence of the petitioner, he says that he came to know from Dr. Otturkar that the disease was incurable and hereditary. There is nothing in the evidence of Dr. Otturkar to show that the disease is hereditary. He only says that what he came to know from Dr. Sardesai was that it was incurable. But I have already pointed out that that was never the opinion of Dr. Sardesai much less he gave that opinion to Dr. Otturkar. The petitioner's father, who is also examined in this case (P. W. 1), repeats the same story. When the petitioner took the respondent to the house of the latter's sister on 6th July 1962, his father was not at home. He was on tour in Nagpur. He, therefore, contacted the petitioner on telephone and what he came to know from the petitioner was that the opinion of Dr. Sardesai was that the disease was incurable and hereditary. Thus the evidence adduced by the petitioner not only does not show that the disease is incurable, but on the contrary it shows that the disease of epilepsy can be cured.Raghunath Gopal Daftardar vs Sau, Vijaya Raghunath Daftardar on 15 March, 1971 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1702996/ 3",['15']

This appeal is by the original petitioner-husband against the judgment and decree dated 15th March, 1993 passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bombay, in M. J. Petition No. A-877 of 1991. The husband had filed the petition for divorce mainly on two grounds, viz. :-- (i) that he was treated by the respondent-wife with cruelty after the solemnisation of the marriage, as contemplated by Cl.(ia) of sub-sec. (1) of S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; and (ii) that the respondent-wife had deserted him for a continuous period of not less than two years immedialely preceding the presentation of the petition, as contemplated by Cl. (ib) of sub-sec. (1) of S. 13 of the said Act. Another ground on which relief was sought was under Cl. (a) of sub-sect ion (1) of S. 13 of the Act contending that the marriage was not consummated. However, this contention has not been pressed before us. Under the impugned-judgment, the husband's petition has been dismissed with costs. The wife's counter-claim in respect of certain ornaments, which she claimed as her streedhan property, has been decreed fully to the tune of Rs. 1,15,415 and the husband has been ordered to pay Rs. 1200/- per month to the wife by way of maintenance. It is this decree which has been challenged before us by the husband in the present Appeal. At the stage of admission of this Appeal, this Court directed the husband to deposit a sum of Rs. 40,000/-from out of the amount of Rs. 1,15,415/-decreed in favour of the wife. This was the condition on which stay of the decree was granted. The amount of maintenance was raised to Rs. 1500/- per month pending the Appeal. 2. We have heard Shri Gupte, the learned counsel for the husband, and the respondent-wife in person at great length during the last two weeks. When this matter was initially called out, we enquired with the spouses as to whether it was possible to reconcile their differences and start living together. After a brief adjournment, the parties expressed their inability to reconcile their differences. We had even asked Shri Gupte to act as a mediator and try to bring about a reconciliation between the spouses. However, after a day, he regretted his inability to bring about any reconciliation. When the matter was part-heard over the last week-end, we had again requested both the spouses to meet and try to reconcile their differences, but on resumption of the hearing this week, the parties again expressed their inability to reconcile their differences. Under the circumstances, we are left with no alternative, but to proceed with the matter and decide the same in accordance with law. 3. A few admitted facts may be stated as under:--Rajan Vasant Revankar vs Mrs. Shobha Rajan Revankar on 24 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1005706/ 1The husband Rajan is a Chartered Accountant. The wife Shobha was a B.Sc. with Mathematics when she married the appellant, but in June, 1988 she has passed her First LL.B. and in June, 1990 she has passed her Second LL.B. and she is now doing her Final Year LL.B. Course. The spouses were distantly related and their families had known each other before the marriage. They were engaged at the house of the wife at Bandra --Bombay -- on the I9th December, 1985. The marriage took place at Dombivili, near Bombay, on the 4th June, 1986. There is some unpleasantness suggested on account of the husband's failure to mention his academic qualifications in the Marriage Invitation Card which was being finalised in the month of May, 1986. This event led the wife and particularly, her father to doubt the appellant being a Chartered Accountant and his holding the requisite qualification. This is clear from the letter dated 15th May, 1986 at Exh. 58 written by the wife to the husband. In the said letter, the wife specifically confessed that she had felt sorry for having questioned his educational qualification and argued with him on that point which had hurt him very much. However, that issue was resolved between the parties and we are not attaching any importance to this controversy, because what is required by S. 13(1)(ia) is that after solemnisation of the marriage, one spouse has. treated the other spouse with cruelty. 4. After the marriage at Bombay on the 4th June, 1986, the spouses immediately left for Pune where the husband lives and where the husband's family had arranged a reception on the 7th June, 1986. After attending the reception at Pune, both the spouses returned to Bombay on the 8th June, 1986 and stayed at the wife's father's place till the 14th June, 1986 i.e. to say for 6 days. On the 14th June, 1986, the spouses returned to Pune and stayed at the husband's house till 30th June, 1986, that is to say for about 10 days. On June 30, 1986 the spouses came to Bombay. The husband dropped the wife at her father's place and returned to Pune and the wife continued to stay with her father till the 13th July, 1986 when she returned to Pune. The spouses stayed at Pune from 13th July till 12th August, 1986. Certain letters have been exchanged during this period and certain events have occurred, to which we will make a reference at a later stage of this judgment. On the 12th August, 1986 the wife returned to Bombay and stayed with her father till 8th September, 1986, that is to say for a period of about 28 days. Some more letters have been exchanged during this period, of which we will say a little later. On the 8th September, 1986, the wife returned to Pune and stayed with the husband till 9th October, 1986, that is to say for about a month. On the 9th October, 1986, both of them came to Bombay. The husband dropped the wife at her father's place and returned to Pune. Admittedly, there has been no cohabitation after the 9th October, 1986. 5. Initially, the husband filed the petition for divorce in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Pune, on July 30, 1987. However, on a petition being made to this Court, the Pune petition was transferred to the Family Court, Bombay, and was heard at Bombay. The written statement, Exh. 11, was filed on 24th March, 1988. While generally denying the allegations of ""cruelty"" made against her, in Para 6, the wife admitted that the husband was the only son of his parents, both of whom were recently operated and hospitalised. The mother was suffering from blood pressure and the father was operated thrice for peptic ulcer. She admitted that in preparing food for both of them, special care had to be taken. In Para 9 she admits that the fall from the motor-cycle at Pune on the 23rd July, 1986 was purely an accident. In Para 18 of the written statement while purporting to put up her own case, she contended that there was a demand for additional dowry and hence, she was being harassed. Though the allegation is bald, the pointer is towards the mother of the husband. TheRajan Vasant Revankar vs Mrs. Shobha Rajan Revankar on 24 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1005706/ 2written statement was amended pursuant to the order passed on the 2nd July, 1992 and by a counter-claim lodged on the 6th July, 1992 the wife claimed her ornaments and articles worth Rupees 1,15,415. 6. At the outset, Shri Gupte, the learned counsel for the husband, has frankly stated that he was not pressing the husband's case for a decree on the ground of desertion, as contemplated by Cl. (ib) of S. 13(1). He was also not pressing his case on the ground of absence of consummation of marriage and hence, it is not necessary for us to refer to these aspects of the matter. Both sides confined their arguments to the question of the alleged cruelty after the solemnisation of the marriage. We will have, therefore, to examine the contentions of both sides only on the question as to whether the husband has made out a case that after the solemnisation of the marriage, the respondent-wife has treated him with cruelty. 7. It is now well-settled that though the word 'cruelty' has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act, 'cruelty' contemplated under Cl. (ia) of S. 13(1) neither attracts the old English doctrine of danger, nor the statutory limits embodied in the old Section 10(1)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. After the amendment of 1976, 'cruelty' contemplated by S. 13(1)(ia) is a conduct of such type that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent or that it has become impossible for the spouses to live together. This is now clear in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of N. Bhagat v. Mrs. D. Bhagat, reported in Judgment Today . On a review of the earlier Supreme Court decisions, right from the case of Dr. N. G. Dastane v. Mrs. S. Dastane, . the Supreme Court has laid down the legal position which now obtains after the amendment of 1976 to the Hindu Marriage Act. In Para 17 of the judgment in Bhagat's case , the Supreme Court has observed, thus, at page 437 (of JT (SC)) : (at p. 717 of AIR):-- ""17. Mental cruelty in S. 13(1)(ia) can broadly be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such mental pain and suffering as would make it not possible for that party to live with the other. In other words, mental cruelty must he of such as nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together. The situation must be such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with the other party. It is not necessary to prove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to the health of the petitioner. While arriving at such conclusion, regard must be had to the social status, educational level of the parties, the society they move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living together in case they are already living apart and all other relevant facts and circumstances which it is neither possible nor desirable to set out exhaustively. What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case. It is a matter to be determined in each case having regard to the facts and circumstances of that case. If it is a case of accusations and allegations, regard must also be had to the context in which they were made"". Shri Gupte also invited our attention to the earlier Full Bench decision of this Court in the case of Dr. Keshaorao Krishnaji Londhe v. Mrs Nisha Londhe , where a Similar view was taken. However, in view of the ratio of the Supreme Court decision reproduced above, it is not necessary for us to refer to any more decisions on the point.Rajan Vasant Revankar vs Mrs. Shobha Rajan Revankar on 24 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1005706/ 3",['10']

Prabha, Advocate representing the PCSJ were in fact present in Court and have made their submissions strongly supporting the case of the petitioner.

No. 4319 of 1991 is also a Christian governed by the Act. At the time of filing the O.P. the petitioner was aged 39 and was working as a High School Assistant at the Government High School, Pattambi. She was married to the third respondent on 14.2.1980 at St. Peter St. Paul Church, Amaravathy, Kochi, according to the rites, ceremonies and customs of theMary Sonia Zachariah vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 24 February, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/637104/ 1said Church. According to the petitioner they lived together as husband and wife till 18.7.1981 and thereafter the third respondent has deserted her with the intention of abandoning her permanently against her wish. It is her further case that during the period they lived together as husband and wife, the third respondent's conduct towards the petitioner was very cruel and he had subjected the petitioner to insults, abuses and accusations of adulterous conduct even in the presence of public, her colleagues, students and relatives. She has alleged that the desertion, insults, abuses and accusations of adulterous conduct and threats of physical violence had made the continuance of the married life impossible. Before filing of this O.P., petitioner has filed O.P. No. 153 of 1985 before the District Court, Thrissur under Section 22 of the Act for a decree of Judicial separation On the ground of cruelty and desertion of the third respondent. As per Ext. P1 judgment in O.P. No. 153 of 1985 dated 28.7.1988, the Addl. District Judge has specifically found that the third respondent is guilty of cruelty and desertion and has granted a decree for judicial separation as prayed for. Petitioner has alleged that in spite of the lapse of more than two years there has not been resumption of cohabitation and there is not even an 'iota of chance for reconciliation. Petitioner has further alleged that even though there is no chance of reconciliation, it may not be possible for her to get a divorce since desertion and cruelty are not recognised as grounds for divorce unless adultery is also alleged and proved by her. It is in the circumstances that the petitioner has also challenged the constitutional validity of Section 10 of the Act. 5. The other material allegations, contentions and reliefs prayed for in the O.Ps. are more or less same or similar and briefly thus: Indian women of all religions other than Christianity are entitled to get divorce on grounds of cruelty and/or desertion which are recognised as independent grounds for divorce under the respective enactments applicable to them. For Christians who are governed by the Act, cruelty and desertion are not by themselves independent grounds for divorce. To be grounds for divorce, adultery should also be alleged and proved along with cruelty or desertion as far as Christians governed by the Act are concerned. As adultery is often committed with calculated care and utmost secrecy, direct proof of adultery is very difficult. Under the Indian social set up it is well nigh impossible for a woman to prove adultery of her husband. This renders the provisions for divorce virtually infructuous for a woman. The requirement of proving adultery along with cruelty and desertion to make out a ground for divorce under Section 10 of the Act violates the petitioners' fundamental right to equality and right to live with dignity and personal liberty enshrined in Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Denial of divorce on the ground of cruelty or desertion without reasonable excuse for a period of two years or upwards which are grounds for divorce for all Indians of all other religions except Christians is discrimination based solely on the ground of religion. While Section 10 confers on the husband a right to get divorce on proof of adultery simplicitor the wife is obliged to prove either cruelty or desertion along with adultery to get a divorce. This again is a discrimination based solely on sex which makes the provision constitutionally bad. In support of the contentions raised in the O.Ps., the petitioners have referred to the relevant provisions in all other enactments dealing with divorce in force in India and some of the Acts in force in England and the various recommendations made by the Law Commission of India from time to time as part of the pleadings in the O.Ps. 6. The petitioners have thus contended that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it makes adultery also necessary to be established along with cruelty and desertion as a ground for divorce is arbitrary,Mary Sonia Zachariah vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 24 February, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/637104/ 2authoritarian and violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 7. The petitioner in O.P. No. 5805 of 1988 has further contended that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it incorporates the word 'incestuous' before the word 'adultery' thereby making an aggravated form of adultery alone as a ground for divorce for Christian women whereas all other Indians including Christain men are entitled to get divorce on the ground of adultery simplicitor is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. 8. The substantive reliefs prayed for in the two O.Ps. can be summarised thus : (1) to declare that Section 10 of the Act in so far as it incorporates the word 'incestuous' before the word 'adultery' the words ""adultery coupled with' occurring before 'such cruelty as without adultery would have entitled her to a divorce a mensa et toro' and 'desertion without reasonable excuse for two years or upwards' is violative of Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India; and (2) to declare that 'adultery', 'such cruelty as without adultery would have entitled to a divorce mensa et toro' and 'desertion without reasonable excuse for two years or upwards' are grounds for dissolution of marriage for a wife under the Act. 9. Union of India has filed a counter affidavit opposing the reliefs prayed for in the O.Ps. and raising mainly the following contentions: Though the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, following which the Act was framed has undergone various drastic changes, the Act has remained in force unchanged till date. In spite of repeated recommendations made by the Law Commission of India for amending the law regarding marriage and divorce among Christians, Government was not able to undertake any legislations to amend the law in view of the strong opposition from the community itself. So far the constitutionality of the provisions contained in Section 10 of the Act has been upheld by various Courts including the Supreme Court whenever such challenge had been made in the past. Different personal laws are applicable to different communities in India. The debates of the constituent Assembly relating to Article 35 of the draft Constitution corresponding to Article 44 of the Constitution leave no scope for doubt with regard to the fact that the Constitution makers envisaged the continuance of personal laws applicable to different communities for quite sometime, if not indefinitely. Only by legislation amendment can be brought to the provisions in the Act. So long as such pre-constitutional personal laws are not changed by the legislature, such laws are protected by Article 13 of the Constitution of India. While changing a personal law like the Act, Government have necessarily to take into account the readiness of the community to accept reforms. So far the community has not expressed its readiness to accept the reforms proposed to the personal law governing marriage and divorce among Christians. As regards the scope of judicial intervention by Court, it has been consistently held by all the Courts that Section 10 of the Act specifically sets forth the grounds on which the marriage can be dissolved and no additional grounds can be included by judicial construction of similar provisions in other enactments unless the Section plainly comprehends such grounds. No parallel can be drawn between the personal laws relating to one community and another community for making a ground of discrimination. Grounds for divorce are bound to differ from one law to the other depending upon the community to which it concerns. The challenge raised against the provisions based upon the alleged violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be sustained in view of the factMary Sonia Zachariah vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 24 February, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/637104/ 3","['22', '10']"

It  will invariably  be expedient to have a joint or consolidated hearing or trial by one and the same Court of a husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights on the ground that  the wife has withdrawn from his society without reasonable excuse  under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act and the  wife's petition for judicial separation against her husband on  ground of  cruelty under  section 10 of the said Act in  order to  avoid conflicting decisions being rendered by two  different Courts.  In such  a situation  resort will have to be had to the 224 powers under  sections 23  to 25 of the Civil Procedure Code for directing  transfer of  the petitions for a consolidated hearing. [228 G-H, 227A]      2:1.  On   a  proper   construction  of   the  relevant provisions, it cannot be said that the substantive provision contained in  section 25 Civil Procedure Code is excluded by reason of  section 21  of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955. [226 F]      2:2. In  terms, section  21 C.P.C.  does not  make  any distinction between procedural and substantive provisions of C.P.C. and  all that it provides is that the Code, as far as may be, shall apply to all proceedings under the Act and the phrase ""as  far as  may be"" means and is intended to exclude only  such   provisions  of  the  Code  as  are  or  may  be inconsistent with  any of  the provisions of the Code. It is impossible to  say that  such  provisions  of  the  Code  as partake of  the character of substantive law are excluded by implication as  no such implication can be read into section 21 of  the Act  and  a  particular  provision  of  the  Code irrespective of whether it is procedural or substantive will not apply  only if it is inconsistent with any provisions of the Act.

By the amendment very wide and plenary power has been conferred  on the  Supreme Court  for the first time to transfer any suit, appeal or other proceedings from one High Court to  another High  Court or from one Civil Court in one State to  another Civil  Court in any other State throughout the country.

Per Amrendra Nath Sen, J.      1.  A  plain  reading  of  section  25  C.P.C.  clearly indicates that  very wide  jurisdiction and powers have been conferred on  the Supreme Court to transfer any suit, appeal or any  other proceedings  from a  High Court or other Civil Court in  any State  to a High Court or other Civil Court in any other  State for  the ends  of  justice.

[232 E-G]      2 :  3. Section  21A of  the Hindu  Marriage  Act  has, indeed, no bearing on the question of jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under section 25 C.P.C. Section 21A has no application  to the  case of  transfer  of  any  suit  or proceeding from one State to another. [233 B-C]      2 :  4.

The short point for decision in this appeal is whether a decree can be passed on a petition for mutual divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, when one of the petitioners withdraws consent to such decree prior to the passing of such decree. 3. In the instant case, the appellant husband was married to the respondent wife on 22nd June, 1985, according to Hindu rites. On account of differences between them, they took a decision to obtain a decree of mutual divorce, which resulted in the filing of a joint petition for divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') on 4th September, 2004, in the District Court at Chhindwara. The same was registered as Civil Suit No.167-A of 2004. As required under the provisions of Section 13-B of the aforesaid Act, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, fixed the date for consideration of the petition after six months so as to give the parties time to reconsider their decision. On 7th March, 2005, after the expiry of six months, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, took up the matter in the presence of both the parties who were present in the Court. While the appellant husband reiterated his earlier stand that a decree of mutual divorce should be passed on account of the fact that it was not possible for the parties to live together, on behalf of the respondent wife it was submitted that despite serious differences which had arisen between them, she did not want the marriage ties to be dissolved. On account of withdrawal of consent by the respondent wife, theAnil Kumar Jain vs Maya Jain on 1 September, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/447829/ 1learned Judge dismissed the joint petition under Section 13-B of the Act. 4. Aggrieved by the order dated 17th March, 2005, passed by the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, the appellant filed an appeal under Section 28 of the Act in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur on 4th April, 2005, and the same was registered as First Appeal no.323 of 2005. Even before the High Court, on 12th March, 2007, the respondent wife expressed her desire to live separately from the appellant, but she did not want that a decree of dissolution of marriage be passed. In that view of the matter, by his order dated 21st March, 2007, the learned Single Judge dismissed the First Appeal. While dismissing the appeal, the learned Single Judge took note of the decision of this Court in similar circumstances in the case of Ashok Hurra v. Rupa Bipin Zaveri [1997 (4) SCC 226], wherein this Court granted a decree of mutual divorce by exercising its extra-ordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. It was indicated that the High Court did not have such powers and Section 13-B required that the consent of the spouses on the basis of which the petition under Section 13-B was presented, had to continue till a decree of divorce was passed by mutual consent. On that basis, the learned Single Judge of the High Court, while dismissing the appeal, observed that the appellant would be free to file a petition of divorce in accordance with law, which would be decided on its own merits by keeping in mind the special fact that the parties were living separately for about five years and the respondent wife was adamant about living apart from her husband. 5. It is against the said order passed by the High Court rejecting the appellant's prayer for grant of mutual divorce that the present appeal has been filed. 6. Appearing on behalf of the appellant husband, Mr. Rohit Arya, learned Senior Advocate, contended that prior to the filing of the petition for mutual divorce, the parties had entered into a settlement which had been fully acted upon by the appellant and that under the said agreement valuable property rights had been transferred to the respondent wife, which she was and is still enjoying. Mr. Arya submitted that apart from the above, the attitude of the respondent wife in openly declaring that she had no intention to remain with the appellant, was sufficient to indicate that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and in similar circumstances this Court had invoked its extra-ordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant a decree of divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, even though one of the parties had withdrawn consent before the passing of the final decree. Reference was made to the decision in Ashok Hurra's case(supra), which also involved a petition under Section 13-B of the Act. 7. However, the facts of the said case were a little different from those in the instant case. In the said case, after six months from the date of filing of the petition under Section 13-B, an application was filed by the husband alone for a decree of divorce on the petition under Section 13-B of the Act. Not only did the wife not join in the said application, she made a separate application for withdrawal of consent given by her for mutual divorce after the expiry of 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition. At this juncture, reference may be made to the provisions of Section 13-B of the above Act and the same is extracted hereinbelow :- ""13B. Divorce by mutual consent. -Anil Kumar Jain vs Maya Jain on 1 September, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/447829/ 2(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the district Court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage was solemnized before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. (2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of the presentation of the petition referred to in sub- section (1) and not later than eighteen months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the court shall, on being satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, that a marriage has been solemnized and that the averments in the petition are true, pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of the decree."" As will be clear from the above, sub-Section (1) of Section 13-B is the enabling Section for presenting a petition for dissolution of a marriage by a decree of divorce by mutual consent. One of the grounds provided is that the parties have been living separately for a period of one year or more and that they have not been able to live together, which is also the factual reality in the instant case. Sub-Section (2) of Section 13-B, however, provides the procedural steps that are required to be taken once the petition for mutual divorce has been filed and six months have expired from the date of presentation of the petition before the Court. The language is very specific in that it intends that on a motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of presentation of the petition referred to in sub-Section (1) and not later than 18 months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the Court shall, on being satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of the decree. 8. The question whether the consent of both the parties given at the time of presentation of the petition for mutual divorce under Section 13-B of the Act must continue till the decree is finally passed, has been the subject matter of several decisions of this Court. The issue was raised in the case of Smt. Sureshta Devi vs. Om Prakash [(1991) 2 SCC 25], wherein this Court held that the consent given by the parties to the filing of a petition for mutual divorce had to subsist till a decree was passed on the petition and that in the event, either of the parties withdrew the consent before passing of the final decree, the petition under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act would not survive and would have to be dismissed. 9. Subsequently, however, in Ashok Hurra's case (supra), doubts were expressed by this Court with regard to certain observations made in Sureshta Devi's case (supra) and it was felt that the same might require re-consideration in an appropriate case. Basing its decision on the doctrine of irretrievable break-down of marriage, the Hon'ble Judges were of the view that no useful purpose would be served in prolonging the agony of the parties to a marriage which had broken downAnil Kumar Jain vs Maya Jain on 1 September, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/447829/ 3","['28','13-B']"

The facts have been set out in detail by my brother Mukhi in his judgment and it is not necessary for me to set them out again. Suffice it to say that, on a petition filed by the respondent-husband for judicial separation on the ground, inter alia, of desertion under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, being Marriage Petition No. 5 of 1966, after evidence was taken, the parties presented a joint compromise purshis on September 5, 1966 in which it was stated that, in view of the evidence led before the Court, it appeared that the parties could not live together as husband and wife and there was, therefore, no objection from them to a decree for judicial separation being passed by the Court. It was, therefore, prayed in the purshis that a decree might be passed accordingly, and it was further stated that the parties were agreed that a sum of Rs. 60 per month should be paid by the husband by way of maintenance to the wife. On that purshis, the learned Judge recorded the fact that the parties admitted the settlement as per the said purshis which had been read out and fully explained to them, and then proceeded to state as follows: Decree in terms of this purshis and as per settlement recorded in the same and under judgment to follow. Later on, on the same day, the learned Judge proceeded to deliver a judgment in which, after referring to the pleadings in the usual way, he set out the issues, in which the second issue related to question of desertion for the statutory period. The learned Judge then set out the substance of the evidence given by the husband as well as the wife and then stated as1 follows: Even from the case which she has made out in her W.S. and also at the trial, it appears, that she would also be entitled for a decree for judicial separation on her own contentions and the petitioner has sought for the same relief. A good deal of effort was made, to see if there could be a reconciliation but all the efforts failed, and therefore, even on the evidence of the parties, it appears to me, that a decree for judicial separation between the parties would only be a proper solution, in the interest of the parties. I have therefore, answered issues Nos. 2 and 3 accordingly. In the next paragraph of his judgment the learned Judge proceeded to refer to the joint compromise purshis filed by the parties and stated as follows: Relying upon this joint purshis also, I have recorded my findings on issues Nos. 2 and 3.... He then passed a decree for desertion in favour of the husband and directed payment of alimony by him to his wife, at the agreed rate.Sou.

After the expiry of the statutory period of two years provided in Section 13(1A)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the husband thereafter presented, on September 11, 1968, a petition for divorce, being petition No. 118 of 1968, on the ground that there was no resumption of cohabitation between the parties for the statutory period after the passing of the decree for judicial separation on September 5, 1966. In her written statement, the wife contended that no decree for divorce could be passed because the decree for judicial separation had been passed on the basis of consent terms and was, therefore, illegal and not binding on her. The learned trial Judge held that the decree in Marriage Petition No. 5 of 1966 was not a compromise decree, and he, therefore granted the decree for divorce prayed for by the husband. On an appeal by the wife to the District Court at Poona, being Civil Appeal No. 982 of 1969, it was held that the decree for judicial separation in Marriage Petition No. 5 of 1966 was not unlawful and that the proper remedy for the respondent was to appeal from it, which she had not done, and the said appeal No. 982 of 1969 was, therefore, dismissed. The wife thereafter filed a Second Appeal to this Court, and it came up before my brother Bhasme who referred it to a Division Bench. That is how this appeal came up before my brothers Bhole and Mukhi who, after hearing the same, delivered differing judgments. 3. My brother Mukhi has delivered a very learned and well-considered judgment in which he has dealt exhaustively with the various questions that were argued and raised at the hearing before them. My brother Bhole has also delivered a well-considered judgment in which, however, he has confined himself to a narrower compass. In my opinion, the matter is concluded by a very recent decision of the Supreme Court, and the only question that arises in this appeal is one of applying the principles laid down in that decision to the present case. In that view of the matter, it is really unnecessary for me to consider any of the other decisions which were cited before the learned differing Judges or before me. Before I deal with that judgment of the Supreme Court, it is, however, necessary for me to set out the relevant statutory provisions contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 4. Section 10 of the said Act lays down the grounds on which a petition for judicial separation can be presented, and the very first ground is, desertion for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. Section 13 lays down the grounds on which a petition for divorce may be presented, and Sub-section (1A) thereof enacts that a petition for divorce may be presented on the ground that there had been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties to the marriage for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they were parties. Section 21 of the said Act provides that, subject to the other provisions contained in the said Act, all proceedings thereunder are to be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure. Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the Act is in the following terms: 23. (1) In any proceeding under this Act, whether defended or not, if the court is satisfied that- (a) any of the grounds for granting relief exists and the petitioner is not in any way taking advantage of his or her own wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief, andSou. Ramkuvar Madanlal Atale vs Madanlal Surajkaran Atale on 21 August, 1974 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1904898/ 2(b) where the ground of the petition is the ground specified in clause (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10, or in Clause (i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13, the petitioner has not in any manner been accessory to or connived at or condoned the act or acts complained of, or where the ground of the petition is cruelty the petitioner has not in any manner condoned the cruelty, and (c) the petition is not presented or prosecuted in collusion with the respondent, and (d) there has not been any unnecessary or improper delay in instituting the proceeding, and (e) there is no other legal ground why relief should not be granted, then, and in such a case, but not otherwise, the court shall decree such relief accordingly. Considering these statutory provisions, apart from the authority, it appears to me to be clear that only these provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure would be applicable which are not, in any manner, contrary to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act itself. In that view of the matter, in my opinion, even on a plain reading of Sections 21 and 23(1) it is clear that Order XXIII, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure which enjoins that the Court must pass decree in accordance with a compromise arrived at between the parties is not applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, by reason of the provisions of Section 23(1)(a) of the said Act which lay down in mandatory terms that before a Court can grant a decree under the said Act, it must be satisfied that one or other of the statutory grounds for granting relief exists in the case before it. It is only on the Court being so satisfied that it gets the jurisdiction to grant a decree under the said Act, and it cannot pass a decree ""otherwise"" as the concluding portion of Section 23(1) clearly states. The word ""otherwise"" which occurs there must naturally and necessarily comprise a decree by consent and the Court cannot, therefore, pass a consent decree unless it is itself satisfied that one or other of the grounds for granting the relief sought by the petitioner exists. I will now turn to the very recent decision of the Supreme Court to which I have referred above, and that is the decision in the case of Nagindas v. Dalpatram [1974] A.I.R. 471. The facts of that case were that the appellant before the Supreme Court was a tenant of certain premises at Surat where, at the material time, Bombay Rents, etc. Act of 1947 was applicable. The landlords (respondents before the Supreme Court) served a notice on the tenant terminating his tenancy and also requiring him to pay arrears of rent, and thereafter filed a suit for possession against the tenant on the ground of non-payment of rent, as well as on the ground of bona fide requirement of the premises by the landlords for their own use. The parties thereafter arrived at a compromise under which the tenant was to hand over possession of the suit premises without objection to the landlords by the September 30, 1968, and was to pay a certain amount as and by way of mesne profits. After the expiry of that date, the landlords filed a petition to recover possession of the suit premises in execution of the decree. One of the objections raised by the tenant to the said petition was that, since the decree had been passed by the Court without satisfying itself as to the existence of a ground of eviction under the Bombay Rents Act, it was a nullity and was not executable. The executing Court upheld that contention of the tenant and held the decree to be void, but that order of the executing Court was set aside by the Extra Assistant Judge at Surat, on appeal, holding that there was ample material in the shape of admissions in the compromise itself from which the Court could be satisfiedSou.

Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav vs Anantrao Shivram Adhav And ... on 22 April, 1982 Equivalent citations: (1982) 84 BOMLR 298 Author: Rege Bench: B Gadgil, D Rege, M Chandurkar JUDGMENT Rege, J. 1. This Criminal Revision Application has come up before this Full Bench on a Reference by the Division Bench (Dharmadhikari and Puranik, JJ.) since on the question involved in this application, it disagreed with the view taken by this Court in its decision by earlier Division Bench (Shah and Kanade, JJ.) in the case of Bajirao v. Tolanbai (1979 Mah LJ 693) : (1980 Cri LJ 473) and thought the same required reconsideration. 2. The question involved, shortly, was :- Whether a Hindu woman, whose marriage was null and void under section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, by reason of contravention of Section 5(i) of the said Act, viz. the person with whom she had undergone a marriage had a wife living at the time of the said marriage, was entitled to claim maintenance under section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure from such a person on the basis that she was his wife. 3. Few basic facts, not in dispute are :- The marriage of the petitioner - Yamunabai - with the respondent No. 1 was performed on 16-6-1974 after undergoing necessary rites under the Hindu law, which was the personal law of the parties. The said marriage was also registered as required under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, at the time when the said marriage was performed, respondent's first wife Lilabai was alive and the said marriage between them was subsisting. The petitioner stayed with the respondent No. 1 for a week and thereafter stayed at 1st respondent's house at his village with his first wife Lilabai and her mother. She alleged ill-treatment and left the respondent's house. She then made an application to the Magistrate under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred to as 'the Code') for maintenance being application No. 157 of 1976. The Magistrate dismissed the said application on the ground that she was not a wife of the respondent as her marriage with the respondent was null and void under section 11 read with Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act. A revision application to the Sessions Court against the said order of the Metropolitan Magistrate was also dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge relying on the aforementioned decision of this Court in Bajirao's case (1980 Cri LJ 437). Against the said order of the Additional Sessions Judge, the present Revision Application has been filed. 4. Initially this application came before Padhye, J. who in view of the said decision in Bajirao's case referred it to the Division Bench. The Division Bench (Dharmadhikari and Puranik JJ.), by its referring order has referred the matter to this Full Bench as it disagreed with the view taken by this Court earlier in Bajirao's case (1980 Cri LJ 473). 5. As mentioned above, a Division Bench of this Court in its decision in the case of Bajirao v. Tolanbai, (1979 Mah LJ 693) : (1980 Cri LJ 473) on almost similar facts had taken the view that in such circumstances a Hindu woman was not a legally wedded wife, as her marriage with theSmt. Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav vs Anantrao Shivram Adhav And ... on 22 April, 1982 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/458442/ 1respondent was null and void and therefore, cannot claim maintenance under section 125 of the Cr.P. Code on the basis that she was a 'wife'. 6. The reference order shows that the said Division Bench disagreed with the above view earlier taken by the Court in Bajirao's case (1980 Cri LJ 473) because of the object of the Section 125 of the Code, as mentioned by the Supreme Court in its decision in the case of Bhagwan Dutt v. Kamala Devi and in the case of Bai Tahira v. Ali Hussain F. Chothia and certain observations of the Supreme Court in the case of Zohra Khatoon v. Md. Ibrahim to the effect that. ""While enacting Section 125 of Code there was distinct departure from the old Code and the present Code had widened the definition of the term 'wife' and to some extent overruled the present law of the parties so far as proceedings for maintenance under section 125 of the Code were concerned."" The said Division Bench, therefore, appears to have felt that the term 'wife' as appearing in Section 125 of the Code should be broadly construed and not merely restricted to a 'legally wedded wife' and for purpose of claiming maintenance, it should be treated as sufficient if she proves that her marriage was solemnised after following the ceremonies prescribed under the personal law and she has been treated as a wife by the person from whom maintenance was claimed and they were living as husband and wife and were being treated by the public as such. 7. The basic question before us, therefore, is whether the term 'wife' used in Section 125 of the Code was to mean only a legally wedded wife, as held by this Court earlier in Bajirao's case or whether it was to be given an extended meaning, as suggested in the Referring Order ? 8. In fact, the only contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner before us was that looking to the object of Section 125 of the Code, which was to prevent vagrancy, the term 'wife' in Section 125 of the Code should be given a wider or extended meaning so as to include therein not only a 'de jure' or legally wedded wife, but also a 'de facto' wife such as in this case where all the marriage rites prescribed under Hindu Law, by which the parties were governed, were performed, the marriage was registered and the parties had lived as husband and wife, though for one week only after the marriage. The very same contention which was also raised before the Division Bench in Bajirao's case (1980 Cri LJ 473) was negatived by the court. 9. Before dealing with the said contention, the position in law, as arising under Section 125 of the Code and certain provisions of Hindu Marriage Act, which was the personal law governing the parties in this case, be stated : 10. Section 125 of the Code, 1973, in relation to which the present question arises, empowers the Magistrates in certain circumstances stated therein to order maintenance, not exceeding Rs. 500/- p.m., to wives, legitimate or illegitimate children or parents, who are unable to maintain themselves. The said provisions of Section 125 are couched in the same language as Section 488 of the old Code of 1898 with a difference of substance only in two matters. They are :-Smt. Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav vs Anantrao Shivram Adhav And ... on 22 April, 1982 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/458442/ 2(1) Section 125, apart from making provision for wives and children, created a new category of persons viz. parents as being entitled to maintenance under the Code, which was not there under section 488 of the old Code, and; (2) Under explanation Clause (b) to Section 125(1) 'a divorced woman' on certain conditions was specifically included in the term 'wife' while under Sec. 488 of the old Code a 'divorced woman' was not entitled to maintenance."" 11. The object of the provisions of Section 488 of the old Code, corresponding to Section 125 of the present Code was well stated by the Supreme Court in its decision in the case of Bhagwan Dutt v. Smt. Kamladevi as under :- ""Sections 488, 489 and 490 constitute a family. They have been grouped together under Chapter XXXVI of the Code of 1898 under the caption 'of the maintenance of wives and children'. This Chapter in the words of Sir James Fitzstephen provides a mode of preventing vagrancy or at least, preventing its consequences. These provisions are intended to fulfil a social purpose. Their object is to compel a man to perform the moral obligation which he owes to the society in respect of his wife and children by providing a simple, speedy, but limited relief. They week to ensure that neglected wife and children are not left beggered and destituted on scrap heap of society and thereby driven to a life of vagrancy, immorality and crime for their subsistence. Thus Section 488 is not intended to provide for a full and final determination of status and personal rights of the parties. The jurisdiction conferred by the section on the Magistrate is more in the nature of a preventive rather than a remedial jurisdiction. It is certainly not punitive. As pointed out in Thompson's case 6 N.W.P. 205, the scope of Chapter XXXVI is limited and the Magistrate cannot, except as thereunder provided, usurp the jurisdiction in matrimonial disputes possessed by the Civil Courts Sub-section (2) of S. 489 expressly makes the orders passed under Chapter XXXVI of the Code subject to any final adjudication that may be made by a Civil Court between the parties regarding their status and Civil rights."" Above observations restrict the object of Section 488 to the protection of only wives and children. 12. While dealing with the scope of Section 488 the Supreme Court in its decision in the case of Mst. Zohra Khatoon v. Md. Ibrahim with which we will have an occasion to deal later, has in terms pointed out :- ""A perusal of Section 488 would clearly reveal that it carves out an independent sphere of its own and is a general law providing a summary machinery for determining the maintenance to be awarded by the Magistrate under the circumstances mentioned in the Section. The provisions may not be inconsistent with other parallel Acts in so far as maintenance is concerned, but the Section undoubtedly excludes to some extent the application of any other Act. At the same time, it cannot be said that the personal law of the parties is completely excluded for all purposes. For instance, where the validity of marriage or mode of divorce or cessation of marriage under the personal law of the parties is concerned that would have to be determined according to the said personal law. Thus, the exclusion by Section 488 extends only to the quantum of maintenance and the circumstances underSmt.

There  is  no  corresponding provision  under   the  Indian  Divorce  Act  and  a  person obtaining a  decree for  judicial separation  will  have  to remain content with that decree and cannot seek to follow it up with  a decree  of divorce, after the lapse of any period of time.

There is no point or purpose  to be  served by  the continuance  of a marriage which has  so  completely  and  signally  broken  down.  The parties are  bound together by a marital tie which is better untied.

The Order of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY, J. It was just the other day that a Constitution Bench of this Court had to emphasise the urgency of infusing life into Art. 44 of the Constitution which provides that ""The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code through out the territory of India."" The present case is yet another which focuses attention on the immediate and compulsive need for a uniform civil code. The totally unsatisfactory state of affairs consequent on the lack of a uniform civil code is exposed by the facts of the present case. Before mentioning the facts of the case, we might as well refer to the observations of Chandrachud, C.J., in the recent case decided by the Constitution Bench (Mohd Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum & Ors.) ""There is no evidence of any official activity for framing a common civil code for the country ... ... A common Civil Code will help the case of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so. A counsel in the case whispered, somewhat audibly, that legislative competence is one thing, the political courage to use that competence is quite another. We understand the difficulties involved in bringing persons of different faiths and persuasions on a common platform. But, a beginning has to be made if the Constitution is to have any meaning. Inevitably, the role of the reformer has to be assumed by the courts because, it is beyond the endurance of sensitive minds to allow injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable. But piecemeal attempts of courts to bridge the gap between personal laws cannot take the place of a common civil code. Justice to all is a far more satisfactory way of dispensing justice from case to case."" The facts of the case are somewhat novel and peculiar. The wife, who is the petitioner before us claims to belong to the 'Khasi Tribe' of Meghalaya, who was born and brought up as a Presbytarian Christian at Shilong. She is now a member of the Indian Foreign Service. The husband is a Sikh. They were married under the Indian Christen Marriage Act, 1872. The marriage was performed on October 14, 1975. The present petition for declaration of nullity of marriage or judicial separation was filed in 1980 under sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. The prayer for declaration no nullity of marriage was rejected by a learned single judge of the High Court, but a decree for judicial separation was granted on the ground of cruelty. On appeal, a Division Bench of the High Court affirmed the judgment of the learned single judge. The wife has filed this petition for special leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court. She seeks a declaration of nullity of marriage. The ground on which the declaration was sought in the courts below and the ground on which it is now sought is the impotence of the husband in that though the husband is of achieving erection and penetration, he ejaculates prematurely before the wife has an orgasm, leaving the wife totally unsatisfied and frustrated. At this stage, we are not concerned with the question how far the wife has been able to establish her case. The real problem now is that the marriage appears to have broken down irretrievably. Yet if the findings of the High Court stand, there is no way out for the couple, they will continue to be tied to each other since neither mutual consent nor irretrievable break down of marriage is a ground for divorce, under the Indian Divorce Act. Section 10 the Indian Divorce Act prescribes the grounds on which a husband or wife may petition for dissolution of marriage. The ground on which a husband may obtain a decree for dissolution of marriage is theMs. Jordan Diengdeh vs S.S. Chopra on 10 May, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/569459/ 3",['10']

In section 12 it is sa id         that  the ""marriage may be annulled by a decree of  nullit y""         whereas in section 13, the phraseology used is ""dissolved by         a decree of divorce"". Though in substance the meaning of t he         two  may  be different under the circumstances  and  on  t he         facts of each case, but the legal meaning or the effect, is         that  by intervention of the court the relationship  betwe en         two  spouses has been severed either in accordance with  t he         provisions  of section 12 or in accordance with  the  prov i-         sions  of section 13.

However,  barely  three months later, the respondent  husband   filed   a    regular petition  for  divorce  at  Ghaziabad  inter  alia  alleging adultery  against his wife. The appellant-wife  refuted  the charge.  The Court granted her maintenance pendente lite  at Rs.  1,000  p.m.  The husband not paving  this  amount,  the divorce proceedings stand stayed.

She also claimed permanent  alimony and maintenance under S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. On appeal, the High Court held that an application under  S. 25 was not 955 maintainable  as the matrimonial court at amritsar  had  not passed  any  decree  for  restitution  of  conjugal  rights, judicial  separation,  nullity  or  divorce.

Balakrishnan JUDGMENT: K.G. Balakrishnan, J. Leave granted. The husband who had been unsuccessfully fighting litigation for the past more than 15 years for snapping his marital ties with the respondent wife is the appellant before us. The appellant is double doctorate holder -- one in Mathematics from Andhra University and another from U.S.A., and had been working in United States during the relevant period. The respondent is a post- graduate in Home Science and was working as a lecturer in the year 1979. The appellant came to India in 1979 and gave advertisement in the newspaper seeking matrimonial alliance from a suitable bride. The relatives of the respondent responded to the advertisement and there was mutual consultation between the parties, which led to the marriage of the appellant with the respondent on 30.7.1979. After the marriage, the appellant and respondent stayed together for some period and thereafter, the appellant left India for United States. The respondent was asked to join him after having obtained the visa and completing other formalities. The respondent, after a period of six months, joined the appellant in United States. It appears that the marital life of the appellant and the respondent ran into rough weather from the very beginning of their stay in United States. There used to be occasional quarrel between the parties. A daughter, Sandhya, was born to them on 10.6.1981. In 1982, the appellant, respondent and their daughter Sandhya came to India, but the appellant returned to United States in November 1982 itself and the respondent joined him only in April 1983. In January 1985, the respondent along with her daughter returned to India and it seems that theG.V.N. Kameswara Rao vs G. Jabilli on 10 January, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1386587/ 1misunderstandings between the parties deepened and ultimately the appellant filed application for divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 alleging that after the solemnization of their marriage, the respondent treated the appellant with cruelty. The respondent contested the proceedings and denied all the allegations made by the appellant in the petition and also made counter-allegations alleging that the appellant was responsible for wrecking the marriage. Parties on either side examined witnesses to substantiate their allegations. The learned Family Court Judge after assessing the rival contentions and the evidence adduced by the parties, came to the conclusion that the respondent had treated the appellant with mental cruelty and, therefore, the appellant was entitled to get a decree for dissolution of marriage. This was challenged by the respondent before the Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Division Bench of the High Court reversed the decision of the Family Court holding that the appellant was at fault and he had been trying to take advantage of his own wrongs; hence, he was not entitled to get a decree in his favour in view of Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Judgment of the Division Bench is challenged before us. We heard learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, Mr. L. Nageswara Rao and Mr. M.N. Rao, learned Counsel on behalf of the respondent. The learned senior Counsel for the appellant contended that there was complete breakdown of the marriage due to the attitude of the respondent and the appellant was under severe mental agony and that the various acts committed by the respondent amounted to mental cruelty and the High Court was not justified in reversing the finding of the Family Court. The learned Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that there were differences of opinion between the appellant and the respondent on many matters, but the respondent had not done anything to cause mental pain or agony to the appellant. It was argued that the Family Court Judge passed his decision based on a solitary incident and, therefore, the same had been rightly reversed by the High court. For proper appreciation of the disputes between the parties, it is necessary to consider the various allegations made by the appellant in his petition and also the counter-allegations made by the respondent in her reply. The appellant alleged that respondent entered into marriage with the appellant because of the persuasion of her sisters and brother and that the respondent was not taking any interest or co-operating to have a happy married life. The appellant alleged that the respondent joined him in the United States after a period of six months unwillingly, and right from the beginning of her life in United States, she picked up quarrel with the appellant and created scenes on many occasions. The appellant alleged that it was known to the Indian community, mainly to the people of Andhra Pradesh, who had settled down in and around the area where the appellant was residing, that the respondent was not having a good relationship with the appellant. He also alleged that the respondent was not doing any household work and the appellant had to do all the work himself and his brother Ravi, who was staying with him, was helping him. The appellant alleged that the respondent used to insult the appellant in the presence of his friends and guests and that the respondent was taking no interest in sharing bed with the appellant and this caused mental and physical agony to the appellant.G.V.N. Kameswara Rao vs G. Jabilli on 10 January, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1386587/ 2The respondent had denied all these allegations made by the appellant in the petition and she also made counter-allegations. But it is pertinent to note that the respondent has no case that they were having a happy married life and the attempt of the respondent was to put the blame at the doorstep of the appellant. She stated that the appellant had no interest to live with the respondent and was all the time attending parties, watching TV and playing cards and the respondent was completely neglected by the appellant. The respondent alleged that the appellant used to treat her as an intruder. The respondent also stated that she was not given proper medical aid when she was in labour pain and had to give pre-mature birth to the baby without any medical assistance. It is true that the Family Court rightly found that all the allegations made by the appellant in the petition were not satisfactorily substantiated by him. But nevertheless, some glaring facts are to be noted in this case. The married life of the appellant and respondent started in 1979 and right from the very beginning, the parties were under severe mental stress. Both the parties mutually tried to put the blame on each other. In 1982, the appellant, the respondent and their daughter returned to India. The respondent, however, refused to accompany the appellant back to the United States, and according to the appellant, she threw up the visa and other papers at him and joined him in United States only in 1983 and the subsequent evidence shows that the respondent had not willingly joined the appellant. She came back to India with her daughter in 1985. Though the appellant stated that the appellant's nephew, Ramu received her, she refused to talk to him and left with her own relatives. The respondent has denied these facts. However, it is important to note that the appellant has alleged that he did not know the whereabouts of the respondent and his child, at least for some period, after they returned to India. This is evident from the fact that the appellant wrote two letters to his daughter and these letters had to be re-directed to the address of the appellant. She was staying at Araku Valley, which was evidently not known to the appellant. The appellant stated that he suffered severe mental torture and, only after some searching inquiry, he could come to know that she was staying with her sister at Araku Valley. The appellant along with his two relatives went to Araku Valley to persuade the respondent to join the society of the appellant, but the very entry of the appellant and his relatives to the house was prevented by the respondent and later, only at the intervention of her sister, Suryakantham, they were permitted to enter the house. It may be noticed that the respondent and her child left United States in January 1985. The nature of the treatment meted out to the appellant by the respondent, even when he was meeting her after an interval of one year, is satisfactorily proved by the evidence of PW4 and his evidence was completely accepted by the Family Court Judge. The appellant being highly educated person having a position in life must have felt serious humiliation. The incident also shows that the respondent did not extend courteous behaviour to the appellant even in the presence of others. The conduct of the respondent assumes importance as this incident happened when they both were meeting each other after a long lapse of time. Another important incident, which found favour with the Family Court is that the respondent had filed a criminal complaint before the police alleging that she was beaten by the appellant and his mother. The appellant and his mother were called to the police station and they had to be there for more than 10 hours. The explanation offered by the respondent for this incident is far from satisfactory. According to the respondent, she was being ill-treated by the appellant and his mother, and on one day, while preparing the breakfast when she used the blender for grinding the pulses,G.V.N.

And, that is how a person would feel on being bastardized by a court verdict. disentitling him from inheriting the properties left by his father. This is the theme of the present judgement which we are required to write in view of the following facts :-Smt. Parayankandiyal ... vs K. Devi & Ors on 26 April, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/391843/ 12. Parayankandiyil Kanhirakunnath Kurungodan Raman Nair was the proud father of 14 children from two wives, the first being Ammu Amma, who is the mother of the respondents 1 to 9, and the second being a lady of equally long name, namely, Smt. Parayankandiyal Eravath Kanapravan Kalliani Amma (appellant No. l), who is the mother of appellants 2 to 6. He had a flair for two; two wives, two sets of children, two sets of properties, in two different States. P.K.K. Raman Nair died on 9th January, 1975, and since he left behind considerable movable and immovable properties in the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, litigation was the usual and destined calamity to befall the children for settling the question of inheritance. 3. The litigation started with the filing of O.S. No. 38 of 1976 and O.S. No. 39 of 1976 in the court of Subordinate Judge at Badagara, Kerala, by the respondents for a decree for possession over certain properties, which allegedly were in the possession of the appellants, and for half share by partition in the tenancy land held in common by late P.K.K. Raman Nair with his second wife, namely, appellant No.1. The appellants did not lag behind and they filed a suit (O.S. No. 99 of 1977) for partition of the properties of late P.K.K. Raman Nair, which were said to be in the possession of the respondents. 4. Respondents had instituted the suits on the basis of their title, with the allegations that the appellant Nos. 2 to 6 and their mother, namely, appellant No. 1, were not the legal heirs of Raman Nair, while the appellants had instituted their suit (O.S.No. 99 of 1977 ) for partition of the properties indicated in schedules A,B & C to the plaint, on the ground that they being the legal heirs of Raman Nair were entitled to a share in the properties left by him along with the respondents. 5. All the three suits were tried together by the trial court and were dismissed with the finding that the second marriage of Raman Nair with appellant No. 1 had taken place at a time when his first wife, Ammu Amma, was alive and, therefore, it was invalid, with the result that the appellant nos. 2 to 6, who were the children born of the second marriage would not inherit any share in properties left by Raman Nair. 6. Three appeals were consequently filed in the High Court and the only question urged before the High Court was that the second wife and children were also the legal heirs of Raman Nair, but the High Court by its impugned judgment and order dated 22.6.1989 dismissed the appeals with littled modification that the house in the plaint schedule property in O.S. No. 39 of 1976 was directed to be allotted. as far as possible. to appellant No. 1 as she was living in that house with her children. Hence these appeals. 7. Mr. P. S . Poti, Sr. Advocate. appearing on behalf of the appellants. has contended that the trial court as also the High Court were in error in dismissing the suit of the appellants for partition of their share in the properly as the appellants were the legal heirs of Raman Nair and the inheritance could not be denied to them merely on the ground of his second marriage with appellant No.1. particularly as Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 specifically provides that, notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void, any child of such marriage, who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate and get an interest in the property ofSmt. Parayankandiyal ... vs K. Devi & Ors on 26 April, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/391843/ 2his parents, but not in the property of any other person. 8. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, on the contrary, is that benefit of Section 16 can be given only to such marriages as are null and void under Section 11 of the Hindu marriage Act. 1955 and not to any other marriage. His contention further is that a marriage would be null and void under Section ll only If it is performed after the coming into force of the Act and. therefore, all other marriages which were performed prior to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, would not be covered by Section 16 and children born of such marriage would not be entitled to the benefit of statutory legitimacy or inheritance. 9. It may be mentioned that one of the contentions raised before the High Court was that if the benefit of legitimacy contemplated by Section 16 of the Act is not extended to children born of the second or invalid marriages held prior to the Act, the provisions would have to be struck down as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, inasmuch as they purport to create two classes of illegitimate children, namely. those born of the invalid marriages prior to the Act and those born of the void marriages performed after the enforcement of the Act. This was not accepted by the High Court which was of the opinion that the provisions of Section 16 were not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. 10. Marriage, according to Hindu Law, is a holy union. It is not a contract but a Sanskara or sacrament. 11. The religious rites solemnizing a marriage include certain vows and prayers by the parties ""In the three mantras of Laja (parched paddy) Hawan, the bride says :- ""I give oblation to the Fire God, the destroyer of enemies. With the grace of the said destroyer of enemies, may I never be separated from my husband's house. Other unmarried girls have worshipped the Fire God, the sustainer of the earth, for the fulfillment of their desire. Knowing that their desire were fulfilled, I have also made an oblation, may the same Fire God, sustainer of the earth, be pleased and with his grace may I never be separated from my husband's house. I worship Shankar in the form of Fire God, the god of good repute and the protector of husband. May by the grace of Shankar, the Fire God, I and my husband be freed from death as the ripe melon is freed from its knot in the creeper.

This is a husband's appeal preferred to this Court against an order made by the Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad dismissing his application filed under S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolving his marriage with his respondent-wife. The petitioning husband is the respondent's maternal uncle. This appears to be a case of familiarity breeding contempt rendering attraction of novelty absent. The parties are Hindus and their marriage took place on 19th Feb., 1978. But ever thereafter, they do not appear to have lived for long happily together. The husband alleged in his petition filed for divorce that his wife was in love with one S even prior to her marriage with him and that she was living on terms of illicit intimacy with the said S both before and after her marriage. The petitioner alleged that the wife admitted her illicit relationship with S to him. The husband alleged that he was satisfied that the respondent-wife was trying to snap her relations with him somehow. The respondent had been living away from her husband and with her parents from Jan. 1980, without ever visiting the petitioner except once in the month of July 1980 for just five minutes when the petitioner lost his father. The husband alleged that since January 1980 the parties were living apart and that there was no possibility of reconciliation between them and that the efforts made by the elders for bringing reconciliation between them had failed. The husband also alleged that the petitioner and the respondent agreed for having a divorce by mutual consent and that a draft petition in that behalf was also prepared for being submitted to the Court. The husband alleged that as the respondent went back upon that agreement, he had no other go except to file the application for divorce. 2. On the other hand the respondent in her counter blamed the husband for the unhappy state of affairs existing between them. She said that it was the husband who was causing inexpressable agony and distress to her. The wife asserted that the husband was making against her reckless allegations of illicit intimacy with the abovesaid S. She disowned love with S. In her turn, she imputed illicit intimacy of her husband with a Gujarati lady and said that because of that relationship, the petitioner was 'seeking divorce with her. The respondent denied ever having admitted her relationship with S. But the respondent did not deny the fact that they were living apart from January. 3. The above petition for divorce was filed sometime in the year 1982. It dragged on for over an year. When the matter came up for trial, the lower Court framed the necessary issues and examined three witnesses for the husband and two witnesses for the wife and marked Exs. A.1, A.2, A.3, A.4 and A.5 documents Exs. A.2 and A.4 are the letters said to have been written by the abovementioned S to the respondent-wife. 4. The lower Court, on assessment of the evidence, held that the petitioner-husband had failed to make out a case for dissolution of the marriage with the respondent. Accordingly, the learned JudgeK. Omprakash vs K. Nalini on 15 July, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1170645/ 1dismissed on 10-8-1983. Against that order, the husband has filed this appeal which has been admitted by this Court on 5th Dec. 1983. 5. Now the parties have filed in this Court on 12th July, 1985 a compromise memo signed by both the parties and their respective lawyers praying that this Court may pass a decree for divorce declaring the marriage between the parties to be dissolved by mutual consent ignoring the aforementioned allegations and counter allegations made by the parties. 6. In the circumstances mentioned above, we entertain no doubt that it would be in the best interests of the parties to order the dissolution of the marriage. We are of the clear opinion that the marriage. We are of the clear opinion that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and that there is no reasonable chance for reunion of the parties. They have been living apart for the last 41/2 years. Any prolongation of the legal status of marriage is not likely to bring about reconciliation. It can only help to accentuate their unhappiness by further fomenting their mutual jealousies. This long separation strengthened by the serious charges of unfaithfulness made against each other must have drained off the matrimony its last drops of sweetness. The parties are fighting relentlessly in Courts against each other on the basis of those allegations for over a period of two years. In these circumstances, we are clearly of the opinion that the present application made by the parties for dissolution of the marriage under S. 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act is not the result of any collusion between the parties not was it the result of any passing phase of mental agony or temporary feeling of unhappiness. We have no doubt that the differences between the parties are long-standing and deep rooted and that this Court would only be acting just to decree dissolution of the marriage here and new on the basis of their mutual consent. 7. It may be noted that the parties are not only agreeable to an instant divorce but even eager and anxious to have such a decree of divorce by mutual consent here and now. The question then is whether S. 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act under which divorce by mutual consent can be granted, permits the granting of such decree of divorce in this case? 8. S. 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, reads as follows :-- ""S. 13-B(2) Divorce by mutual consent : (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the District Court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage was solemnized, before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more; that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved; (2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of presentation of the petition referred to in sub-sec. (1) and not later than eighteen months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the Court shall on being satisfied after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit that a marriage has been solemnized and thatK. Omprakash vs K. Nalini on 15 July, 1985 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1170645/ 2the averments in the petition are true, pass a decree for divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of decree."" 9. Section 13-B is introduced into the statute book by means of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976. It permits, for the first time, dissolution of a Hindu marriage by mutual consent of parties, provided the parties have been living separately after their marriage for a period of one year or more and that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. S. 13-B radically altered the legal basis of a Hindu marriage by treating it asan ordinary form of contract which competent parties can enter into and put an end to like any other contract by mutual consent. Just as the parties can obtain a consent decree from the courts under O. 23, R.3 C.P.C., so they can now under S. 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act obtain a consent divorce. Sri S. V. Gupte in his Hindu Law 3rd (1981) edition, Vol. 2, page 800, commenting on this change, wrote: ""This is a very radical amendment as it enables divorce by consent. It also virtually puts a death-nail on the old concept of Hindu Law and Hindu morality that marriage is a sacrament and not a contract."" However, a petition filed for divorce by consent under S. 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act is required to be kept in abeyance for a minimum period of six months. This is in sharp contrast with a petition filed for divorce by consent under Special Marriage Act which is liable to be kept in abeyance at least for one year. This liberalising trend of law in the matter of granting divorce by consent cannot be lost sight by Courts in interpreting that section. But even then Cl. (2) of S. 13-B requires a Court not to pass a decree for divorce before six months of time lapses and after 18 months of time passes from the date of filing of such a petition for divorce by mutual consent. This is the last hope of the legislature for saving the marriage. The intention of the legislature is to provide a minimum period of six months for re-thinking of the parties. If the above time-table fixed by S. 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act is applied to the present application made by the parties in this case on 12th July 1985. We have to adjourn this case till January, 1986 for passing a decree for divorce under that section, notwithstanding the fact that we are of the opinion that there is no chance of reconciliation between the parties who have been living away from each other for the last 41/2 years and are today most anxious and ready to obtain such a decree here and now. That situation raises somewhat an important legal question as to the meaning which we should attribute to S. 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act. That question is whether the Legislature intended that  S. 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act should be treated as a mandatory provision of law or the Legislature intended that section to be treated merely as a directory provision of law. We have already noticed the language of  S. 13-B(2). On first impression it is not impossible to hold S. 13-B(2) to be mandatory. As a mandatory provision of law calls for its pound of flesh and requires to be complied strictly and it not being satisfied with offerings of more substantial compliance of its commands, we will have to adjourn this matter for six months and postpone the deliverance to the parties from this deadlock by the that period of time (sic). It is well-settled proposition of law that a statutory provision, though mandatory in form, can yet be treated as directory in substance. The question then arises whether there is anything in the text of S. 13-B(2) of its context or purpose or design that calls for S. 13-B(2) being interpreted as directory?

Saghir Ahmad, J. 1. I respectfully agree with the views expressed by my esteemed Brother, Sethi, J., in the erudite judgment prepared by him, by which the Writ Petitions and the Review Petition are being disposed of finally. I, however, wish to add a few words of my own. 2. Smt. Sushmita Ghosh, who is the wife of Shri G.C. Ghosh (Mohd. Karim Ghazi) filed a Writ Petition [W.P.(C) No. 509 of 1992] in this Court stating that she was married to Shri G.C. Ghosh in accordance with the Hindu rites on 10th May, 1984 and since then both of them were happily living at Delhi. The following paragraphs of the Writ Petition, which are relevant for this case, are quoted below. 15. That around the 1st of April, 1992, the Respondent No. 3 told the petitioner that she should in her own interest agree to her divorce by mutual consent as he had any way taken to Islam so that he may remarry and in fact he had already fixed to marry one Miss Vanita Gupta resident of D-152 Preet Vihar, Delhi, a divorcee with two children in the second week of July 1992. The Respondent No. 3 also showed a Certificate issued by office of the Maulana Qari Mohammad Idris, Shahi Qazi dated 17th June, 1992 certifying that the Respondent No. 3 had embraced Islam. True copy of the Certificate is annexed to the present petition and marked as Annexure-II. 16. That the petitioner contacted her father and aunt and told them about her husband's conversion and intention to remarry. They all tried to convince the Respondent No. 3 and talk him out of the marriage but of no avail and he insisted that Sushmita must agree to her divorce otherwise she will have to put up with second wife. 17. That it may be stated that the Respondent No. 3 has converted to Islam solely for the purpose of re-marrying and has no real faith in Islam. He does not practice the Muslim rites as prescribed nor has he changed his name or religion and other official documents. 18. That the petitioner asserts her fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 15(1) not to be discriminated against on the ground of religion and sex alone. She avers that she has been discriminated against by that part of Muslim Personal Law which is enforced by the State Action by issue of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act, 1937. It is submitted that such action is contrary to Article 13(1) and is unconstitutional. 19. That the truth of the matter is that Respondent No. 3 has adopted the Muslim religion and became a convert to that religion for the sole purpose of having a second wife which is forbiddenLily Thomas, Etc. Etc. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 5 April, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80351/ 1strictly under the Hindu Law. It need hardly be said that the said conversion was not a matter of Respondent No. 3 having faith in the Muslim religion. 20. The petitioner is undergoing great mental trauma. She is 34 years of age and is not employed anywhere. 21. That in the past several years, it has become very common amongst the Hindu males who cannot get a divorce from their first wife, they convert to Muslim religion solely for the purpose of marriage. This practice is invariably adopted by those erring husband who embrace Islam for the purpose of second marriage but again become reconvert so as to retain their rights in the properties etc. and continue their service and all other business in their old name and religion. 22. That a Woman's Organisation ""Kalyani"" terribly perturbed over this growing menace and increase in number of desertions of the lawfully married wives under the Hindu Law and splitting up and ruining of the families even where there are children and when no grounds of obtaining a divorce successfully on any of the grounds enumerated in Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is available to resort to conversion as a method to get rid of such lawful marriages, has filed a petition in this Hon'ble Court being Civil Writ Petition No. 1079 of 1989 in which this Hon'ble Court has been pleased to admit the same. True copy of the order dated 23.4.90 and the order admitting the petition is annexed to the present petition and marked as Annexure-III (Collectively) 3. She ultimately prayed for the following reliefs: (a) by an appropriate writ, order or direction, declare polygamy marriages by Hindus and non-Hindus after conversion to Islam religion are illegal and void; (b) Issue appropriate directions to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to carry out suitable amendments in the Hindu Marriage Act so as to curtail and forbid the practice of polygamy; (c) Issue appropriate direction to declare that where a non Muslim male gets converted to the ""Muslim"" faith without any real change of belief and merely with a view to avoid an earlier marriage or enter into a second marriage, any marriage entered into by him after conversion would be void; (d) Issue appropriate direction to Respondent No. 3 restraining him from entering into any marriage with Miss"" Vanita Gupta or any other woman during the subsistence of his marriage with the petitioner; and (e) pass such other and further order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case. 4. This Petition was filed during the summer vacation in 1992. Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah (as he then was), sitting as Vacation Judge, passed the following order on 9th July, 1992:Lily Thomas, Etc. Etc. vs Union Of India & Ors. on 5 April, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80351/ 2The Writ Petition is taken on board. Heard Mr. Mahajan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner. Issue notice. Learned Counsel says that the respondent who was a Hindu by religion and who has been duly and legally married to the petitioner purports to have changed his religion and embraced Islam and that he has done only with a view to take another wife, which would otherwise be an illegal bigamy. Petitioner prays that there should be interdiction of the proposed second marriage which is scheduled to take place tomorrow i.e. 10th July, 1992. It is urged that the respondent, whose marriage with the petitioner is legal and subsisting cannot take advantage of the feigned conversion so as to be able to take a second wife. All that needs to be said at this stage is that if during the pendency of this writ petition, the respondent proceeds to contract a second marriage and if it is ultimately held that respondent did not have the legal capacity for the second marriage, the purported marriage would be void. 5. On 17th July, 1992, when this case was taken up, the following order was passed: Counter affidavit shall be filed in four weeks. Place this matter before a Bench of which Hon'ble Pandian, J. is a member. Shri Mahajan submitted that since the apprehended second marriage has not yet taken place, it is appropriate that we stop the happening of that event till disposal of this petition. Learned Counsel for the respondent-husband says that he would file a counter affidavit within four weeks. He assures that his client would not enter into a marriage in hurry before the counter-affidavit is filed. 6. On 30th November, 1992, this Writ Petition was directed to be tagged with Writ Petition (C) No. 1079/89 (Smt. SarlaMudgal, President, ""Kalyani"" and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. and W.P. (Civil) No. 347/90 Sunita @ Fatima v. Union of India and Ors.. 7. It may be stated that on 23rd April,1990 when the Writ Petition (C) No. 10797 89 and Writ Petition (C) No. 347/90 were taken up together, the Court had passed the following order: Issue Notice to respondent No. 3 returnable within twelve weeks in both the Writ Petitions. Learned Counsel for the petitioners in the Writ Petitions, after taking instructions, states that the prayers in both the writ petitions are limited to a single relief, namely, a declaration that where a non-Muslim male gets converted to the Muslim faith without any real change of belief and merely with a view to avoid any earlier marriage or to enter into a second marriage any marriage entered into by him after conversion would be void. 8. Thus, in view of the pleadings in Smt. Sushmita Ghosh's case and in view of the order passed by this Court in the Writ Petitions filed separately by Smt. Sarla Mudgal and Ms. Lily Thomas, the principal question which was required to be answered by this Court was that where a non-Muslim gets converted to the 'Muslim' faith without any real change or belief and merely with a view to avoid an earlier marriage or to enter into a second marriage, whether the marriage entered into by him after conversion would be void?Lily Thomas, Etc.

The position of stridhan  of a  Hindu  married  woman's  property  during coverture is  absolutely clear  and unambiguous;  she is the absolute owner  of such property and can deal with it in any manner she  likes-She may  spend the  whole of it or give it away at  her own  pleasure  by  gift  or  will  without  any reference to  her husband. The entrustment to the husband of the stridhan  property is just like something which the wife keeps in  a bank  and can  withdraw any amount when ever she likes  without  any  hitch  or  hindrance.  Ordinarily,  the husband has  no right  or  interest  in  it  with  the  sole exception that in times of extreme distress, as 193 in famine,  illness or  the like, the husband can utilize it but he  is morally  bound to restore it or its value when he is able  to do  so. This  right is  purely personal  to  the husband and  the property  so received  by him  in  marriage cannot be  proceeded against  even in  execution of a decree for debt.

MATHUR & DALVEER BHANDARI JUDGMENT: J U D G M E N T Dalveer Bhandari, J This appeal is directed against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated 07.07.2003 passed by the Division Bench in First Appeal No.323 of 2003. The appellant and the respondent are husband and wife. The appellant has filed a petition under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for divorce. The Family Court after comprehensively dealing with the matter ordered cancellation of marriage between the parties under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act which was solemnized on 20.11.1975 and directed the appellant to pay Rs.5 lacs as her livelihood allowance. The appellant deposited the amount as directed. The respondent aggrieved by the said judgment preferred First Appeal before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court. After hearing the parties the appeal was allowed and the decree passed by the Family Court, Kanpur City seeking divorce and annulment of the marriage was dismissed. The appellant aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court had preferred special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. This Court granted special leave to appeal to the appellant. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are recapitulated. The appellant, Naveen Kohli got married to Neelu Kohli on 20.11.1975. Three sons were born out of the wedlock of the parties. The appellant constructed three factories with the intention of providing a separate factory for his three sons. He also constructed bungalow no.7/36 A for their residence. The parties got all their three sons admitted and educated in a public school in Nanital. According to the appellant, the respondent is bad tempered and a woman of rude behaviour. After marriage, she started quarrelling and misbehaving with the appellant and his parents and ultimately, the appellant was compelled to leave the parental residence and started to reside in a rented premises from May 1994. According to the version of the appellant, the respondent in collusion with her parents gotNaveen Kohli vs Neelu Kohli on 21 March, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1643829/ 1sufficient business and property transferred in her name. The appellant alleged that in the month of May 1994, when he along with the respondent and their children visited Bombay to attend the golden jubilee marriage anniversary of his father-in-law, he noticed that the respondent was indulging in an indecent manner and found her in a compromising position with one Biswas Rout. Immediately thereafter, the appellant started living separately from the respondent since May 1994. The appellant suffered intense physical and mental torture. According to the appellant, the respondent had withdrawn Rs.9,50,000/- from the Bank Account of the appellant and deposited the same in her account. The appellant alleged that the respondent got a false first information report registered against him under Sections 420/467/468 and 471 IPC which was registered as Case No.156 of 1995. According to him, the respondent again got a case under Sections 323/324 I.P.C. registered in the police station Panki, Kanpur City and efforts were made to get the appellant arrested. The appellant filed a Civil Suit No. 1158/1996 against the respondent. It was also reported that the appellant was manhandled at the behest of the respondent and an FIR No.156 of 1996 was filed by the eldest son at the behest of the respondent against the appellant in police station, Panki complaining that the appellant had physically beaten her son, Nitin Kohli. The respondent in her statement before the Trial Court had mentioned that she had filed an FIR against the appellant under Section 420/468 IPC at the Police Station, Kotwali and the respondent had gone to the extent of filing a caveat in the High Court in respect of the said criminal case so that the appellant may not obtain an order from the High Court against her filing the said FIR. In the same statement, the respondent had admitted that she had filed an FIR No.100/96 at the Police Station, Kohna under Section 379/323 IPC against the appellant. The respondent had also filed a complaint against the appellant and his mother under Sections 498A/323/504/506 IPC at Police Station, Kohna. The respondent in her statement had admitted that she had opposed the bail of the appellant in the criminal case filed at the Police Station, Kotwali on the basis of legal advice. In that very statement she further admitted that after the police had filed final report in both the criminal cases relating to Police Station, Kotwali and Police Station, Kohna, she had filed protest petition in those cases. This clearly demonstrates the respondent's deep and intense feeling of revenge. The respondent in her statement had also admitted that she had filed a complaint in the Women Cell, Delhi in September 1997. According to the appellant, the respondent had filed a complaint no.125 of 1998 against the appellant's lawyer and friend alleging criminal intimidation which was found to be false. According to the appellant, the respondent filed a forged complaint under sections 397/398 of the Companies Act before the Company Law Board, New Delhi and in the affidavit of the respondentNaveen Kohli vs Neelu Kohli on 21 March, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1643829/ 2she stated that the appellant was immoral, alcoholic, and was having affairs with numerous girls since marriage. She also called him a criminal, infidel, forger and her manager to denigrate his position from the proprietor to an employee of her company. The appellant also mentioned that the respondent filed a false complaint in Case No.1365 0f 1988 using all kinds of abuses against the appellant. On 8.7.1999, the respondent filed a complaint in the Parliament Street Police Station, New Delhi and made all efforts to ensure the appellant's arrest with the object of sending him to jail. The appellant was called to the police station repeatedly and was interrogated by the police and only after he gave a written reply and the matter on scrutiny was found to be false, the appellant with great difficulty was able to save himself from imprisonment. On 31.3.1999 the respondent had sent notice for breaking the Nucleus of the HUF, expressly stating that the Family Nucleus had been broken with immediate effect and asking for partition of all the properties and assets of the HUF and stating that her share should be given to her within 15 days. According to the appellant, this act of the respondent clearly broke all relations between the appellant and the respondent on 31.3.1999. The respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act directing payment of maintenance during the pendency of the case. This was rejected by the Trial Court and she later filed an appeal in the High Court. The appellant had deposited Rs.5 lacs on Court's directions but that amount was not withdrawn by the respondent. On 22.1.2001 the respondent gave an affidavit before the High Court and got non-bailable warrants issued against the appellant. Consequently, the appellant was harassed by the police and ultimately he got the arrest order stayed by the High Court. The respondent admitted in her statement that she got the advertisement published in the English National Newspaper 'Pioneer'. The advertisement reads as under : PUBLIC NOTICE Be it known to all that Mr. Naveen Kohli S/o Mr. Prem Kumar Kohli was working with my Proprietorship firm as Manager. He has abandoned his job since May 1996 and has not resumed duties. He is no more in the employment of the firm.

But, in reality, whether the said object is anywhere near accomplishment? Nodding her head in the negative, a woman , who is locked in a matrimonial dispute, has come up with this Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution seeking a direction for speedy disposal. 2. The first petitioner in this Civil Revision Petition is the wife of the respondent and the second petitioner is their minor daughter. The respondent has filed H.M.O.P.No.137 of 2010 before the Family Court, Coimbatore, seeking a decree of divorce. While so, the petitioners herein have filed I.A.No.1924 of 2010 seeking alimony pendente lite and also litigation expenses. To be precise, the wife claims interim alimony of Rs.31,000/- per month and the daughter claims a sum of Rs.3,700/- per month and Rs.35,100/- towards yearly expenses to the wife and Rs.28,600/- towards yearly expenses of the daughter and Rs.5,000/- towards the litigation expenses. The said Interlocutory Application is still pending along with H.M.O.P.No.137 of 2010. At this stage, the petitioners have come up with this Civil Revision Petition seeking a direction to the Family Court to dispose of I.A.No.1924 of 2010 within a time frame to be fixed by this Court. 3. This Civil Revision Petition has come up for admission. I have heard the learned counsel Mr.R.Sankaranarayanan assisted by Ms.K.Sumathi for the petitioner and I have also perused the records carefully. No notice is ordered to the respondent as this order will not in any manner be prejudicial to the interest of the respondent. 4. As I have already pointed out, I.A.No.1924 of 2010 has been filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) both by the wife and the daughter of the respondent jointly. During the course of hearing, a doubt arose in the mind of this Court as to how a daughter of the litigating spouses can be a party to a petition under Section 24 of the Act, claiming maintenance pendente lite. Therefore, this Court invited the learned counsel for the petitioner to advance arguments on the very maintainability of the Interlocutory Application under Section 24 of the Act by the daughter. 5. In this regard, before entering upon any further discussion, let us have a look into Section 24 of the Act which reads as follows:- 4. Maintenance Pendente lite and expenses proceedings-. Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner' s own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the court to be reasonable: Provided that the application for the payment of the expenses of the proceeding and such monthly sum during the proceeding, shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of service of notice on the wife or the husband, as the case may be.S.Sumathi vs R.Sharavanakumar on 30 April, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26407098/ 26. A plain reading of the above provision would show that a claim for maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses can be filed either by the wife or by the husband against the other and by none else. The phrase in the opening sentence of Section 24 of the Act either the wife or the husband will reflect the same. Thus, at the first blush, it gives an impression that such a claim for maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses can be made only by the wife or the husband for herself or himself, as the case may be, and not for the children. 7. This question came up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jasbir Kaur Sehgal v. District Judge, Dehradun (AIR 1997 SC 3397). Factually, in the said case, a Hindu wife was awarded maintenance pendente lite of Rs.2,500/- per month under Section 24 of the Act and Rs.1,000/- towards litigation expenses by the trial court. The same was reduced by the High Court to Rs.1,500/- per month. Challenging the same, the wife took up the matter to the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it was contended that she had an unmarried daughter who was also under her care and custody. Her grievance was that the Court below did not take into account the fact that she had to maintain the unmarried daughter. It was opposed by the husband on the ground that a petition under Section 24 of the Act cannot be over stretched to order for maintenance pendente lite in favour of the child. The further argument was that such maintenance for the child can be claimed only under Section 26 of the Act. On considering the said contention, the Hon'ble Supreme Court answered the question in paragraph No.6 as follows:- ..............Section 24 of the Act no doubt talks of maintenance of wife during the pendency of the proceedings but this section, in our view, cannot be read in isolation and cannot be given restricted meaning to hold that it is the maintenance of the wife alone and no one else. Since wife is maintaining the eldest unmarried daughter, her right to claim maintenance would include her own maintenance and that of her daughter. This fact has to be kept in view while fixing the maintenance pendente lite for the wife. We are aware of the provisions of Section 26 of the Act providing for custody of minor children, their maintenance and education but that section operates in its own field. 8. From the above judgment, it is crystal clear that an order for maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses can be made only in favour of the wife/husband as the case may be. But, while fixing the maintenance pendente lite for the wife/husband, the Court is required to keep in view the fact that there is a child who also needs the support of the wife or husband, as the case may be. Thus, a petition under Section 24 of the Act, can be filed by the wife/husband claiming maintenance pendente lite and in order to arrive at a just amount, she/he can plead that she/he has got a child also to maintain. 9. In such a petition filed under Section 24 of the Act, except the wife or the husband, as the case may be, none else can be the petitioner/claimant. 10. Now, let us now have a look into Section 26 of the Act which reads as follows:- 6. Custody of children-. In any proceeding under this Act, the court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper withS.Sumathi vs R.Sharavanakumar on 30 April, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26407098/ 3","['26', '24']"
352,"Bombay High Court Vera Aranha vs Jacob Harlad Aranha on 26 June, 1987 Equivalent citations: (1987) 89 BOMLR 402 Author: Guttal Bench: B Sawant, G Guttal JUDGMENT Guttal, J. 1. This Appeal has been placed before us upon a reference made by Daud, J., made on 13th March, 1987, The facts giving rise to this reference are as under:-- The appellant, who is the wife of the respondent to this appeal, instituted M.J. Petition No. 714 of 1977 for divorce on the grounds that the respondent husband was guilty of adultery and cruelty. The parties are Indian Christinas and are governed by the Indian Divorce Act (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act""). During the pendency of the M.J. Petition No. 714, the appellant made a petition viz., No. 77 of 1982 for alimoney pendente lite under S. 36 of the Act. On 25th January 1983, the Bombay City Civil court, lwhere M.J. Petition No,. 714 of 1977 was sent for trial and disposal , made an order awarding a sum of Rs.100/- to the appellant as interim alimony. On 28th January 1983, the same Court allowed a sum of Rs.750/- towards the expenses to prosecute the petition. On the same day, M.J. Petition No. 714 of 1977 was disposed of by a decree of divorce in favour of the appellant. In this appeal, the order of the Bombay City Civil Court dated 25th January, 1983 awarding interim alimony of Rs.100/- p.m. is impugned. This first appeal was filed on 21st March, 1983. An appeal by the respondent challenging the decree of divorce is pending in this Court. The petitioner-appellant claims that the amount of Rs.100/- is not commensurate with the income of the respondent. 2. When the appeal was called out for hearing before Daud, J, the respondent urged that in view of S. 55 of the Act and the judgment by a single Judge of this Court in Prithvirasinghji v. Bai jShiva Prabhakumar, AIR 1960 Bom 315 the order granting interim alimony was not appealable. On consideration of S. 28, Hindu Marriage Act, as it then stood, and which is pari materia with S. 55 of the Act,Gokhle, J. held that the appeal against an order of interim alimony was not maintainable. In Lallubhai v. Nirmalaben a contrary view was taken and it was held that the order of interim alimony was appealable. Daud, J. who was inclined to accept the view of the Gujarat High Court, found it difficult to do so in view of the judgment delivered by Gokhale, J. He, therefore, referred this appeal to the Division Bench by his order dated 13th March, 1987. 3. Daud, J, has not formulated the question referred to us. In order to focus attention on the exact question referred to us, we formulate the question as under:-- ""Having regard to the provisions of S. 55, Divorce Act, is an order of alimoney pendente lite, made under S. 36 of the Act, appealable?"" 4. Three sections of the Act are relevant for the consideration of the question that has been referred to us. We will briefly set out the substance of these sections. Section 36 provides that in any suit under the Act, the wife may present a petition for alimony pending the suit. Section 45, which appears in Part XII under the caption ""Procedure"" reads thus:Vera Aranha vs Jacob Harlad Aranha on 26 June, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1642927/ 1""Subject to the provisions herein contained, all proceedings under this Act between party and party shall be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure."" 5. The relevant part of S. 55, the languageof which we are called upon to construe reads as under : ""All decrees and orders made by the Court in any suit or proceeding under this Act...... may be appealed from in the like manner as the decrees and orders of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction ............ may be appealed from under the laws rules and orders for the time being in force."" 6. Section 28, Hindu Marriage Act, as it stood in 1960, has employed identical words. It reads:-- ""All decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceedings under this Act shall be enforced in like manner as the decree orders of the Court made in the exerted of its original civil jurisdiction are enforced and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force: Provided that there shall be no appeal on the subject of costs only."" 7. The judgements that have been cited before us, with the exception of A. v.B (1898) ILR 22 Bom. 612, are under the Hindu Marriage Act, written with reference to S. 28 of the Act. 8. According to the appellant, S. 55 of the Act creates a substantive right of appeal, not only against all the decrees, but ""all orders"". The words ""under the laws, rules and orders for the time being in force', which occur at the end of the first part of that section do not curtail the right of appeal, but merely prescribe the procedure, such as institution of and the forum for appeals. Thus, all orders are appealable, even if they are interim orders irrespective of the provisions of other laws, rules and orders which may be in force. According to the respeondent, ""the laws, rules and orders for the time being in force"" refer, in the context of this case, to the Code of Civil Procedure. They quality the right of appeal. Therefore, if the order is not appealable under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, no appeal against such an order lies, S. 55 of the Act notwithstanding. 9. Before referring to the judgements cited before us, certain consequences of the construction advocated before us by Mr. Arbanha, who appears in person, may be borne in mind. The argument is that though ""all"" orders are appealable under the first part of s. 55, in order that such order is appealable, O. LXIII and S. 104, Civil P.C. must also make the order appealable. In other words, the right of appeal under S. 55 may be curtailed by the provisions of any other law which may be in force. Secondly, though the right of appeal is apparently unqualified and unlimited, it depends upon what the Code of Civil Procedure enacts. The argument of the respondent, if accepted, would mean that what is created by S. 55, can be limited by another law. In other words, by our construction we are asked to limit or curtail the right of appeal granted by s. 55. 10. Section 28, Hindu Marriage Act, as it stood in 1960, also provides that ""all decrees and orders"" may be appealed from ""under any law for the time being in force"". Prithvirajsinghji v. Bai Shiva Prabhakumari, AIR 1960 Bom 315 lays down tow propositions:Vera Aranha vs Jacob Harlad Aranha on 26 June, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1642927/ 2Firstly, the words ""any law for the time being in force"" occurring in S. 28, refer to the laws such as the Code of Civil Procedure and that such laws determine the appealability of the such laws determine the appealability of the orders made under the Hindu Marriage Act; Secondly, S. 104 and O. LXIII, R. 1 Civil P.C., which set out orders appealable under the Code of Civil Procedure, do not list the orders of alimony pendent lite made under the Hindu marriage Act. Therefore, order of interim alimony made under S. 24, Hindu Marriage Act is not appealable. 11. As against this, in three decisions of the Gujarat High Court, lallubhai v. Nirmalaben, , Harilal Purshottam v. Lilavati Gokaldas, and bai Umiyabhen v. Ambalal Laxmidas, a contrary view has been taken. 12. The law laid down by Gujarat High Court may be sumarised as under :-- Section 28, Hindu Marriage Act, does not intend to create right of appeal against decrees and orders passed under that Act by reference to what is enacted by the Coe of Civil Procedure. There is no provision in the jcode of Civil Procedure or in any other law under which any appeal could be filed from orders made under the Hindu Marriage Act. Harilal Purshaottam v. Lilavati Gokaldas, . Lallubhai v. Nirmalaben, . 13. A right of appeal against ""all decrees and order"" is created by jS. 28, Hindu Marriage Act. Harilal Purshottam v. Lilavati Gokalas . Lallubhai v. Nirmalaben, . (c) The words ""under any law for the time being in force"" employed in S. 28, are intended to provide procedure for and the forum of such appeals and do not determine appealability of the orders. Harilal Purshottam v. Lilavati Gokaldas, , Bai Umiyabhen v. Ambalal Laxmidas, . 14. Two more decisions are of importance they are D. S. Seshadri v. Jayalakshmi, and Kode Kutumbha Rao v. Kode Sesharathnamamba, . The madras High Court, as also the Andhra Pradesh High Court laid down that the right of appeal created by S. 28, Hindu Marriage Act cannot be subject to limitation that such a right should be shown to have existed under some other law, such as Code of Civil Procedure. The held that the word ""any law for the time being in force"" regulate the forum and procedure and do not restrict the right of appeal created by the Hindu Marriage Act. A similar view was taken in Sushila Devi v. Dhani Ram, and Smt. Snehlkata Dansena v.l Jagdish Dansena, . 15. We now proceed to consider the question referred to us. 16. Under S. 55 ""all"" decree and orders may be ""appealed from"". Since ""all"" orders may be ""appealed from"" under S. 55, the question is whether the words ""all......... orders"" mean every order or such order as may be appealed from under the provisions of the Code of Civil Porcedure, If the decision ofVera Aranha vs Jacob Harlad Aranha on 26 June, 1987 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1642927/ 3",['28']
353,"Madras High Court S. Rangaraj vs R.R. Subbayan And Ors. on 22 January, 1990 Equivalent citations: II (1990) DMC 277 Author: N Sundaram Bench: N Sundaram, Bellie JUDGMENT Nainar Sundaram, J. 1. This first Appeal is by the first defendant in O.S. No. 267 of 1975 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Coimbatore. The respondents herein areas follows : The first-respondent is the first-plaintiff; the second-respondent is the second-plaintiff; the third-respondent is the third-defendant and the fourth-respondent is the fourth-defendant. Defendants 2 and 5 in the suit have been given up in the Appeal. The parties shall be referred to by us as per their array in the suit for the sake of convenience. The plaintiffs laid the suit for partition and separate possession, each of the plaintiffs claiming a one-third share and they conceded the remaining one-third share for the first-defendant. The relationship amongst the parties is as follows : The first-plaintiff earlier married the fifth-defendant, she was divorced by a decree of divorce on 23-6-1961 in O.P. No. 54 of 1961 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Coimbatore. During the subsistence of the marriage between the first-plaintiff and the fifth-defendant, the children born to them are the first-defendant, the son and the second-defendant, the daughter. The first-plaintiff married the fourth-defendant after the decree for divorce with regard to his marriage with the fifth-defendant. The children born out of the wedlock between the first-plaintiff and the fourth-defendant are the second-plaintiff, the son and the third-defendant, the daughter. 2. In our view, the real controversy in the suit centers around three moot questions and, in fact, they were the questions argued by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, and they are : (i) Whether the marriage of the first-plaintiff with the fourth-defendant was invalid on account of the fact that it came to be solemnised before the lapse of one year after the decree for divorce was obtained with regard to the marriage of the first-plaintiff with the fifth-defendant and consequently the second-plaintiff could not claim the status of a legitimate son of the first-plaintiff and on that basis ask for an independent share in the entirety of the joint family properties; (ii) Whether on account of the registration of the marriage between the first-plaintiff and the fourth-defendant under the Special Marriage Act 43 of 1954, hereinafter referred to as the Act 43 of 1954, there was a severance in status, as contemplated under Section 19 of Act 43 of 1954 and hence the second-plaintiff could not claim an independent one-third share in the entirety of the joint family properties and he could claim only a share in the share of his father-the first plaintiff in the entirety of the joint family properties, on the basis of their relationship; (iii) Whether the properties other than the properties set out in Schedule 'B' to the plaint; claimed by the first-plaintiff as his self-acquisitions, are joint family properties available for division ? 3. The Court below, however, as per the pleadings, put forth by the parties, initially framed eleven issues and they have been supplemented by two more issues as follows :S. Rangaraj vs R.R. Subbayan And Ors. on 22 January, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1457707/ 1""1. Whether the plaintiffs 1 and 2 are not entitled to 1/3rd share each in the plaint properties ? 2. Whether the marriage of the plaintiff with Srimathi Soundari is void ? 3. Whether the 2nd plaintiff is not the legitimate son of the plaintiff ? 4. Whether the plaintiff married his second wife under the Special Marriage Act ? 5. Whether there was any severence in status by operation of law? 6. Whether the first-plaintiff is liable to account for the income ? 7. Whether the first-plaintiff blended his professional income from the family lands ? 8. Whether there are other joint family properties except those set out in the plaint ? 9. Whether the suit is bad as one for partial partition ? 10. Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of parties ? 11. To what relief ? Additional Issue framed on 24-8-1978 : What is the provision to be made for third defendant for her maintenance, marriage expenses and educational expenses ? Additional Issue framed on 23-11-1978 : What is the provision to be made for the 4th defendant for her maintenance ?"" 4. The parties placed their evidence, oral and documentary, and that was the subject matter of consideration by the Court below and on Issue Number 2, the Court below held that the marriage between the first-plaintiff and the fourth defendant having come to be performed before the lapse of the prohibited period of one year after the grant of the decree for divorce between the first-plaintiff and the fifth-defendant, is not a valid one. On Issue Numbers 4 and 5, the Court below held that the marriage between the first-plaintiff and the fourth-defendant took place only according to the Hindu rites and caste customs and the registration of the said marriage under Act 43 of 1954 was only for record purposes and hence there was no severence in status by operation of law as per Section 19 of Act 43 of 1954. On Issue Number 3, the Court below held that the second plaintiff is not the legitimate son of the first-plaintiff. On Issue Numbers 7 and 8, the Court below held that there are no properties other than those set out in the plaint that could be given a character of joint family properties, since there was no blending, as alleged by the first-defendant. As a result, on Issue Number 9, the Court below held that the suit is not bad for partial partition. Taking up Issue No. 10,S. Rangaraj vs R.R. Subbayan And Ors. on 22 January, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1457707/ 2the Court below found that the lacuna of non-joinder got rectified, subsequent to the filing of the written-statement of the first-defendant by the plaintiffs, adding on the proper parties. On Issue Number 1, the Court below held that because there was no severance in status by operation of law and by virtue of Section 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the second-plaintiff would also be entitled to a one-third share in the entirety of the estate. On Issue Number 6, the Court below found that there was no income to be accounted for by the first-plaintiff. With regard to additional issue relating to the provision for the fourth-defendant, that was disposed of in accordance with the compromise between the parties. With regard to the additional issue relating to the provision for the third-defendant, taking note of the admission by the plaintiffs themselves in their reply statement, such a provision was given to the third-defendant. As a result, the Court below granted decree as follows : ""In the result, the suit is decreed for partition of the plaint B Schedule properties into three equal shares and to allot one such share each to the plaintiffs 1 and 2. Out of one-third share which is to be allotted to the first plaintiff, 40 cents extent of properties has to be set apart to the fourth defendant in lieu of her maintenance in full quit. The provisions to be made for the third defendant for her maintenance, marriage expenses and educational expenses have to be taken into consideration at the time of passing final decree. In the circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to bear their respective costs."" 5. Here before us, the first question that was concentrated upon by Mr. C. Chinnaswami, learned counsel for the first defendant is that the court below having found that the marriage between the first plaintiff and the fourth defendant is invalid on account of the same taking place before the lapse of the prohibited period of one year from the date of the decree of divorce between the first plaintiff and the fifth defendant and further having found that the second plaintiff could not claim the status of a legitimate son of the first plaintiff, ought not to have granted the second/ plaintiff a one-third share in the entirety of the joint family properties. Learned counsel for the first-defendant would contend that the second-plaintiff, if at all could claim only a share in the share of the first-plaintiff in the entirety of the joint family properties on the basis of their relationship. The factual position that has emerged from the evidence in the case is that the ceremony of marriage as per the Hindu rites and caste customs was gone through between the first-plaintiff and the fourth-defendant even before the lapse of the prohibited period of one, year. Though Mr. E. Padmanabhan, learned counsel for the plaintiffs, made an attempt to impeach this finding of the Court below, he could not succeed in his endeavours. However, learned counsel for the plaintiffs, banked more on the legal impact and implications that have come into play by virtue of the amendments introduced into the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 68 of 1976, hereinafter referred to as Act 68 of 1976. Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 before its amendment by Act 68 of 1976 stood as follows : ""When a marriage has been dissolved by decree of divorce and either there is no right of appeal against the decree, or if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again :S.

This first appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 26.08.2011 passed by the Judge, Family Court No.3, Nagpur in petition No.A-263/2007 thereby passing the order of dissolution of the marriage between the parties on the ground of cruelty. FCA 166/14 2 Judgment 2. The appellant-Wife and the respondent-Husband, both, are Doctors by profession. (hereinafter the appellant-wife and the respondent-husband are referred to as per their marital status, i.e. Wife and Husband, for the sake of brevity and convenience). Their marriage was settled on 18.06.2006. It was an arranged marriage. On 16.12.2006, the marriage was solemnized and both went to Ooty for their honeymoon thereby the marriage was consummated. However, there were few clashes at Ooty between the parties and after their return, the Wife went to her maiden home at Parbhani in the month of January-2007. The Husband and his family members found abnormal traits in the behaviour of the Wife. There was an apprehension that she would commit suicide anytime and, thereafter, he went to Parbhani in the third week of January-2007 along with his family members and friends. The Wife gave a written undertaking that she would behave properly and would not do any eccentric act. Her parents' family friends also signed on that undertaking dated 21.01.2007 and, thereafter, she came and started residing with the Husband and his family members. The father of the Husband is a reputed doctor from Nagpur and the family is well off. In February-2007, the behaviour of the Wife was not normal FCA 166/14 3 Judgment and in the second week of March-2007, she tried to commit suicide and, therefore, the Husband lodged a report with the police and she was sent to her maiden home. When she tried to come back in the month of March-2007, she was not allowed by the Husband and his father and since then, the Wife has been staying with her parents at Parbhani. The Husband filed a petition for nullity of marriage under Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on 24.04.2007 on the ground of fraud that if he would have been aware of suicidal traits in the wife, he would not have married her. In the same petition, he alternatively prayed for grant of a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. 3. The Wife after service of summons appeared before the Family Court, Nagpur. She denied all the allegations and the contentions raised in the petition and she countered that the family of the Husband had demanded dowry from her father and her father had paid dowry of Rs.1,25,000/- (Rupees One Lac Twenty Five Thousand only) at the time of marriage. Moreover, at the time of honeymoon at Ooty, as all the money was exhausted, the Husband asked her to take out an amount of Rs.3,000/- (Rupees Three FCA 166/14 4 Judgment Thousand only) from her account through A.T.M. and at that time, as she was late due to the rush, however, he shouted at her.

Both the parties entered the witness box and were subjected to cross-examination. The Husband examined his father Vitthalrao Punjaji Dandge and one Ramchandra Namdeorao Patne, who was a family friend and who went to Parbhani along with the Husband. 5. The Wife examined Satish Sambhajirao Wankhedkar, her maternal uncle, on the point of treatment given by the family members of the husband to her and the father of the wife. She also examined one Padmakar Parshuram Babre as a signatory to Exhibit 37, the Vachanpatra, dated 21.01.2007 that she was not willing to sign the undertaking but, she signed under pressure. FCA 166/14 5 Judgment 6. Considering the evidence, the learned Judge, Family Court, though rejected the case of the husband on the ground of nullity of marriage, granted relief of dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. Hence, this appeal. 7. Shri Bhide, the learned counsel for the Wife, has submitted that the learned Judge, Family Court has committed an error in granting the divorce on the ground of cruelty. He raised a legal point of the competency of the learned Judge, Family Court of entertaining the said marriage petition under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The marriage was solemnized on 16.12.2006 and the petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty was filed on 24.04.2007, i.e. within one year from the date of the marriage. Under Section 14, the petition for divorce is required to be presented after one year and, therefore, the learned Judge, Family Court was not competent to entertain such petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce. He further submitted that a petition for divorce can be entertained, if filed within one year of the marriage under the proviso to Section 14 subject to a separate application made by the party in accordance with the rules made by FCA 166/14 6 Judgment the High Court making out a case of exceptional hardship. In support of his submissions, he relied on the rules made under notification of the Bombay High Court, dated 12.11.1955. He relied especially on rule 10 thereof, wherein an application for leave under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act is necessary if the petition for divorce is presented within one year of marriage. He submitted that the petition is filed in deviation of these rules and the mandatory provisions in the section and, therefore, it was not maintainable. In support of his submissions, he relied on the case decided by the Division Bench of Karnataka High Court in Smt.Jacintha Kamath Versus K.Padmanabha Kamath, reported in AIR 1992 Karnataka 372 and also on the judgment of Karnataka High Court in Sharma M. Kashinath Versus Shobha, reported in I (2011) DMC 457 (DB). 8. The learned counsel for the Wife on merits has submitted that the learned Judge, Family Court has rightly dismissed the petition on the ground of nullity of the marriage, however, gave erroneous finding on the point of cruelty. He submitted that after the settlement of the marriage in June-2006, the Husband met with an accident in August-2006 and at that time, the Wife went from FCA 166/14Dr. Rajasi @ Swapna W/O Shashank ... vs Dr. Shashank S/O Vitthalrao ... on 6 January, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168346092/ 3","['12', '14']"

Whether the judgment should be reported          Yes      in the Digest? KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. * 1. By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the appellant seeks to challenge the impugned judgment and decree dated 24.10.2000, whereby the learned trial court has passed a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion under Section 13 (1) (ia) and 13 (1) (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The main grounds to assail the findings of the learned trial court taken in the present appeal inter alia are that the appellant was turned out of her matrimonial home in three wearings after she was mercilessly beaten by the respondent husband and this aspect was completely ignored by the learned trial court; the learned trial court also misread the evidence and assumed certain evidence which in fact does not exist; the allegations leveled by the petitioner husband in the divorce petition are contrary to the stand taken by him in his petition filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act; the respondent husband had started creating evidence in his favour after a complaint was filed by the father of the appellant against him with the concerned police station; the learned trial court wrongly placed reliance on the FIR and the MLC, which documents could not be proved by the respondent in accordance with law; no specific allegations ofRenu Bala vs Jagdeep Chiller on 18 August, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70794185/ 1cruelty were leveled by the respondent against the appellant till the date she remained in the matrimonial home; the plea of the respondent that he was given assurance by the appellant that she would come and join the matrimonial home is palpably false as the appellant had appeared before the concerned court to contest the petition filed by the respondent under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act while the respondent chose not to appear on two dates which ultimately led to the dismissal of the said petition; the appellant never refused to join the company of the respondent and therefore the respondent miserably failed to prove one of the essential ingredients, „animus deserendi to prove the ground of desertion; the appellant on the other hand successfully proved that she left the matrimonial home due to merciless beatings given by the respondent husband, therefore by granting a decree of divorce in favour of the respondent, the learned trial court has given advantage to the respondent husband to take benefit of his own wrongs. Broadly on the abovementioned grounds the appellant seeks to impugn the said judgment and decree. 2. Mr. Sanjeev Sindhwani, counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondent has failed to prove either the ground of cruelty or desertion on the part of the appellant. So far the ground of desertion is concerned, the counsel contended that the respondent failed to establish or prove on record that the appellant intended to permanently bring to an end the cohabitation between the parties and hence the respondent has failed to prove the essential ingredient of animus deserendi. Counsel also submitted that it is the respondent who forced the appellant to leave the matrimonial home on 15.09.1991 after being severely beaten by him. Counsel further urged that by filing a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking restoration of Conjugal Rights, the respondent has not only condoned the alleged acts of cruelty on the part of the appellant but in fact has also condoned the alleged act of desertion on her part. In support of his argument, counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of the Himachal Pradesh High Court in the case of Nirmala Devi Vs. Ved Prakash AIR 1993 HP 1 with special emphasis on paras 5, 8, 10, 11 & 13. Counsel also invited attention of this Court to Section 23 sub section (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act to support his argument that under sub section (b) of Section 23 (1) wherein reference has been made to clause (1) of Section 13, the same does not merely refer to 13 (1) (ia) but also to (ib) of Section 13(1) and therefore the condonation aspect is to be considered not only vis-à-vis ground of cruelty but for desertion as well. 3. Mr. Sindhwani further submitted that merely registration of an FIR against the brother and father of the appellant cannot be taken as an admission of the alleged acts attributed to them so far the appellant is concerned. Counsel also submitted that the findings of the criminal court would not bind the civil court. Counsel also submitted that nowhere either in the pleadings or in the evidence it was proved that the alleged beatings by the brother and family members of the appellant were at the behest of the appellant and in para 59 & 60 of the impugned judgment the trial court has wrongly observed that the said traumatic events were suffered by the husband at the hands of the wife and her family members who had acted at the behest of the appellant. The contention of the counsel was that these cruel acts, so far as the appellant is concerned, are not attributable to her but against the brother of the appellant and his friends who have been alleged to have kidnapped and beaten the respondent. Counsel further argued that merely because in the cross- examination of the PW 1 theRenu Bala vs Jagdeep Chiller on 18 August, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70794185/ 2amount of dowry as demanded was not correctly suggested, that by itself could not belie raising of the demand by the respondent. The contention of the counsel was that the appellant in her examination-in-chief clearly deposed that a demand of Rs.50,000/- was raised by the respondent and she was told that she would be permitted to live in the matrimonial home only if her father paid the said amount to him. The said deposition of the appellant was strictly as per the case set up by her in her pleadings and therefore even if in the cross-examination of the respondent, due to some inadvertence, wrong figure of Rs.1,00,000/- was suggested to him, the same cannot be construed to mean that no demand was raised by the respondent. Finding another illegality in the impugned judgment, the counsel submitted that the Ld. Trial Court gave undue weightage to the different date given by the RW2, father of the appellant in his evidence of her leaving the matrimonial house, although the appellant herself was consistent in disclosing only one date i.e. 15.09.1991 of leaving the matrimonial home. 4. Assailing the findings of the trial court on cruelty, Mr. Sindhwani submitted that the allegations of cruelty leveled by the respondent husband are vague and general in nature and the same are not in conformity with the rules framed by the High Court under the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. Counsel also submitted that in para 37 of the impugned judgment, the learned trial court has wrongly attributed certain statement coming from the deposition of PW-1 while in fact no such statement was made by PW-1 in his entire deposition. He referred to para 15 of the impugned judgment to submit that nowhere in the evidence it was proved on record that the new residence was set up by the respondent husband to pacify the appellant wife. The contention of the counsel for the appellant was that there is an uncorroborated statement of the respondent husband on one hand and of the appellant on the other hand, but without disclosing any valid reason, the learned trial court has believed the version of the respondent husband and not that of the appellant wife. Counsel also submitted that no case of abduction was made out on record and therefore the learned trial court has made wrong observation in para 51 of the judgment that abduction of master Rajat from the custody of the husband caused mental agony to him. The contention of the counsel was that master Rajat was about 11 months old on the date of the alleged abduction i.e. 01.11.1991, and admittedly, the appellant wife was not living with the respondent husband, therefore, clearly as per the respondent husband 11 months old child was alone at the house which is highly improbable. Counsel further submitted that the respondent husband stated that he was informed by a neighbour about the said fact of abduction of the child but no such neighbour was produced in the witness box. Counsel thus submitted that this theory of abduction has been coined by the respondent to attribute cruelty on the part of the appellant wife. Counsel also submitted that even otherwise it was a hearsay version and the same cannot be admissible in evidence. 6. Mr. Sindhwani further submitted that the trial court wrongly observed in para 52 of the impugned judgment, that the FIR and MLC were proved on record. The contention of the counsel was that neither the FIR nor the MLC were proved by the respondent as neither any witness from the police was produced to prove the FIR nor the concerned Doctor was produced to prove the MLC. Counsel further submitted that the court below gave further incorrect finding that these documents were not disputed by the appellant. Referring to para 52 of the judgment, counsel submitted that again the court made certain observations without the backing of the evidence on record as the appellant wasRenu Bala vs Jagdeep Chiller on 18 August, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70794185/ 3","['9', '28', '13', '23']"

Sunder Raj, husband of the respondent P. Sarika Raj, against the judgment and decree dated 07.06.2012 passed by the learned District Judge Family Court, Gurgaon whereby the petition of the respondent-wife seeking cancellation of the judgment and decree dated 05.01.2009 passed by the learned Family Court, Hyderabad in OP No.1083 of 2008 has been allowed. The marriage between the parties was solemnized at Gurgaon on 30.10.2002. The marriage was an outcome of an affair that the parties had. From the marriage the parties had a son namely Vishwajit Raj, who was born on 21.08.2006 and a daughter namely Lakshita Raj, who was born on 22.11.2007. After marriage, the parties stayed at Hyderabad. On account of matrimonial dispute between them, the respondent-wife filed OP No.1083 of 2008 on 05.01.2009 in the Court of the learned Judge, Family Court at Hyderabad seeking dissolution of the marriage AMIT KHANCHI 2015.03.18 15:45 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document High Court,Chandigarh between the parties on the grounds of cruelty. It was alleged that the dispute between the parties arose mainly from the rites, customs and habits that were followed. The appellant-husband and his parents, it was alleged, were treating the respondent-wife in a cruel manner for not following their customs. Therefore, it was prayed that a decree of divorce may be granted. In the petition filed before the Family Court at Hyderabad, a memorandum of compromise stated to have been reached at on 04.01.2009 was filed. It was submitted that the said OP had been filed by the respondent-wife seeking a decree for dissolution of marriage between the parties. The relatives and elders of both the parties advised them to settle the matter amicably. As such both the parties decided to terminate the marital relationship between them. There was no chance of reconciliationP. Sunder Raj vs P. Sarkia Raj on 2 March, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160035182/ 1between them; besides, there were serious differences between them which could not be compromised as both were not interested in marital life. Therefore, both of them realized that it was no longer possible for them to live together as husband and wife. In the said circumstances, the parties decided to move for consent divorce to avoid further legal proceedings. It was agreed that the custody of the two children shall be given to the appellant-husband. The respondent-wife was entitled to visitation rights at a convenient time and that the appellant would have no objection for the same. The respondent-wife it was recorded was doing a job and she had the capacity to maintain herself. Therefore, she was not claiming any permanent alimony or monthly maintenance from the appellant AMIT KHANCHI 2015.03.18 15:45 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document High Court,Chandigarh or from the property or annual earnings or financial sources. The respondent-wife decided to leave her two children with the appellant-husband who was the natural guardian and decided not to claim her children in future. There was no collusion between the parties in filing the joint memo in the OP for consent decree for divorce. It was submitted that the above terms and conditions were accepted before elders and relatives of both the parties. Therefore, there was no collusion between them in entering into the memorandum of compromise, which was filed in the Court of the learned Judge, Family Court, Hyderabad. The learned Judge, Family Court, Hyderabad changed the memo of parties from that of ""P. Sunder Raj vs. P. Sarika Raj' to that of ""P. Sarika Raj and P.Sunder Raj""; besides, in the head note of the petition, in the order that was passed as also in the decree-sheet it is mentioned; ""Petition filed under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to dissolve the marriage between petitioner No.1 and petitioner No.2 performed on 14.08.2005 by mutual consent."" In the order that was passed on 05.01.2009, it is mentioned that the petition was filed under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act by P. Sarika Raj against her husband P. Sunder Raj for divorce. It is further mentioned that both the petitioner and respondent were present and represented; that due to the intervention of their well-wishers and elders, they had settled their dispute amicably and requested to record the terms of compromise which was submitted to the Court along with the petition under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure ('CPC' AMIT KHANCHI 2015.03.18 15:45 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document High Court,Chandigarh - for short). Upon hearing the parties in person with their respective counsel, the petition under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC was allowed. The terms of the compromise and the passing of the order for dissolving the marriage are mentioned. A decree-sheet was also drawn up on 05.01.2009 on the basis that the petition had been filed under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act. After the decree had been passed, OS No.468 of 2009 was filed by the respondent-wife in the Court of learned Family Judge, Hyderabad under Section 31 (1) and (2) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 on 24.07.2009. Cancellation of the order and decree dated 05.01.2009 passed in OP No.1083 of 2008 was sought. It was alleged that the respondent-wife was made to sign the relevant papers by the appellant-husband under threat, coercion, fear of death, fraud and undue influence etc. and that the same were signed without even reading those papers and without her consent. The appellant-husband filed written statement to the plaint filed by the plaintiff (respondent-wife) seeking cancellation of the decree. The respondent-wife then filed Transfer Petition (C) Nos.908-911 of 2009 in the Hon'ble Supreme Court under Section 31 CPC seeking transfer of OS No.468 of 2009P. Sunder Raj vs P. Sarkia Raj on 2 March, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/160035182/ 2filed by her under Section 31 (1) and (2) of the Specific Relief Act and other connected miscellaneous applications from the Family Court at Hyderabad to the Family Court at Gurgaon. The transfer application of the respondent-wife was allowed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 14.12.2009 and OS No.468 of 2009, OP No.103 of 2008 and connected miscellaneous applications were transferred from the AMIT KHANCHI 2015.03.18 15:45 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document High Court,Chandigarh Family Court at Hyderabad to the District Judge, Gurgaon. The case was then transferred to the District Judge, Family Court at Gurgaon. The District Judge, Family Court, Gurgaon vide impugned judgment and decree dated 07.06.2012 accepted the petition of the respondent-wife and cancelled the judgment and decree dated 05.01.2009 passed in OP No.1083 of 2008 by the learned Family Court at Hyderabad. The appellant aggrieved against the same has filed the present appeal. Mr. J. D. Bhattacharaya, Advocate learned counsel appearing for the appellant has contended that the respondent-wife after having validly entered into a compromise and signed the memorandum of compromise, on the basis of which the judgment and decree dated 05.01.2009 was passed by the learned Family Court at Hyderabad in OP No.1083 of 2008, had no right to resile or back out from the same and seek its cancellation. In any case it is submitted that the petition for cancellation of the decree dated 05.01.2009 was not maintainable before the Family Court and only the appropriate Court which may be the Civil Court had the jurisdiction to entertain and try such a petition. It is submitted that the fact that the Family Court allowed the divorce petition vide impugned judgment and decree dated 05.01.2009 without waiting for the period of six months would not invalidate the said impugned judgment and decree dated 05.01.2009 and at the most it would be only an irregular decree, which can only be set aside in accordance with law i.e. by way of a civil suit in the Civil Court or an appeal and not by a suit or a petition under Section 31 (1) and (2) of the AMIT KHANCHI 2015.03.18 15:45 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document High Court,Chandigarh Specific Relief Act, before the Family Court. Insofar as the waiting period of six months is concerned, learned counsel for the appellant has laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the Family Court can evolve its own procedure for deciding the disputes for settlement in terms of Section 10 (3) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 ('1984 Act' - for short). Therefore, it is submitted that the learned District Judge, Family Court gravely erred in law and facts in entertaining the suit and in fact it had no jurisdiction to do so as it does not have the trappings of a Court to invalidate a decree of the Family Court. In response, Mr. Sunder Singh, Advocate learned counsel appearing for the respondent has contended that the judgment and decree dated 07.06.2012 passed by the learned Family Court at Gurgaon is perfectly valid and legal. It is submitted that in the heading and prayer of the petition that was filed under Section 25 CPC in the Supreme Court, it was mentioned for transfer of the case from Family Court, Hyderabad to the Family Court, Gurgaon. However, no objection was raised by the appellant regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Family Court either at Hyderabad or at Gurgaon before the Supreme Court nor was any such objection recorded by the Supreme Court in its order while transferring the petition. Even in the written statement filed by the appellant before the learned Family Court, Gurgaon, it is submitted that no objection regarding lack of jurisdiction was raised.

This Appeal is filed by the Appellant - husband an Ophthalmologist (hereafter referred as ""Petitioner""), whose Petition for divorce against the Respondent - wife B.H.M.S. - practicing fca13.08 Homeopathy (hereafter referred as ""Respondent"") has been dismissed by the Family Court, Aurangabad in Petition No.A.263 of 2006. Keeping in view the nature of dispute, we have blocked the names of the parties in the cause title. 2. Succinctly put, the marriage between the parties took place on 29th November 2002. They lived together happily for some time and then due to disputes, the Petitioner claims that the Respondent deserted him on 30th December 2003. The Respondent claims that she was beaten and left at the place of her parents on 4th December 2003. Petitioner - husband earlier filed Divorce Petition No.A.46 of 2004 on 3rd February 2004. The Respondent received summons in that matter on 9th February 2004. Thereafter few incidents took place and the Respondent filed F.I.R. leading to criminal case against the Petitioner and his other family members. The Petitioner withdrew earlier divorce Petition due to further developments. The fca13.08 present Petition No.A.263 of 2006 came to be filed later on, on 27th September 2006, which has now been dismissed by the Family Court on 27th March 2008. 3. To understand the disputes between the parties, it is now necessary to refer the facts in some more details. EARLIER PETITION NO.A.46 OF 2004 . Exhibit 52 is copy of the earlier Petition No.A.46 of 2004. It was divorce Petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Petitioner claims that his marriage with Respondent could be termed as self arranged marriage. Engagement took place on 27th October 2002. The engagement was broken by the parents of the Respondent on the ground that she was not offered proper gifts and number of fca13.08 persons who attended the function were more. As Respondent and her paternal uncle were ready for marriage, registered marriage was performed and religious rites were carried out at Ghrishneshwar Temple, Ellora (on 29th November 2002). Reception took place on 8th December 2002, in which only uncle and aunt of Respondent attended. In the evening, on the day of marriage, the parents and relatives of Respondent had come to the residence of the Petitioner and quarreled. The marriage was happy for few days. Later on Respondent was not behaving properly and insulted the Petitioner in front of his parents and friends. She used to take suspicion against the Petitioner if any time he talked with any girl. She suspected him with his cousin sister also and he was lowered in the eyes of relatives and sister. When a female friend called from Bombay, Respondent quarreled with the fca13.08 Petitioner and left the house alleging that Petitioner had relations with that friend. She was back answering elderly persons and mother of Petitioner. The Respondent was being instigated by her parents. She had the habit of disclosing private life to friends and creatingAjay Devidasrao Sambare vs Vaishali Ajay Sambare on 21 January, 2016 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18424518/ 2embarrassment. She left house on many occasions and the Petitioner brought her back. She did not behave properly with friends and relatives and avoided to perform religious ceremonies. She had the habit of leaving the gold ornaments open on bed and when pointed out, she quarreled. She quarreled and deserted the Petitioner claiming that she will put him behind the bars. She threatened to commit suicide. She consistently humiliated him which acts amounted to cruelty. It had become impossible to live with her due to mental agony and torture. fca13.08 . With such facts the first Petition claimed divorce. WITHDRAWAL OF EARLIER PETITION: 4. The Petitioner filed application (Exhibit 58) in the earlier Petition claiming that the Respondent has now filed criminal complaint and he wanted to withdraw the Petition to file fresh divorce Petition after dismissal of the criminal case and so with permission, liberty may be given. The Respondent took time to reply but did not file reply and then the Judge of the Family Court, without recording grant of permission, passed order dismissing the Petition for want of prosecution. Against the withdrawal, Respondent filed Family Court Appeal No.47 of 2004 (Exhibit 59) in this Court and the Appeal was dismissed with clarification that no adverse order has been passed against the present Respondent, as no leave fca13.08 had been granted. PRESENT PETITION NO.A.263 OF 2006 5. Subsequently the present divorce Petition No.A.263 of 2006 was filed. In this Petition the first twelve paragraphs are similar to the averments as made in the earlier Petition, to which we have made brief reference above. From Paragraph No. 13 onwards, there is reference to other facts which took place after filing of the earlier Petition. We proceed to refer to those facts in brief, as pleaded by the Petitioner. . The Petitioner has now further claimed that after the earlier Petition was filed, notice was issued to Respondent and it was served on her. Thereafter she came to the Petitioner and gave threats that she will file false criminal case under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C.) against him and his family members. On 25th fca13.08 February 2004 when Petitioner was going on motorcycle from Kranti Chowk towards Paithan Gate, at about 2.00 p.m., in Nutan Colony, the Respondent stopped him and gave such threats. She also threatened that she will commit suicide and implicate him and his family members and put them in jail. On 26th February 2004 she came to the clinic of the Petitioner and in front of patients abused and threatened him. In view of such acts of Respondent, the Petitioner filed application with Kranti Chowk Police Station on 27th February 2004. On 28th February 2004 Respondent came in front of his clinic and asked him to withdraw the divorce Petition or else she would file case under Section 498-A of I.P.C. The Petitioner informed this to Mukundwadi Police Station vide N.C.

This is an appeal filed under Section 28 read with Article 227 of the Constitution of India by the appellant against the order dated 16.3.2009 by virtue of which the application of the appellant for dismissal of the petition for divorce filed by the respondent herein under Section 13 (i) (a) of the Hindu Marriage Act was sought to be dismissed on the ground that the marriage between the parties had been contracted under the Special Marriage Act, therefore, the petition for divorce ought to have been filed under the Special Marriage Act. 2. The question which is arising for consideration is as to whether the court can reject an application for dismissal of the divorce petition which has been filed under the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of cruelty and desertion when admittedly the parties have contracted a marriage under the Special Marriage Act and yet give a direction suo motu to the respondent to amend the petition. 3. Both Mr. Chandhiok, the learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Jai Bansal, the learned counsel for the respondent have vehemently canvassed for their point of view with number of judgments but before dealing with their respective submissions, it may be pertinent here to given a brief background of the case. 4. The respondent/petitioner filed a petition against the appellant/wife for grant of divorce under Section 13 (i) (a) and (i) (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the grounds of cruelty and desertion. It was not disputed that the parties are Hindu by religion and got married on 29.10.1986 as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. The marriage though a love marriage could not continue for very long and the relationship soured as a consequence of which the marriage got dissolved by a decree of divorce onSuman Kundra vs Sanjeev Kundra on 28 May, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177304220/ 12.6.1988. 5. After the decree of divorce having been passed, the parties were drawn against each other once again and they decided to get re-married for second time. This time on 3.5.1990, the marriage was solemnized before a Marriage Officer, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi under the Special Marriages Act. The parties could not reconcile their inherent differences and the husband on 21.07.2005 filed a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion under Section 13 (i) (a) and (i) (b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 6. The appellant contested the petition and filed her written statement on 8.9.2005. Issues were framed on 27.9.2008 and the case was set down for trial. The respondent/petitioner filed his affidavit of evidence on 28.11.2008 and 7.1.2009 and the case was adjourned to 11.2.2009. 7. On 9.2.2009, the appellant/defendant filed an application under Section 151 CPC seeking dismissal of the petition on the ground that a false averment has been made in the petition with regard to the status of the respondent/petitioner and further that the divorce petition has been filed under HMA while as admittedly the marriage has taken place under Special Marriage Act. Therefore, the petition on the face of it was not maintainable. 8. The respondent/petitioner filed his reply to the application and stated that the petition for divorce cannot be dismissed on account of the error which has crept in the petition with regard to the mentioning of the provision for grant of divorce which admittedly was cruelty and the said ground of cruelty apart from being a ground under Section 13 (1) (a) of the HMA is also a ground for grant of divorce under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act. It was also contended that the learned ADJ who is to try the divorce petition under the HMA is also to try the divorce petition under the Special Marriage Act and therefore, this being only a technical objection should not come in the way of processing and dealing with the petition on merits. 9. The learned ADJ after hearing the arguments of both the sides dismissed the application of the appellant by holding that he has the jurisdiction to entertain the petition for divorce both under the HMA as well as Special Marriage Act and the cruelty being a ground for divorce under both the Acts, therefore, the petition could continue as there is a cause of action for the same. However, while dismissing the application, the learned Judge distinguished the judgment relied upon by the appellant in Harshad Chiman Lal Modi vs. DLF Universal & Anr.; (2005) 7 SCC 791, which was relied upon by them in order to contend that a forum which did not have the jurisdiction could not entertain the same. These judgments were distinguished by the learned ADJ by observing that they related to territorial jurisdiction and not to subject-matter jurisdiction which admittedly the ADJ had in the instant case. The learned ADJ in support of his reasoning relied upon two judgments cited by the learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner to contend that it had the jurisdiction because the ground of cruelty was a ground for which a provision existed as a ground for divorce under both the enactments. The case relied upon are titled Anupam Das v.Smt. Mampi Das; AIR 2008 Gau (3) 2007 and Prabir Chandra Chatterjee vs. Kaveri Guha Chatterjee; AIR 1987 Calcutta 191.Suman Kundra vs Sanjeev Kundra on 28 May, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177304220/ 210. I have heard both Mr. Chandhiok, the learned senior counsel for the appellant as well as Mr. Jai Bansal, the learned counsel for the respondent. 11. Mr. Chandhiok, the learned senior counsel for the appellant has made the following submissions :- 12. The first contention is that if the marriage is solemnized under the Special Marriage Act, then one cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court exercising the powers under Hindu Marriage Act as in that case, the court will not have the jurisdiction over the subject-matter unless and until it is not a family court under the Family Court Act. In order to support his submissions, he has placed reliance on Stephen Joshus & Anr. Vs. JS. Kapoor; (1995) 58 DLT 57; Mohan Raj vs. Violet Chandra; (1993) 1 ALL India HLR 108; and D. Jacintha Kamath vs. K. Padmanabha Kamath; AIR 1992 Kant 372. 13. In Stephen Joshus's case (supra), the question which had arisen was whether a Christian married under the Christian Marriage Act could be granted divorce on the basis of mutual consent under Special Marriage Act. The submission which was made before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi was that since under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, mutual consent is a ground of divorce it is equally applicable to all the citizens of India irrespective of the fact that as to whether the marriage is solemnized under the same or other provisions of law. Section 28 of the Christian Marriage Act does not create a bar on grant of divorce by mutual consent. 14. This contention was negatived by the High Court stating that the divorce can be granted only on the grounds which are available under a particular act under which parties have got married meaning thereby that since parties were married under the Christian Marriage Act and under the said Act there was no provision for grant of divorce by mutual consent and therefore their marriage could not be dissolved by mutual consent. Similar is the judgment in Mohan Raj's case (supra). 15. In D. Jacintha Kamath's case (supra) the question which had arisen was whether a Christian marriage where one of the parties is Hindu can be dissolved by a decree of divorce under Section 13 of HMA at the instance of either of the parties. This contention was also negated by Karnataka High Court on the ground that for the purpose of dissolution of marriage under Hindu Marriage Act the parties have to be necessarily Hindus and married according to Hindu rites and ceremonies, customary or ones which are prescribed under the said Act. 16. None of the aforesaid three judgments, in my view, are helpful to the petitioner because the ground on the basis of which the divorce is sought in the instant case is cruelty and/or desertion under the Hindu Marriage Act which are also the grounds under the Special Marriage Act. Therefore, the question which arises for consideration is whether a divorce petition under Section 13 of HMA filed by one of the parties both being Hindu but married under Special Marriage Act, be dismissed merely on the premise that the same ought to have been filed under Section 27 of Special Marriage Act.Suman Kundra vs Sanjeev Kundra on 28 May, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/177304220/ 3","['28', '13', '15', '27']"
359,"Jammu & Kashmir High Court Jai Krishan Pandita vs Nana Kumari on 14 September, 2007 Equivalent citations: AIR 2008 J K 21 Author: J Singh Bench: J Singh ORDER J.P. Singh, J. 1. Parties to this petition are husband and wife. Petitioner husband's petition seeking dissolution of parties' marriage by a Divorce decree under Section 13 of the J & K Hindu Marriage Act, 1980, was pending consideration before learned Additional District Judge (Matrimonial Cases) Jammu, when the respondent wife filed an application seeking a direction against the petitioner to return her 'Istri Dhan' and other gifted items which had been given to her by her parents and friends. 2. The petitioner absented from the proceedings and his petition under Section 13 of the Act was dismissed in default of appearance on 31-12-2004. Respondent's application seeking recovery of Istri Dhan and gifted items however, continued to proceed in which the petitioner was set ex parte. 3. Vide order dated 24th of March 2005, learned Additional District Judge (Matrimonial Cases) Jammu, while allowing respondent's application directed the petitioner to hand over the Istri Dhan mentioned in Annexure ""A"" to respondent's application, to the respondent within a month's time. 4. Aggrieved by the order, the petitioner has invoked this Court's civil revisional jurisdiction to annul the impugned order of learned Additional District Judge (Matrimonial Cases) Jammu. 5. Petitioner's learned Counsel Mr. Ashok Bhan contends that the impugned order is without jurisdiction as with the dismissal of petitioner's petition for dissolution of Marriage, the Matrimonial Court would cease to have any jurisdiction to pass orders contemplated by Section 33 of the J & K Hindu Marriage Act. 6. Disputing the proposition of law urged by the petitioner's counsel, Respondent's Advocate Mr. Rajesh Oswal submits that impugned order was justified in view of the law laid down by the High Court of Jharkhand in S. Paramjit Singh v. Amarjit Kaur reported as 2005 (3) Marriage and Divorce Judicial Reports 396. 7. In the alternative, learned Counsel sought to support the impugned order on the strength of power vested in a Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 8. I have considered the submissions made and judgments cited at the Bar. 9. Resolution of the question raised at the Bar as to whether or not a Matrimonial Court would continue to possess jurisdiction to pass appropriate orders under Section 33 of the Act regardless of the cessation of main proceedings, requires a closer look on the provisions of J & K Hindu Marriage Act, 1980.Jai Krishan Pandita vs Nana Kumari on 14 September, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/817887/ 110. Section 33 of the Hindu Marriage Act which had been invoked by the respondent for seeking return of her Istri Dhan and gifted items given at the time of the marriage, opens with the expression ""In any proceeding under this Act"" and contemplates making of requisite provision in the Decree itself regarding the disposal of the property given to the parties at or about the time of their marriage. 11. The expression ""In any proceedings under the Act the Court may make such provision in the decree"" demonstrates that pendency of proceedings contemplating passing of a ""Decree"" under the Hindu Marriage Act is the ""sine qua non"" for exercise of jurisdiction under Section 33 of the Act. Section 33 does not of itself gives any right to the parties to the matrimonial dispute to maintain independent proceedings for disposal of the property given to them at or about the time of the marriage. 12.With the dismissal of petitioner's petition seeking Decree for dissolution of marriage, respondent's right to prosecute and maintain her claim for disposal of the property given at or about the time of the marriage would, therefore, cease before the Matrimonial Court. 13. In this view of the matter, passing of the impugned order, by the Matrimonial Court when petitioner's petition under Section 13 of the J & K Hindu Marriage Act stood dismissed in default of appearance, cannot be sustained and justified. 14. I do not find any merit in petitioner's counsel's yet another submission that dismissal of petitioner's petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act amounts to a ""decree"" and the impugned order even when passed subsequently, would be treated as a part of the decree passed by the Court, for the simple reason that dismissal of the petition in default of appearance, looked from any angle, cannot be construed as a decree muchless, a decree under the Act. Even the Code of Civil Procedure does not recognize the dismissal of a suit in default of appearance, as a decree and specifically excludes it from the definition of the decree as it appears in Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 15. That apart, I have not been able to persuade myself to agree with the view of their Lordships of the High Court of Jharkhand that even dismissal of a suit for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce, would amount to a ""decree"" as contemplated by the provisions of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 16.The Jammu and Kashmir Hindu Marriage Act, 1980, which contains similar provisions as that of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, contemplates four types of decrees which may be passed by a Matrimonial Court: First Decree for Restitution of Conjugal Rights; Second, Decree for Judicial Separation; Third, Decree for nullity of Marriage;Jai Krishan Pandita vs Nana Kumari on 14 September, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/817887/ 2And Fourth, Decree for Divorce. 17. A plain reading of Section 33 of the Act, makes it explicit that the legislature had intended to vest power in the Matrimonial Court to deal with the property of the parties given to them at or about the time of marriage, while passing a decree under the Act. Making of provisions in the decree in terms of Section 33 of the Act, indicates passing of a positive decree under any one of the Sections 9 to 15 of the Act rather than dismissal of a spouse's petition seeking a positive relief for grant of decree in his or her favour. Dismissal of a spouse's petition may not thus require exercise of jurisdiction for making provision for disposal of the property in terms of Section 33 of the Act. 18. Dismissal of a spouse's main petition seeking positive relief of restitution of conjugal rights, dissolution decree or decree for nullity of marriage would not thus amount to a ""decree"" contemplated by Section 33 of the Act giving authority to the Matrimonial Court to deal with the property of the parties given at or about the time of the marriage. 19. A Division Bench judgment of the High Court of Orissa, reported as Akasam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parvati AIR 1967 Orissa 163 while dealing with a similar question, holds as follows: (8) It was urged that the words ""any decree"" occurring in Section 25(1) contemplates any of the decrees passed under Sections 9 to 13 of the Act and it was only in the event of any such decree being passed that the Court will have jurisdiction to order payment of permanent alimony in favour of husband or wife as the case may be. In other words, the contention is that when the suit of the plaintiff was dismissed it is not open to the Court to pass an order of alimony in favour of the wife. There appears to be some force in this contention. Under Sections 9 to 14 of the Act, the Court could pass substantive decree granting any of the reliefs provided thereunder. Section 25(1) of the Act entitles the Court to pass any order for permanent alimony. The question is whether the Court is entitled to pass such order while dismissing the petition. The language of Section 25 is plain enough to indicate that the Court is not entitled to pass such an order while dismissed the petition. The words ""at the time of passing any decree do not include the case of a dismissal. The passing of an order of dismissal cannot be regarded as the passing of a decree. Several decisions have also been cited in support of such a view. (9) The Gujarat High Court in a case , Harilal Purusottam v. Lilavati Gokaldas, held that the Court will not have any jurisdiction to grant permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Act if a petition under any of the Sections 9 to 13 of the Act was dismissed. In the case , Shantaram Gopal v. Hirabai Shantaram, the husband filed a petition for judicial separation against the wife. Later on, the husband withdrew the petition. Sometime thereafter the wife made an application for alimony and maintenance under Section 25 of the Act. It was held that the existence of any of the decrees referred to in Sections 9 to 13 was a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 25(1) and as no decree for any kind was passed in the said case, the ancillary relief for permanent alimony and maintenance under Section 25(1) will not be available. The same view has also been taken in a later decision of the Bombay High Court reported in AIR 1964 Bom 83, Shantaram D. Karnik v. Malti Shantaram Karnik.Jai Krishan Pandita vs Nana Kumari on 14 September, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/817887/ 3","['15', '13', '2', '25']"

This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is directed against the judgment and Decree dated 14.07.2004, passed by the Judge, Family Court, Jodhpur, whereby the divorce petition filed by the appellant -' Purshotam Dass Under Section 13(1)(i)(ia)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, has been dismissed on the ground that the appellant has failed to produce any cogent and convincing evidence before the Family Court, which may persuade it to hold that the cruelty has been committed by the respondent-wife. 2. Brief facts, giving rise to the instant appeal, are that on 15.11.1997, the appellant - Purshotam Dass filed a petition for dissolution of marriage solemnized between the parties on 15.02.1989 on the ground that the respondent-wife, at the time of the marriage, was suffering from incurable skin disease and mental disorder and this fact was suppressed by the parents of the respondent-wife. It was also averred in the petition that the. behaviour of the respondent,-wife was cruel towards the appellant-husband and his family members. Not. only that, but she has also attempted to commit suicide by pouring kerosene on her body and she has also threatened to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the matrimonial house. On 18.10.1997, the respondent-wife executed an agreement on the stamp paper of Rs. 100/- that she is voluntarily leaving the house of her husband-Purshotam Das at Barmer and is going to Jodhpur. Whatever house-hold items given to her by her. parents at the time of marriage, are being taken by her to Jodhpur. She further stated in the written agreement that she does not want to remain in Barmer as she does not feel happy there., She also stated that she has requested her husband to leave Barmer and come down and settle at Jodhpur, but he did not accede to her request as he is a bonafide resident of Barmer and is carrying on business there. She stated that out of three, daughters, two elder daughters can live with her husband and she wants to retain the youngest daughter - Meghna with her. Lastly, she stated that she would be continuously receiving Rs. 700/- per month as maintenance allowance for herself and her youngest daughter - Meghna. No-one from her in-laws' side has pressurised her to leave Barmer and settle down at Jodhpur. 3. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the learned Family Court framed the issues to the effect that whether the respondent-'wife has committed cruelty with the appellant-husband as alleged in the petition. If so, then whether the appellant-petitioner-husband is entitled to get the decree of divorce against the respondent wife. 4. The petitioner-Purhshotamdas examined himself as P.W.I and stated that at the time of the marriage, his wife-Poornima was suffering from skin disease and was not mentally sound. Thus, according to the petitioner-husband, living with such type of wife itself is a cruelty. After marriage, he tried, to get her cured, but was unsuccessful and her entire body was giving foul smell. He also examined PW 2 Aasulal Khatri, who is known to both the parties. Aasulal expressed his inability, toPurshotam Dass vs Smt. Purnima on 24 May, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1668794/ 1make any statement with regard to skin disease, and mental disorder of the respondent-wife. However, he stated that Poornima was pressurising the appellant to leave Barmer and settle at Jodhpur and on not paying any heed to her wishes, she has threatened to commit suicide and had gone to the house of her parents. In the cross-examination, he stated that the stamp paper was purchased and executed by the respondent-wife as per her own sweet-will. He was also signatory to the document. 5. Poornima (NAW-1) has examined herself and stated in her statement that she was married with the appellant on .15.02.1989, according to the Hindu rites. At the time of fever, her skin turns white and she has to take the medicines and on taking medicines, the skin becomes quite normal. She stated that she does not have a regular skin disease. She also stated that she is not suffering from any mental disorder and is mentally sound. In the cross-examination, the respondent-wife stated that she has been suffering from skin disease right from childhood. She stated that prior to engagement, she herself has disclosed this fact to the petitioner-husband that at the time of fever, her skin turns white. She also stated that she is mentally sound, but she remains depressed due to headache. Bhanwarlal (NAW-2), who is father of the respondent-wife has stated that a sum of rupees one lakh was demanded from her daughter. He further stated that no demand was made at the time of the marriage and her in-laws' were behaving with her well. He also stated that the demand, of amount was not made by the husband of Pbornima. 6. The learned Judge, Family Court, Jodhpur decided both the issues against the petitioner-applicant Purshottam Dass and dismissed the petition vide Judgment dated 14.07.2004. 7. Being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 14.07.2004, the appellant has. filed the instant miscellaneous appeal. 8. It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned Family Court has not properly considered, the grounds raised in the divorce petition and has not considered the written statement, in which the facts of skin disease and mental disorder and living separately from the appellant-husband since 20.10.1997 are admitted. 9. It is also submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the respondent-wife has left the house of the husband-appellant on her own, without any reason and she has also misbehaved with the parents of the appellant. Apart from that, many a times, she has tried to commit suicide by pouring kerosene oil on her body and has also threatened the appellant to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the matrimonial house. According to the learned Counsel, these facts stand established and proved from the statement of P.W. 2 Aasulal. 10. It is contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned Family Court has also ignored the fact that the respondent-wife was suffering from the skin disease and was mentally unsound at the time of the marriage. This fact was deliberately suppressed by the parents of the respondent-wife at the time of marriage.Purshotam Dass vs Smt. Purnima on 24 May, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1668794/ 211. Lastly, it is argued by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the respondent-wife has left her matrimonial house on her own sweet-will, after executing the agreement (Exhibit 1- A) before the Notary Public. The respondent wife has also admitted her signature on Exhibit 1-A. Thus, the respondent-Wife is living separately from the husband-appellant since 20.10.1997. Since the respondent-wife herself has admitted that it is not possible for her to live with her husband at Barmer and has been living with her parents for the last 7 years at Jodhpur, so, on this count also, the decree Under Section 13 should be passed in favour of the appellant. Apart from that, looking to the considerable long period of separation as. well as the future of the parties, the decree of divorce should be granted to The appellant. Alternatively, it is submitted that Under Section 10 of the, Hindu Marriage Act, the decree for judicial separation may be passed as the wife is living separately from her husband- appellant for the last 7 seven years and she has admitted in Exhibit 1/A that it is not possible for her to live with ret husband at Barmer and slid has come to Jodhpur to settle down on her own sweet-will. 12. Per contra, it is submitted by the learned Counsel for the respondent-wife that the findings of the learned Family Court are perfectly justified and are based on sound reasonings and appreciation of the evidence available on record. Apart from that, the appellant-husband has failed to establish and prove cruelty, alleged to have been committed by the respondent-wife. So, the learned judge, Family Court, Jodhpur has rightly held that in the absence of any cogent and convincing evidence, it is not possible to pass any decree in favour of the appellant- husband Under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 13. It is further submitted by the learned Counsel for the respondent-wife that the learned Judge, Family Court, Jodhpur has rightly held that Exhibit 1-A - the agreement was executed on 18.10.1997 and the application for dissolution of marriage was filed by the appellant-husband on 15.11.1997. Thus, according to the learned Family Court, in order to obtain and initiate the proceedings for dissolution of marriage, the agreement (Exhibit 1-A) was got executed by the appellant-husband or at his behest. The learned Family Court also rightly found that it has come in evidence of Smt. Poornima that after executing the agreement (Exhibit 1-A) both have come to Jodhpur by taking domestic goods in the truck. Thus, according to the learned Family Court, it appears that by assuring her to live at Jodhpur together, the agreement (Exhibit 1-A) was got executed by or at the instance of husband-appellant. This agreement (Exhibit 1-A) was got executed, only with an ill intention to file a petition for dissolution of marriage. According to the learned Counsel, this fact stands corroborated from the. statement of Smt. Poornima herself, in which she has admitted that seven years ago, i.e., in the year, 1997, she has attempted to commit suicide by pouring kerosene oil on her body. learned Counsel submits that she was so mentally depressed that she attempted to commit suicide and in consequence thereof, the agreement (Exhibit 1-A) was executed. 14. It is also submitted by the learned Counsel for the respondent that the learned Family Court has rightly held that in the absence of any cogent and convincing evidence which may lead to the conclusion that the behaviour of the respondent-wife was so cruel that it was not possible for the appellant to live with her peacefully, the decree Under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be granted in favour of the appellant.Purshotam Dass vs Smt.

This civil 1st Misc. appeal is directed against the judgment arid decree dated Feb. 20, 1979, passed by District Judge, Jammu, dismissing the petition for divorce filed by the appellant. 2. The facts leading to the filing of the appeal may be noticed first. The appellant is the husband. Respondent is the wife, the marriage between the parties was solemnized on 7-3-1969. Parties lived together for some time. It appears that some matrimonial differences arose between the parties and an application for restitution of conjugal rights was filed by the appellant on 28-7-1970 and an ex parte decree was obtained by him on 3-11-1971. The appellant filed an execution application on 4/7th Mar., 1972, to which objections were filed by the respondent on 29-1-1973. The execution application was, however, consigned to records in absence of the parties on 8-5-1973. The appellant filed a petition for divorce - on 28-12-1973. The following issues were framed on 20-3-1974:-- 1. Whether the non-applicant has not complied with the decree of restitution of conjugal rights dated 3-11-1973? O. P. P. 2. Whether Section 13(1)(A) of the Central Hindu Marriage Act is applicable to the State of J. & K. ? O. P. D. 3. Whether the petitioner in asking for the relief of divorce is taking advantage of his own wrong? O. P. Non-applicant. 3. Initially, the onus of issue No. 3 was on respondent. She filed a revision in the High Court and the revision was allowed and the onus was changed in 1975, and modified issue, therefore, reads as follows:-- ""Whether the petitioner, husband in asking for divorce is not taking advantage of his own wrong or disability? O. P. P."" The appellant examined himself as his own witness and did not produce any other witness. The respondent, on the other hand, examined; Miss Phool Ghai, Subash Chander Rekhi, Ram Singh, Kewal Krishan, Romesh Kumar, Anand Saroop, Omparkash, Dharm Paul Ashutosh Sharma and herself appeared in the witness box. 4. After appraising the evidence,, the petition for divorce was rejected on 20-2-1979. Hence this appeal. 5. I shall refer to the evidence during the course of discussion as and where it is relevant.Man Mohan Kapoor vs Smt. Kailash Kumari on 24 November, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/967672/ 16. Mr. H.L. Bhagotra, learned counsel for the appellant, has urged that the learned District Judge fell in error in dismissing the petition for divorce without taking into consideration the attitude of the respondent and her written statement filed in the petition for restitution of conjugal rights. The learned counsel further urged that the evidence had not been properly appreciated; the onus of issues had been wrongly placed and that the provisions of Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act bad also been wrongly interpreted. Argued the learned counsel, that after coming into force of the J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1980, the position of Law had changed and the non-cohabitation for the statutory period by itself entitled the appellant to a decree for divorce and it was immaterial as to which party was at fault in this behalf. Learned counsel further submitted that since the respondent did not make any attempt to satisfy the decree, she could not be permitted to resist the petition for divorce, sought cm the ground that there bad been no restitution of conjugal rights between the parties to the marriage, after passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. In the alternative, Mr. Bhagotra argued that even if it be found that the husband had resisted the satisfaction of the decree, the resistance did not amount to a wrong within the meaning of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and as such the learned District Judge was in error, in taking recourse to the provisions of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act for denying a decree of divorce to the husband. 7. In reply Mr. R.P. Sethi, learned counsel for the respondent, has submitted that the wife respondent did not contest the petition for restitution of conjugal rights and that by itself establishes her bona fide that she did not resist the resumption of cohabitation between the parties and that she had no intention to break the matrimonial ties. Learned counsel submitted, that initially the onus of issue No. 3 was on the respondent, but after she filed the revision in the High Court, the onus was changed, and therefore, it did not lie in the mouth of the appellant to say that the onus of issues had been wrongly placed. According to learned counsel, the J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1980, did not apply to the facts and circumstances of the case because the Act was not in force when the petition under Section 9 was filed or when the decree was passed or when the execution application was filed and that the Act was also not in force when the petition under Section 13 was filed, dismissed and appealed against and, therefore, it is not open to the appellant to say that either party had the right to file a petition for divorce after a decree for restitution of conjugal rights had remained unsatisfied irrespective of the fact whether the party seeking divorce was taking advantage of his own wrong. It is further urged that there has been proper appreciation of evidence as well as application of law and that the petition for divorce has been rightly rejected by the learned District Judge. Reference has been made by the learned counsel to various interim orders passed by the Court in the execution application to urge that the husband appellant after having obtained the decree for restitution of conjugal rights was only marking time so that he could file a petition for divorce on the ground of non-satisfaction of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights and that the respondent had obtained the decree for restitution of conjugal rights only to be able to ask for divorce subsequently. 8. I have given my careful consideration to the respective contentions raised, at the bar and have perused the record. 9. Before proceeding further, it would be of advantage to take note of certain provisions of J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, as well as the J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act of 1980.Man Mohan Kapoor vs Smt. Kailash Kumari on 24 November, 1983 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/967672/ 210. Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 reads as follows : ""23. Decree in proceedings:--(1) In any proceeding under, this Act, whether defended or not, if the Court is satisfied that-- (a) any of the grounds for granting relief exists and the petitioner is not in any way taking advantage of his or her own wrong or disability for the purpose of such relief, and (b) where the ground of the petition is the ground specified to Clause (f) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10 or in Clause (i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13, the petitioner has not in any manner been accessory to or connived at or condoned the act or acts complained of, or where the ground of the petition is cruelty the petitioner has not in any manner condoned the cruelty, and (c) the petition, is not presented or prosecuted in collusion with the respondent, and (d) there has not been any unnecessary or improper delay in instituting the proceeding and (e) there is no other legal ground why relief should not be granted, then, and in such a case, but not otherwise, the Court shall decree such relief accordingly. (2) Before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court in the first instance in every case where it is possible so to do consistently with the nature and circumstances of the case, to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties"" This section provides that while granting relief, the Court has to satisfy itself whether the petitioner is not, in any way, taking advantage of his own wrong for the purposes of such relief. 11. Section 28 (1) (a) of the 1980 Act provides as under :-- ""28, Decree in proceedings :--(1) In any proceeding under this Act, whether defended or not, if the Court is satisfied that (a) any of the grounds for granting relief exists and the petitioner except in cases where the relief is sought by him on the ground specified in Clause (ii) of Section 5 or Sub-section (2) of Section 13 is not in any way taking advantage of his or her own wrong, or disability for the purpose of such relief; and ....................."" 12. According to the aforesaid provision, if the Court is satisfied that any of the grounds for granting relief exists, with the exceptions as detailed therein the Court shall proceed to pass the decree, under the Act of 1980, therefore with a view to get divorce under Section 13(2) all that is required to be established is that there has been non-cohabitation for the statutory period after the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation and it is not material as to which party was at fault in this behalf. The non-cohabitation is the sine qua non for grant of relief under Section 13 (2) of J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1980. This is a marked departure from the 1955 Act but, in my opinion, recourse to the provisions of J. & K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1980, with a view to set at naught the judgment and the decree of the learned District Judge is not permissible. Admittedly, the 1980 Act was not in force when the petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, was filed. ItMan Mohan Kapoor vs Smt.

Verma, J. 1. This appeal has been filed against the judgment delivered by a learned Single Judge, whereby the decree of the trial Court, dismissing the applicant's suit for a decree declaring the marriage null and void and, in the alternative, for judicial separation, has been affirmed on 29-8-1989, an application has been filed under Section 151 C.P.C. read with Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. This application is signed by both the parties (husband and wife), stating that they have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage as it is not possible for them to live together. The application is supported by an affidavit. Learned counsel admitted before us that the application has been signed by both the parties voluntarily. However, learned counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection that a petition under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act does not lie in an appeal arising out of any petition filed under the Hindu Marriage Act. The contention is that the proceedings initiated by an application under Section 13B of the Act partake the nature of an original proceeding and can be filed only in the original Court, namely, the Court of the District Judge. This order shall dispose of the preliminary objection. Under different provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, actions can be filed in the Court, either by the husband or by the wife, for restitution of conjugal rights (Section 9), for judicial separation (Section 10), for declaring a marriage null and void (Section 11), for avoiding marriage (Section 12) and for a decree of divorce (Section 13). By the Amending Act No. 68 of 1976, Section 13A and 13B have been added. Section 13B, which is relevant for the present purpose runs as follows :- ""13B (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the District Court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage was solemnized before or after the commencement of (he Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. (2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of the presentation of the petition referred to in sub-section (1) and not later than eighteen months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the Court shall, on being satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, that a marriage has been solemnized and that the averments in the petition are true, pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dis-solved with effect from the date of the decree."" By this Section, for the first time, it has been made permissible to file a joint petition by the husband and wife together for the relief of dissolution of marriage. On A perusal of the aforesaid previsions, which permit filing of actions in the Court for different reliefs under the Hindu Marriage Act, either by the husband or by the wife or by both together, it will be seen that the actions are to be initiatedSakattar Singh vs Raj @ Raj Rani on 23 April, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1614541/ 1in the Court of the District Judge by a petition. Proceedings Under Section 13B have to be initiated by a petition to be presented to the District Court. At the same time, the Act also conceives of certain application which can be made in the Course of proceedings initiated in the District Court by presenting a petition under the different provisions of the Act, as mentioned above. For example, Section 24 which permits grant of maintenance pendente lute and expenses of proceedings, speaks of an application in any proceeding under the Act. Similarly, Section 25. which contains the provision for grant of permanent alimony and maintenance also speaks of making of an application for the purpose in the pending proceedings under the Act. Likewise, Section 26 also speaks of an application in a pending proceeding in the Court under the Act, directing custody, maintenance and education of minor children. Further, Section 19 of the Act dealing with jurisdiction and procedure under the Act, Specifically provides that every petition under the Act shall be presented to the District Court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction the marriage was solemnized, etc. To us it is clear that the Legislature has expressed its clear intention in Section 19 that all petitions contemplated under the Act have to be presented to the District Court. A petition under Section 13B of the Act, which permits a decree of divorce by consent of the parties to the marriage, is a petition under the Act and is for a relief not provided for in any other petition under the Act, and has to be presenter before the District Court. It is difficult to accept the contention that a petition under Section 13B of the Act is an application, which can be presented for a relief of a decree of divorce by mutual consent in proceeding another wife any other petition filed under the Act for different reliefs of either restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation, etc. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the husband and wife, seeking to dissolve their marriage by mutual consent have to initiate proceedings in the District Court by presenting a petition to it. 2. The view that we take in this regards, as aforesaid, further finds support from the fact that before a decree of dissolution of marriage can be passed in a petition under Section 13B of the Act, certain grounds have to be made out as contained in that provision. The parties have to make out (1) that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more; (2) that they have not been living together; and (3) that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. But this is not all. In terms of sub-Section (2) of Section 13B, the District Court, 'before whom such a petition is presented has to wait for a period of six months before the petition can be taken up for consideration. The Court has then to be satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiries as it thinks fit, that the marriage has been solemnized and that the averments in the petition are true. It is only on recording such satisfaction that the Court shall pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved from the date of the decree Thus, sub-Section (2) of Section 13B casts a duty upon the Court, dealing with such a petition, to make such inquiries as may be necessary under the. circumstances of the case, to hear the parties and then to record satisfaction that the averments in the petition are true. A decree passed under Section 13B of the Act is undoubtedly appealable as any other decree passed under the Act by the District Court. Permitting such a petition under Section 13B of the Act to be filed in the appellate Court in an appeal against the decree passed by the District Court in a petition presented under the other provisions of the Act, would apparently mean depriving the party aggrieved by that decree, of the right of appeal which the Act otherwise provides. This is yet another reason why we 'feel that a petition under Section 13B of the Act should be made only before the District Court and not in the appeal arising out of the decree passed on a petition under the other provisions of the Act.Sakattar Singh vs Raj @ Raj Rani on 23 April, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1614541/ 23. Learned counsel for the appellant cited certain cases decided by this Court wherein appeals filed against the decree passed under other provisions of the Act, petitions under Section 13B of the Act were entertained and on satisfaction of the requirements of that provision, a decree of divorce by mutual consent has been passed. Learned counsel, however, could not place any decision, which has considered the issue as to the forum where such a petition should be presented. Learned counsel, however, placed before us a decision of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Apurba v. Manashi, (AIR 1989 Cal. 115). That was an appeal by the husband against the wife from dismissal of his petition for dissolution of marriage on the ground of the wife's alleged mental disorder. In the appeal, a joint petition was filed praying for dissolution of the marriage on a decree of divorce on the terms and conditions contained in that application. The question arose whether such a course was permissible under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. Division Bench expressly stated in para 9 of the judgment that it did not propose to determine the question if such an application under Section 13B of the Act can be presented in an appeal, as it was of opinion that it could record a compromise and decree dissolution of marriage under Order 23 Rule 3 Code of Civil Procedure which applies to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act by force of Section 21 thereof. It is in this context that the Calcutta High Court said that as in an appeal from a decree in a civil suit, so also in an appeal from a decree passed on a petition under Section 13 for dissolution of marriage, an application for dissolving such marriage by consent can be entertained, treated and decided as an application under Order 23, Rule 3, C.P.C. It has, therefore, been held that such an application may be entertained in appeal but can be allowed only if there already existed a ground for a decree of divorce under the provisions of Section 13 of the Act. We may, however, mention that a Division Beach of this Court in Ravishankar v. Sharda Vishwakarma, (1977 M.P.L.J. 784), dealt with the matter slightly differently. That was a case initiated on a petition under Section 13B of-the Act filed in the District Court. The parties examined themselves to say that the application was an outcome of their free will and that they wanted the marriage to be dissolved. The District Court was, however, of the opinion that unless the grounds as contemplated by Section 13 are made out, no decree for divorce can be passed. This Court, in appeal, held the view of the District Court to be erroneous and that on a plain construction of Section 13B, a decree has to be passed, if the conditions laid down therein exist It was specifically said that Section 13B does not require the parties seeking a divorce by mutual consent to prove anything in addition to that laid down in Section 13B. This indicates that the Division Bench of this Court was of the view that ""the proceedings under Section 13B of the Act are substantive and independent proceedings in themselves and have to be treated and decided on their own premises"" and only in accordance with Section 13B. This is a strong indication that proceedings under Section 13B are proceedings independent of any other proceeding under the Act and have to be initiated and dealt with de hors and independent of any other proceeding, including an appeal against the decree passed under any other provision of the Act. The Calcutta decision therefore, proceeds on an entirely different line and is not an authority for the proposition that a petition under Section 13B of the Act can be filed and entertained in an appeal arising out of a decree passed by the Court in proceedings under other provisions of the Act. 4. Another decision which makes attention in this regard is K. Omprakash v. K. Nalini, (AIR 1986 A.P. 167). It was held that the provisions of Section 13B(2) which is a part of mere procedure"", would became unworkable if held to be mandatory. Dealing with the nature of the provisions of Section 13B(2) of the Act, the Court observed ""that it could not have been the intention of Section 13B(2)Sakattar Singh vs Raj @ Raj Rani on 23 April, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1614541/ 3","['26', '15', '13', '24', '19', '21', '25']"

Kamat, J. 1. The disastrous consequences of the age old anxiety for the birth of a male child that are suffered by the appellant No. 1 in this appeal are writ large on the face of the present proceedings. 2. The question that is posed by this appeal is whether the appellant No. 1 can base her claim for maintenance under section 18(2)(d) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, inspite of the fact that her marriage is not legal in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This claim has been denied by the trial court, leaving her to approach this court by this appeal. 3. On January 8, 1975, the appellant No.1 - Vaijayantabai for herself and on behalf of the appellant No. 2, her daughter Taibai, filed in forma pauperis Special Civil Suit No. 130 of 1975 in the court of the Second Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Ahmednagar for maintenance, arrears thereof, the marriage expenses and the cost of the suit. 4. Practically all the facts which form the basis of the claim are admitted or proved, and it is so held by the learned trial Judge. They are briefly stated as follows : The original defendant-Keru Gangarde, an agriculturist of village Mandali, having large properties consisting of agricultural lands and houses, initially married to Ambai who gave birth to eight daughters, Out of whom, seven daughters are alive. He wanted a son and, therefore, married the appellant No. 1- Vaijayanta, 23 years before the suit, according to Hindu rituals at village Sakat Tq. Ashti. 5. Thereafter for a period of 15 years, Keru and Vaijayanta led a happy married life. Vaijayanta gave birth two daughters - Babai, aged about 20 years and Tai, aged about 11 years, on the date of suit. 6. Finding that not only Ambai gave birth to eight daughters but also Vaijayanta gave birth but consecutively to two daughters, it is alleged, Keru started illtreating Vaijayanta, obviously for her not giving birth to a son. Vaijayanta was neglected and then Vaijayanta and her two daughters were driven out of the matrimonial home. 7. Vaijayanta went to reside with her parents at village Sakat. The parents made efforts through the villagers for maintenance from Keru who refused his liability to maintain Vaijayanta and her minor daughter Tai. 8. A notice dated April 28, 1971, was sent through the advocate calling upon Keru to make arrangements for maintenance of Vaijayanta and her daughters. The notice also claimed for arrangements for the marriage expenses of Babai. Keru did not pay any heed nor made anyVaijayantabai W/O Keru Gangarde ... vs Keru Anant Gangarde, Since ... on 19 February, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/773314/ 1arrangement for the marriage expenses. Vaijayanta's father Bapurao, by spending an amount of Rs. 16,000/-, got Babai married. 9. Vaijayanta has alleged that Keru owns about 46 Acres of land which include Bagayat land fetching him an yearly income of Rs. 20,000/-. She alleged that Keru is in possession of silver and gold ornaments and does money-lending business. The suit was, therefore, filed for a claim of maintenance at Rs. 100/- per month for Vaijayanta and for Rs. 50/- per month for Tai from the date of the suit; for an amount of Rs. 23,250/- towards marriage expenses of Babai and arrears of maintenance for a period of 3 years prior to the suit. 10. The suit was resisted by the written statement (Exhibit 29) wherein Keru Gangarde had admitted marriage with Vaijayanta 23 years prior to the suit. Keru also admitted paternity of the two daughters - Babai and Tai. Obviously, Keru has denied his driving away Vaijayanta alongwith her daughters and other averments in the plaint in regard thereto. 11. Broadly on these pleadings, the learned Judge by Exhibit 21 framed the following issues:- ""(1) Whether the plaintiffs prove that plaintiff No.1 is legally entitled to claim maintenance from the defendant? (2) Whether the plaintiffs prove that plaintiff No. 2. is legally entitled to claim maintenance? (3) Whether the plaintiffs prove that the defendant deserted and refused to maintain them? (4) Whether the defendant is liable to pay maintenance. If yes, then what quantum? (5) Whether the defendant is liable to pay expenses for the marriage of Babai. If yes, then what quantum? (6) Whether the suit is barred by limitation? (7) Whether this Court has jurisdiction to try the suit? (8) What order and decree?"" 12. The only issue to be considered is the legal liability of the defendant -Keru for maintaining the present plaintiffs. 13. The learned Judge, by the impugned judgment, has recognised and granted maintenance of Rs. 50/- to plaintiff No. 2, as well as the amount of arrears of maintenance for a period of 3 years prior thereto by creating the necessary charge of maintenance on the property of Keru bearing Survey No. 37 of village Mandali Tq. Karjat Dist. Ahmednagar by directing the Revenue Officer to make the necessary mutation entry in the Record of Rights of the suit property.Vaijayantabai W/O Keru Gangarde ... vs Keru Anant Gangarde, Since ... on 19 February, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/773314/ 214. The learned Judge held, as far as the appellant No. 1 - Vaijayanta is concerned, that the claim to maintenance under section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, can be recognised only in respect of a legally wedded wife and is not extended to any other woman under any circumstances. The learned Judge came to this conclusion in view of the fact that the marriage of Keru with Ambai was subsisting rendering the marriage of Keru with appellant No. 1 as illegal and void in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. 15. The learned Judge came to this conclusion on the basis of the admitted position not only on the basis of the averments in the written statement, but also on the basis of the evidence of Keru married the appellant No. 1 before 22 years, and regarded Ambai as his first wife and the appellant No. 1 - Vaijayanta as his second wife. 16. On behalf of the appellant No. 1 - Vaijayanta, she examined herself (Exhibit 37) to contend that at the time of her marriage with Keru, the persons concerned were represented that Keru had already divorced Ambai. Vaijayanta's father Bapurao is also examined at Exhibit 40 who also repeated that Keru told him that he had divorced Ambai. On behalf of the plaintiffs, one Raoji Mhaske - Exhibit 41 - is also examined as a witness for the marriage of Keru and Vaijayanta, as a distant relative of Vaijayanta. Additionally, Vaijayanta's brother Kisan Bapurao is also examined. 17. Keru examined himself at Exhibit 43, and as stated above, he has admitted marriage with Vaijayanta. Keru had stated that he had about 80 Acres of land at the time of his marriage with Vaijayanta and he sold about 30 Acres thereafter out of the said land. He had stated that he gets about Rs. 1500/- as income from the land in question. However, he has admitted that he has not sold any land during the period of plaintiff No. 1's stay as a married wife with him. 18. Thus, the evidence on record shows that Keru treated Vaijayanta as his wife, almost legally married. Keru and Vaijayanta resided together in the matrimonial home well-nigh for a period of 15 years thereafter. The friends, relatives and villagers recognised Keru and Vaijayanta as husband and wife. The consistent evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs shows that Keru made a representation at the time of settlement of the marriage that he had divorced Ambai and the marriage with Vaijayanta was settled in pursuance of this representation by Keru. 19. The necessary basic facts for the purpose of deciding the question as to whether Vaijayanta is entitled to a claim for maintenance as per her suit are, therefore, crystal clear that Keru treated Vaijayanta as his wife and cohabited with her for a period of 15 years after the marriage giving birth to two daughters. 20. During the pendency of the appeal Keru Gangarde expired and his heirs and legal representatives have been duly brought on record. The appeal came to be transferred to this Bench and transfer notices have been duly served on the appellants. Even after the service of the transfer notices, none appeared for them and, therefore, firstly in view of the fact that this is an old matter and also in view of the fact that this appeal raises an important question for decision, by order dated February 1991, I requested Shri R. G.

Narasimha Reddy, J 1. These two appeals are preferred against the judgment and decree in OS No. 364 of 1993 of the Court of the III Additional Judge, City Civil Courts, Secunderabad. CCCA No. 91 of 1996 is preferred by the 1st defendant whereas CCCA No. 210 of 2001 is preferred by the plaintiffs in the suit. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as plaintiffs and defendants. 2. The brief facts of the case are that the 2nd plaintiff is the wife, 1st plaintiff is the son and plaintiffs 3 to 5 are the daughters of late Sankuri Balaiah. It is the case of the plaintiffs that late Balaiah developed intimacy with one Chandramma since the year 1960 and both of them lived together as husband and wife. Late Balaiah provided maintenance as well as certain funds to Chadramma and she in turn invested them in the form of Fixed Deposits (FDs) in the 2nd defendant-bank. Two such FDs are dated 20-2-1992 and 28-4-1992 for an amount of Rs. 1,58,392-00 and Rs. 3,00,000/-respectively. Balaiah died on 12-11-1992 and Chandramma died on 25-9-1993. The nominations said to have been made by Chandramma in favour of the 1st defendant as regards the two FDs are tainted with misrepresentation and the said nominations are alleged to be not valid. Since Chandramma was the 2nd wife of Balaiah, the plaintiffs are the legal heirs to succeed to her estate. The suit was filed claiming the relief of a declaration that the plaintiffs are the legal heirs and successors and entitled to be paid the amounts belonging to the estate of Chandramma and permanent injunction against the 2nd defendant (Karnataka Bank) restraining it from paying or transferring the amounts covered by the said FDs. 3. The 1st defendant filed a written statement denying the averments in the plaint. It has been pleaded by the 1st defendant that late Chandramma had her own properties and she was never married to Balaiah and there was no relationship of wife and husband between them. It was the 1st defendant and his father that looked after Chandramma before her death and out of affection and gratitude for the service rendered to her, she nominated the 1st defendant to receive the amounts under the FDs. It is not necessary to refer to the pleadings in the written statement in minute details. 4. On the basis of the pleadings, the trial Court framed the following issues: ""1. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for declaration that they are heirs and successors of later Sunkuri Chandramma to entitle for the amounts belonging to the estate of late Chandramma? 2. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for injunction as prayed for? 3. Whether the amounts belonging to Chandramma exclusively and either plaintiffs or late Balaiah had no right over the said amount as contended by defendant?Sankuri Venkatesh vs Sankuri Ramdas And Ors. on 9 November, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1584249/ 14. Whether defendant No. 1 is nominee for the amounts of late Chadramma as such, he is only entitled for her amounts? The plaintiffs examined PWs. 1 to 3 and marked Exs.A1 to A3 and the defendant No. 1 examined DWs.1 to 3 and marked Exs.B1 to B29. Apart from the same, the documents in Exs.X1 to X5 as well as Ex.C1 were also marked. 5. On appreciation of oral and documentary evidence as well as the relevant case law, the trial Court answered Issue Nos.1 to 3 against the plaintiffs and Issue No. 4 against the 1st defendant and ultimately dismissed the suit. Aggrieved by the findings of the trial Court that the plaintiffs are not the legal heirs of late Chandramma, that they are not entitled for injunction against the 2nd defendant-bank and that the amounts in the FDs exclusively belong to late Chadramma and were not invested by late Balaiah, the plaintiffs preferred CCCA No. 210 of 2001. Aggrieved by the finding of the trial Court on Issue No. 4 that the nomination of defendant No. 1 as regards the payment of the amounts under the FDs is not proper, the 1st defendant filed CCCA No. 91 of 1996. 6. We have heard Sri P. V.R. Sharma, the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs and Sri Ch. Dhananjaya, the learned Counsel for the 1st respondent. 7. Sri P. V.R. Sharma contends that it was not in dispute that late Balaiah and Chandramma lived together since 1960 till Balaiah died in the year 1992 and a legal presumption can be drawn as to the relationship of husband and wife. Once such presumption exists, as per Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, the plaintiffs, being the legal heirs and successors of late Chandramma, are entitled for her estate. He also submits that the signature of Chandramma on the nomination forms, which are marked as Exs. B19 and B20, are at variance with her admitted signatures on other documents and since the difference can be noticed with a naked eye, the nominations cannot be said to be valid. 8. On the other hand, Sri Dhananjaya, the learned Counsel for the 1st defendant submits that mere living together of Balaiah and Chandramma does not bring about relationship of husband and wife between them in view of the fact that the 2nd plaintiff is no other than the legally wedded wife of late Balaiah and during the subsistence of that marriage, the 2nd marriage cannot be contracted, much less, presumed. Once the relationship between Balaiah and Chandramma cannot exist as husband and wife, there is no way the plaintiffs can inherit the estate of late Chandramma. So far as the nomination is concerned, he submits that late Chandramma had subscribed her signatures in the presence of the concerned bank officials and the minor variation in her signature, which is attributable to her old age and failing health, cannot invalidate her nomination. 9. In view of the above submissions, the following questions arise for consideration in these appeals: 1. Whether the plaintiffs can succeed to the estate of late Chandramma? 2. Whether the nominations made by late Chandramma in favour of the 1st defendant as regards the two FDs (Exs.B19 and B20) are enforceable in law?Sankuri Venkatesh vs Sankuri Ramdas And Ors. on 9 November, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1584249/ 210. The case of the plaintiffs depends mainly on the fact whether there existed the relationship of husband and wife between late Balaiah and late Chandramma. It is from this fact that all other subsidiary questions arise. It is only the relationship of late Balaiah as husband of late Chandramma that would provide a bridge to the plaintiffs to have access to the estate of late Chandramma through succession. Sri P. V.R. Sharma, the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs, strenuously contended that even the 1st defendant had admitted the fact that Chandramma and Balaiah lived together for almost three decades and the legal presumption can be drawn that such continuous cohabitation brings about the relationship of husband and wife between the two. Indisputably, the marriage between Balaiah and the 2nd plaintiff subsisted through out, till Balaiah died. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act stipulates the conditions that are to be fulfilled before solemnizing of any marriage. The first condition is that 'neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage."" Therefore, it has to be seen whether even the legal presumption that emerges on account of continuous cohabitation for a considerable period between late Chandramma and Balaiah, can bring about the marriage between them (even by presumption) de horse the subsistence of the matrimonial relationship of Balaiah with the 2nd plaintiff. 11. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that violation of the conditions contained in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act by itself does not annul a marriage, unless the same has been declared void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to him, as long as there was no declaration by a competent Court under Section 11, nothing can interdict the existence of the 2nd marriage and the consequences flowing therefrom. In support of his contention that the continuous living together for over three decades by Chandramma and Balaiah should result in a presumption of the existence of relationship of wife and husband between them, he relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.P.S. Balasubrahmanyam v. Suruttayan, . While there cannot be any quarrel with the proposition laid down therein, it has to be seen whether such presumption can bring about the marriage, which is prohibited under the Hindu Marriage Act. Reference in this regard may be made to Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which declares any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of the Act as void, if, at the time of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living. When the Section is so unequivocal and when the parties, even by their specific and express acts and intentions, cannot bring about a valid marriage, as long as one or both of them have a living spouse, the question of such marriage being brought into existence by presumption does not arise. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Surjit Kaur v. Garja Singh, (1994) SCC 407, is a total answer to this. In the said judgment, the principle lad down in B.S. Lokhande v. State of Maharashtra was reiterated and followed. The principle is as under: ""If the marriage is not a valid marriage, it is no marriage in the eye of law. The bare fact of a man and a woman living as husband and wife does not, at any rate, normally give them the status of husband and wife even though they may hold themselves out before society as husband and wife and the society treats them as husband and wife"" 12. The plaintiffs have also come forward with a plea that even though Chandramma and Balaiah are no more, the relationship between them can be decided by the Court. In support of their contention, they relied upon the judgment of the Madras High Court in Ponnuthayee Ammal v.

Aggrieved by the judgments and decrees of the trial Court and the appellate Court, the defendant has preferred this second appeal formulating the following questions as substantial questions of law: ""(1) Whether a marriage can be declared as null and void by a civil court without its having been got so declared during the life time of one of the spouses? (2) What is meant by 'custom' and how it can be proved and could a custom pleaded by a party be refused to be adjudicated if the same is not found to be ancient in nature and on the other hand being of recent origin? (3) Can oral evidence led by a party be held as inadmissible in evidence when the documentary evidence thereof has to be in possession of the opposite party and could Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act be pressed into service to render oral evidence inadmissible in respect of a document which is claimed to be compulsorily required to be in writing? (4) When the cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued to a plaintiff in a suit for declaration? And (5) Can a Court declare the party of a lis invalid without putting the parties to specific issues regarding the invalidity of the mar riage?"" Some of the facts relevant for determining the questions of law formulated hereinabove are: that the respondent Kamla Devi filed a suit for declaration to the effect that she was the only legal heir entitled to inherit the estate of Inder Parkash, her husband with a prayer for directing the appellant herein not to proclaim herself as the widow of -- said Inder Parkash. The suit was resisted mainly on the ground that the same was barred by time and that Kamla Devi had been divorced by said Inder Parkash in accordance with the custom prevalent in Rajouri district. The appellant claimed to be the only legally wedded wife of the deceased. 2. On the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed the following issues: ""1. Whether plaintiff alone is entitled to the assets of deceased Inder Parkash and she is in possession of the assets of the deceased? OPP 2. On the proof of Issue No. 1, whether defendant is claiming herself to be the sole heir of deceased Inder Parkash and thus make a claim over the assets of the deceased? OPP. 3.

OPD"" The trial Court decreed the suit and the appeal filed by the appellant herein was also dismissed by the appellate Court below. 3. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 4. A cursory glance at the pleadings of the parties and the issues framed in the case would show that except the point regarding the custom, the other points raised, in fact, do not arise in the case. There does not appear to be any substantial question of law in this case in terms of the tests laid down by this Court in Surram Singh v. Lal Chand, 1987 SLJ 345, wherein it was held: ""If a question of law finally determines the rights between the persons and is debatable in view of the authorities or that the authorities require reconsideration or the judgment has been passed completely ignoring the evidence of the parties or that the judgment has not taken into account the statutory provisions of the settled proposition of law or that there was lack of jurisdiction in the Court deciding the rights of the parties or when the rights of the parties are directly and substantially affected on a point of law not finally settled by the High Court, the Privy Council, Federal Court or that the judgment has been passed completely ignoring the pleadings of the parties, would be ""substantial question of law"" for the purpose of this section irrespective of the fact that the said substantial question of law is not of general public importance."" However, as the point of law regarding the validity of the marriage has been argued at ength and dealt with by the Courts below, I have preferred to adjudicate upon the same in this appeal. 5. Section 11 of the J. and K. Hindu Marriage Act, 1980 (hereinafter called 'the Act') declares the marriages solemnised in contravention of the conditions specified in Clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of Section 5 of the Act to be void. The word ""void"" is not defined in the Act, but, generally in the strict sense means that an instrument or transaction which is nugatory and ineffectual being not curable. It means empty, without force, null, ineffectual and having no legal force or binding effect. Presumed to be non-existent in the eye of law, no duty is cast upon any aggrieved party to seek a declaration from a court under the Act regarding the factum of a marriage being void. Giving any other interpretation would amount to legalising the action of the guilty at his instance or at the instance of the erring spouse solemnising the second marriage in existence of the first marriage. Marriages under the Act can be declared void or voidable or a decree of divorce and judicial separation can be passed only at the instance of a party to the marriage who is aggrieved within the meaning of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Act. It means, therefore, that a void marriage can be got declared as such by the second wife and by no other person or party. To defeat the provisions of law the erring parties solemnising a second marriage can allow the marriage to continue during their lifetime and thereby frustrate the provisions of the Act aimed at achieving social objective. The legislature clearly made a distinction between 'void' and 'voidable' marriages by making specific provision in Section 12 of the Act. The innocent party can treat the marriage nullitySmt. Lajya Devi vs Smt. Kamla Devi on 21 May, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/223933/ 2and ignore it because the erring party is presumed to be aware of the position of law and treat such second marriage to be non-existent in the eye of law. The Bombay High Court in Bajirao Raghoba Tambare v. Tolanbai Bhagwan Tonga 1980 Cri LJ 473, dealt with the matter and held at page 475 : ""A marriage in contravention of Section 5(l), Hindu Marriage Act, is null and void and it cannot create a legal status of husband and wife between the parties, though the necessary ceremonies may have been gone through. Though Section 11 gives a right to the parties to file a petition for a decree declaring the marriage a nullity, the filing of such a petition is not a condition precedent for putting an end to the marriage. What ultimately is declared on such a petition is nothing but the status of the party, as on the date of marriage and, therefore, the marriage does not continue to remain valid until a decree is passed. What is null and void cannot be deemed to be in existence for any purpose whatsoever. If, therefore, a marriage is solemnised in contravention of Section 5(i), the woman cannot get the status of a wife, nor can the male get the status of husband qua her. For a valid marriage which alone can confer the status of wife, not only the ceremonies under the personal law must be gone through, but the marriage must conform to the statutory requirements of Sections 5 and 11, Hindu Marriage Act, in the case of Hindu. A clear distinction is made between void and voidable marriages. While Section 11 contemplates void marriage, Section 13 postulates marriages that are voidable."" In Sheelawati v.

I am not inclined to agree with the view taken in Sheelawati's case. The judgment on Sheelawati's case was not approved and while dissenting with the said decision, B. N. Sapru, J. of that Court (Allahabad High Court) referred the following question to a Division Bench: ""Whether the view taken in Smt. Sheela-wati v. Smt. Ram Nandani, AIR 1981 All 42 is correct in so far as it lays down that the validity of a void marriage being in contravention of the provisions of Section 5 (i) read with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be gone into at the instance of a third aggrieved party after the death of the spouses to the marriage.""Smt.

Narayana, J. 1. The suit O.S.No. 81/96 on the file of Junior Civil Judge, Nandaloor was filed by one Nallagondla Kanthamma against General Manager, Integral Coach Factory, Madras, Chief Personal Officer, Integral Coach Factory, Madras for declaration that she is the legally wedded wife of Nallagondla Penchalaiah who died on 19-6-1996 while working in Integral Coach Factory, Madras and entitled to receive the benefits i.e., Provident Fund, Gratuity, Pension, Leave Salary and other privileges incidental thereto and also for permanent injunction and mandatory injunction. The 3rd defendant one Nallagondla Rajyam was impleaded as party by virtue of an order dated 29-6-1998 in I.A. No. 500/96. 2. On the respective pleadings of the parties after settlement of issues, P.W.1 and D.W.1 to D.W.6 were examined and Exs.A-1 to A-7 and Exs.B-1 to B-4 were marked. The learned Junior Civil Judge, Nandaloor, on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence, had declared that the plaintiff is the legally wedded wife of late Nallagondla Penchalaiah, entitled to receive the benefits due to the deceased Penchalaiah and the suit was decreed without costs by the judgment and decree dated 2-4-1999. Aggrieved by the same, the 3rd defendant filed A.S.No. 24/99 on the file of Senior Civil Judge, Rajampet. 3. Respondents 4 to 7, the children of the said Penchalaiah through Rajyam, the 3rd defendant, were added as parties in I.A. No. 11/2001 dated 25-1-2001. The Appellate Court vide Judgment and decree dated 2-2-2001 had modified the judgment and decree of the Trial Court declaring that the plaintiff/1st respondent and the 3rd defendant/appellant, the two widows of Penchalaiah, along with Respondents 4 to 7 as Class I heirs, are equally entitled to receive the benefits due to the deceased Penchalaiah from the office of Integral Coach Factory, Perambur, Madras. It was also specifically stated that the widows are entitled to receive in equal shares. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff filed S.A. No. 313/2001 and the 3rd defendant and her children filed S.A. No. 1165/2001. Hence, both these Appeals are being disposed of by this Common Judgment. 4. For the purpose of convenience, the plaintiff is referred to as the ""first wife"" and the 3rd defendant is referred to as the ""second wife"" and Respondents 4 to 7, the children of the deceased Penchalaiah through the second wife added as parties at the appellate stage are referred to as ""children"". 5. The only question which was raised and elaborately argued by the respective parties is, whether the second wife is entitled to receive any of the benefits due to the deceased husband. 6. Sri Eswaraiah Choudary, the learned Counsel representing the first wife with all vehemence had contended that inasmuch as the first wife is living, by virtue of Section 5(1) of the Hindu MarriageNallagondla Kanthamma vs Nallagondala Rajyam And Ors. on 19 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/802256/ 1Act, 1955, hereinafter referred to as ""Act"" for the purpose of convenience, read with Section 11 of the Act, the second marriage is void and hence the finding of the Appellate Court that the second wife also is entitled to receive the benefits due to the deceased husband cannot be sustained at all. The learned Counsel also had drawn my attention to the oral and documentary evidence available on record and had submitted that in view of the admissions made in Ex.A-4, the counter in M.C.No. 1/85 and also the evidence of D.W.6, it is clear that as a fact it was proved that the plaintiff alone is the first wife of the deceased Penchalaiah. The learned Counsel also commented that though an attempt is made to show that the plaintiff again had remarried by examining D.W.5 unless she is a divorced wife, the said marriage cannot be said to be a marriage at all in the eye of law and hence in view of the oral and documentary evidence the finding recorded by the Appellate Court in this regard cannot be sustained, 7. Sri R.S. Murthy, the learned Standing Counsel representing Defendants 1 and 2 had contended that in view of the nomination made by Penchalaiah, irrespective of the fact that the 3rd defendant is the second wife, she alone is entitled to receive the benefits. The learned Counsel also submitted that the Defendants 1 and 2 are not concerned with the other aspects -the disputes between the widows inter se. The learned Counsel also made an attempt to contend that in view of the remarriage of the plaintiff with D.W.5, the claim of the plaintiff/first wife cannot be sustained. 8. Sri Pramod representing Srinivas, the second wife and the children of Penchalaiah through the second wife, had advanced elaborate arguments drawing the attention of this Court to the scope, object and ambit of Section 16 of the Act and also had contended that in the light of the said provision it is clear that the children of the deceased Penchalaiah are entitled to their respective shares. The learned Counsel also pointed out that one of the children being no more, the mother - the second wife of Penchalaiah, is entitled to the said benefits and hence in any view of the matter, the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court do not suffer from any illegality warranting interference at the hands of this Court. 9. Heard the Counsel on record at length and also perused the oral and documentary evidence available on record. 10. The only controversy between the parties is the entitlement of the second wife to the benefits of the deceased Penchalaiah. The first wife had pleaded in the plaint as hereunder: 11. The marriage of the plaintiff with Penchalaiah was solemnized according to Hindu rites and customs about 15 years ago. But it was a bad affair for her because at the time of the marriage, her husband was unemployed and after marriage he got a job at the first instance in Postal Department. Securing this job had changed his life style and he began to neglect the plaintiff. The plaintiff was therefore compelled to file M.C.No. 1/85 for maintenance, During the pendency of the said case, the husband of the plaintiff got more handsome job in the Factory of the defendants. The Court was pleased to grant Rs. 350/- per mensum towards her alimony by recognising her as the neglected wife of her husband. The defendants as the employers have also sent the amounts for 18 months by deducting in the salary payable to the husband of the plaintiff. In or about 1990, the parents of the plaintiff approached her husband and requested him to take her into his society by burying the past.Nallagondla Kanthamma vs Nallagondala Rajyam And Ors. on 19 September, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/802256/ 2Though he did not express his willingness, the plaintiff went to him at Madras hoping that her destiny is with him only as a dutiful Indian wife. She soon found that her husband is having illicit intimacy with one married woman viz., Rajyam who was already big with four children through her husband. His world was Rajyam and his activity was only caressing her children being under her influence totally. The plaintiff was necked out by her husband. Finding no other way to sustain herself, the plaintiff was driven to the necessity of approaching the Court again for maintenance by filing M.C. No. 3/95 under Section 125 Cr.P.C. Her husband had successfully evaded to receive the notices sent by the Hon'ble Court and finally on 20-4-1996, he was set ex parte on substituted service and the plaintiff was awarded Rs. 500/- per month towards her living. Before the plaintiff would execute the decretal order, as the fate would have it, her husband passed away. She went along with her parents and got defaced apprising the defendants about the claim, which accrued on his death. The plaintiff submitted a representation to the defendants and they have acknowledged the same. Though they were satisfied about the status of the plaintiff as the legally wedded wife of late N. Penchalaiah, they wanted to get it by the declaratory suit. 12. The 2nd defendant and also the 3rd defendant filed their respective written statements wherein these parties had taken a stand that the deceased N. Penchalaiah was appointed in the Integral Coach Factory, Madras as III Machinist on 26-10-1987 and at the time of appointment the deceased employee had mentioned his wife's name as N. Rajyam and hence as per the particulars given by the deceased employee, these defendants had incorporated the name of Rajyam in the records and no where the deceased employee mentioned the name of his wife as N. Kanthammma. An admission was made that as per the records in Crl.M.P. No. 72/88, these defendants paid Rs. 367/- per month to the plaintiff towards her maintenance, but however, they are not aware of the proceedings M.C. No. 3/95. 13. The second wife/3rd defendant filed written statement with the following allegations: 14. It is true that Nallagondla Penchalaiah died on 19-6-1996 while working in the Factory managed by defendants 1 and 2. It is false to aver that the plaintiff is the wife of late Penchalaiah and that her marriage with him took place about 15 years back under Hindu rites and custom. It is further false to state that at the time of the alleged marriage, N. Penchalaiah was unemployed and later he got a job in the Postal Department. It is nothing but a tissue of falsehood to aver that after being employed in the Postal Department, N. Penchalaiah changed his life style and began to neglect the plaintiff. This defendant is not aware of the alleged proceedings in M.C.No. 1/85 and awarding of monthly maintenance of Rs. 350/-. It is false to state that in or about 1990 the parents of the plaintiff approached N. Penchalaiah and requested him to take her into his society. It is also denied that the plaintiff went to Madras and found that Penchalaiah was having illicit intimacy with this defendant. The entire narration is a cock and bull story invented for the purpose of this suit. It is submitted that this defendant in not aware of the alleged proceedings in M.C.No. 3/95, If really the plaintiff obtained bona fide Rs. 350/-towards maintenance in M.C. No. 1/85 there is no need for her to file again another M.C.No. 3/95 wherein Nattagondla Penchalaiah remained ex parte. It is false to state that the plaintiff went along with her parents and attended the funeral of N. Penchalaiah. It is only this defendant and her children who mourned the death of N. Penchalaiah and performed the funeral rites. The real facts are that the defendant is the only wife of late Penchalaiah.

Compendiously and concisely, the relevant facts absolutely necessary and germane for the disposal of these Civil Revision Petitions, would run thus: (i) The wife filed the H.M.O.P.No.82 of 2011, during the month of June' 2011, so to say, within a period of one year from the date of marriage, invoking Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, seeking the following reliefs: ""(a) granting a decree of divorce, dissolving the marriage solemnized between the Petitioner and Respondent on 18.11.2010; (b) directing the Respondent to pay the costs of this Petition;"" however, without filing an application to obtain the leave citing the exceptional circumstances. (ii) The husband after entering appearance, filed the application in I.A.No.184 of 2011 for rejection of the H.M.O.P.No.82 of 2011 on the main ground that it was presented within one year from the date of marriage and that too, without any application to obtain leave citing exceptional circumstances.

The learned Counsel for the husband would put forth and set forth his arguments, the warp and woof of the same, would run thus: Obtaining the leave of the Court is sine quo non for filing the H.M.O.P., for divorce within one year and it is mandatory and it cannot be simply ignored as directory. The object of Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, was not taken into consideration by the lower Court. If this sort of practice is allowed, then the sanctity attached to the marriages, would be set at naught. Over and above that, the reasons found stated for obtaining the said ex post facto leave is frivolous and there is nothing exceptional in it. The dowry demand is the pith and marrow of the alleged exceptional circumstances found set out in the affidavit accompanying the petition filed by the wife. Accordingly, the learned Counsel for the husband citing various precedents, would pray for allowing the I.A.No.184 of 2011 and for dismissal of H.M.O.P.No.82 of 2011. 9. Whereas in a bid to mince meat and torpedo and pulverise the arguments as put forth on the side of the husband, the learned Counsel for the wife, would pyramid his arguments, the pith and marrow of them would run thus: The entire reading of Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, would connote and denote, project and portray that the obtention of such leave was not mandatory. So far this case is concerned, it is not that wilfully the H.M.O.P.No.82 of 2011 was filed within one year without obtaining leave and unwittingly alone, the petition for divorce was filed without filing the application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, narrating the exceptional circumstances. As such, the lower Court taking into consideration the pro et contra, thought that it would be a mere waste of time to reject the H.M.O.P., and thereby paving the way for the wife to file a fresh petition for divorce on the same grounds. 10. The learned Counsel for the wife also cited various decisions in support of his arguments. 11. The points for consideration are: (i) Whether there is any illegality or perversity in the orders passed by the lower Court in allowing the I.A.No.26 of 2012 filed by the wife on the ground that there were exceptional circumstances involved in filing H.M.O.P.No.82 of 2011 for divorce within one year from the date of marriage? (ii) Whether there is any impropriety or illegality in the order of dismissal passed in I.A.No.184 of 2011 filed by the husband? Point Nos.(i) and (ii) 12.

No doubt, the issues haveKrishnakumari Thampuran vs The Palace Administration Board on 26 February, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6906/ 1become more perplexing due to the peculiar nature of the property involved, firstly by the fact that the personal law applicable to the members of the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family was the Marumakkathayam Rules of inheritance; secondly on account of the successive statutory interventions applicable to the system of Joint Hindu Family in the State as a whole, and sometimes applicable to the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family. We will recapitulate the bare essential facts necessary to understand the issues arising for consideration. W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 2 :: 2. The first appellant [now deceased], was a member of the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family. She married a Namboodiri and a male child was born in the wedlock. Later, during the lifetime of her husband and during the subsistence of the marriage, she entered into a relationship with a Muslim and begot two children, viz., appellants 2 and 3. 3. The claim, which is adjudicated in this appeal was one which was raised on behalf of appellants 2 and 3, who are the children of the first appellant, born to a Muslim. The claim was pursued qua a share in the properties which belong to the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family. It may noted, at the outset, that the claim raised by the first appellant, now deceased, as regards her share in the erstwhile Joint Hindu Family properties was entertained and satisfied, though the first appellant earlier had expressed a dissatisfaction regarding the quantum of the share allotted to her in this regard. As noted by the W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 3 :: learned single Judge, that claim was not pursued by the 1st appellant. 4. The statutes applicable to the properties in question regulating its division and succession are peculiar and it is necessary to refer to the law in question. Finding that the members in the erstwhile Cochin Royal Family, are quite numerous and also finding that the properties available were not, at the same time, getting enlarged, the then Ruler of Cochin Sri.Rama Varma promulgated a proclamation on IX/1124, corresponding to 29th June, 1949 in relation to the administration and management and conservation of the properties of the Valiamma Thampuram Kovilakom Estate and Palace Fund. Clause 2 (bb)(c) and 3(1) of the said proclamation are relevant and are, therefore, extracted hereunder: ""2(bb) 'family; means the marumakkathayam joint family consisting of the four main travazhies of the Ruler, of the former state of Cochin within the meaning of Clause (22) of Article 266 of the Constitution of India."" W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 4 ::        3(1)    The Estate and the Palace Fund shall vest in                a  Board    to  be    called ""The    Palace Administration Board"" and such Board shall administer the Estate and the Palace Fund subject to the provisions of this Proclamation.""Krishnakumari Thampuran vs The Palace Administration Board on 26 February, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6906/ 25. Clause 13 of the proclamation provided that the Board shall administer the properties and palace fund as carefully as an ordinary prudent man deals with his properties or fund. What is to be noted, insofar as the proclamation is concerned, is the vesting of the Estate and Palace Fund in the Palace Administration Board and the power available to the Board under Clause 21 thereof, extended to acquisition of movable and immovable properties and leasing out any movable property belonging to the estate. No other alienation could be effected by the Board. No other member of the family was considered to have any other right in relation to the property. W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 5 :: 6. It has to be noticed, at this juncture, that the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, when it was enacted specifically provided vide Section 5(iii) thereof that the Act shall not apply to the Estate and Palace Fund administered by the Board. 7. The next statutory intervention came in 1961 by virtue of the Valiamma Thampuram Kovilakom Estate and Palace Fund Act {hereinafter referred to as the ""VTK Act 16/61""}. Section 3 of the said Act enabled the Maharaja of Cochin to declare the decision to effect a partition under his supervision and control provided he is satisfied in that regard in the interest of the family. Under Section 4(1), each member shall be entitled to an equal share of the Estate and the Palace Fund and 'Member' means a member of the family of the Maharaja of Cochin {vide Section 2(d) of the Act}. Section 6 of the Act provided for the execution and registration of the deed of partition on behalf of all the members by the Maharaja of Cochin W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 6 :: and the members of the Board. Section 7 expressly bars the power to institute a suit for partition of the estate and the palace fund. Section 8 of the Act excluded the personal privileges of the Maharaja from the purview of the Act. Section 5(3) of the Act which shielded the Kovilakam Estate and Palace Fund from the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act was directed to be omitted with effect from the execution of the partition deed under Section 6 of the Act. The effect of 1961 Act was, therefore, to bring about a limited partibility of the Kovilakam Estate and Palace Fund. The restriction on partibility was relatable to Section 3 of the Act, which still made partition dependent on a decision to be taken by the Maharaja of Cochin in that regard. 8. In chronological order, the next statutory intervention came about by the Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, Act 30/76 {hereinafter referred to as the ""Abolition Act""}. Section 2(1) of the Abolition Act defined a W.A.No.1907 of 2006 :: 7 :: 'Joint Hindu Family' as to include a 'tarwad' or 'thavazhy' governed by the Cochin Marumakkathayam Act. Section 4 (2) of the Abolition Act is relevant in this context and it reads as follows: ""4(2) All members of a Joint Hindu Family, other than an undivided Hindu Family referred to in sub-section(1), holding any Joint Family property on the day this Act comes into force,s hall, with effect from that day be deemed to hold it as tenants-in-common, as if a partition of such property per capita had taken placeKrishnakumari Thampuran vs The Palace Administration Board on 26 February, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6906/ 3","['6', '4', '3', '5', '8', '2', '7']"

The learned Additional District Judge has allowed the petition for divorce by holding that the marriage between the parties stands dissolved subject to the condition that the respondent herein deposits an amount of Rs.2 Lacs towards permanent maintenance within six months from the date of judgment and decree. The respondent No.1 original plaintiff husband has filed this cross objection praying for quashing and setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned District Judge, Sabarkantha at Himmatnagar in Civil Appeal No.9 of 2005 in so far as and to the extent that it has awarded the amount of permanent alimony and maintenance of Rs.2 Lacs to the wife, and to direct that the amount already deposited by the husband be forthwith refunded to him. Initially, this Court vide its order dated 14.08.2008 dismissed this second appeal for want of prosecution. However, by an order dated 12.12.2008 passed in Civil Application No.13070 of 2008 condoned the delay and thereafter the order of even date passed in Misc. Civil Application (Stamp) No.3071 of 2008 restored the Second Appeal to its original file. Thereafter, this Court has issued notice in the Second Appeal on 13.03.2009 and decree of divorce was directed to be remained under suspension. The Second Appeal came to be admitted on 25.09.2009 and following substantial questions of law were framed by this Court for consideration and determination of this Court :- Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the First Appellate Court committed error in passing the impugned judgment on the ground of irretrievable break down of marriage ? Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the petition was not maintainable on account of non-joinder of necessary party? Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the First Appellate Court committed error in not following procedure prescribed under section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 ? After admission of the Second Appeal, the respondent husband has moved Civil Application N.5038 of 2010 for fixing early date of hearing on Second Appeal.

372,"Madras High Court Ranganathan vs Shymala on 5 November, 1988 Equivalent citations: (1989) 1 MLJ 323 Author: K Natarajan ORDER K.M. Natarajan, J. 1. C.R.P. No. 1324 of 1986-converted into C.M.S.A. No. 8 of 1988: in view of the order passed in C.M.P. No. 12496 of 1988 this petition is converted into C.M.S.A. and disposed of accordingly. The only substantial question of law arises in this appeal is whether the permanent alimony can be granted to a wife under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, even though the main petition for annulment of marriage under Section 12 of the Act is dismissed. 2. According to the learned Counsel for the appellant, Mr. M.N. Padmanabhan, that under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a permanent alimony can be granted only when in the petition filed by either of the spouse under Sections 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 of the Act, a decree is passed and not in cases where the petition is dismissed. According to the learned Counsel only in cases where the marriage relationship comes to an end or altered, a permanent alimony can be granted and not in cases where the relationship of the marriage is subsisting and the remedy of the spouse is to proceed under the Hindu adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 for the relief of maintenance and not under the Hindu Marriage Act. In support of his contention, the learned Counsel relied on various decisions reported in Shantaram Gopalshet Marar v. Hirabai I.L.R. 1962 Bom.27; Minarani Majumdar v. Dasarath Majumdar , Shantaram Dinakar Kamik v. Malti Shantaram Kamik , Akasam Chinnababu v. Akasam Parbati (D.B), Purshotam v. Devki , Gurucharan Kaur v. Ramchand , Darshan Singh v. Mst. Daso , Sushamma v. Satishchandra A.I.R.1984 Delhi.l and Vmod Chandra Sharma v. Rajesh Pathak A.I.R.1988 A11.150. The ratio laid down in the above said decisions is to the effect that in the context of Section 25 of the Act, the expression 'passing any decree' means any of the decrees provided for under Section 9 to 13 of the Act, and not the dismissal of a petition, But although technically speaking dismissal of a suit may be called a decree, such a decree is not contemplated under Section 25 of the Act. The learned Counsel appearing on either side frankly conceded that there is no judgment of this Court on this question. However, the learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that there is one decision of this Court under Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, reported in Devasakayam v. Devamony 43M.L.J. 763 : A.I.R.1923 Mad. 211 : 17 MLW 90, where it was held as follows: It is not competent to the Court dismissing a husband's petition for dissolution of marriage, to award maintenance to the wife, under Section 15 or 37 of the Indian Divorce Act. Though the wife might have filed an application for divorce or judicial separation on the husband's petition under Section 15 of the Act, still in the absence of a decree for dissolution of judicial separation, no order for maintenance can be made under the Act. To appreciate the aforesaid decision, it is worthwhile to quote the provisions of Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, which runs thus:Ranganathan vs Shymala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1156315/ 1The High Court may, if it thinks fit, on any decree absolute declaring a marriage to be dissolved, or any decree of judicial separation obtained by the wife, and the District Judge may, if he thinks fit, on the confirmation of any decree of this declaring a marriage to be dissolved or any decree of judicial separation obtained by the wife, order that the husband shall, to the satisfaction of the Court secure to the wife such gross sum of money or such annual sum of money for any term not exceeding her own life, as having regard to her fortune (if any) to the ability of the husband, and to the conduct of the parties, it thinks reasonable; and for that purpose may cause a proper instrument to be executed by all necessary parties. In every such case the court may make an order on the husband for payment to the wife or such monthly or weekly sums for her maintenance and support as the Court may think reasonable. Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows: (1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding to life of the applicant, as having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the Court to be just and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent. (2) If the Court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has made an order under Sub-section (1) it may at the instance of either party, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just. (3) If the Court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been made under this section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she has not remained chaste, or if such party is the husband, that he has had sexual intercourse with any woman outside wed-lock, it may at the instance of the other party vary, modify of rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just. This Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not identical to Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act. It is clear from Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, that only in a case where the Court on passing any decree absolute declaring a marriage to be dissolved, or any decree of judicial separation by the wife and on its confirmation, make an order on the husband for payment to the wife, the monthly or weekly maintenance. But, this is not the case in so far as Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is concerned. Hence, that section is not at all helpful in deciding the issue involved in this appeal. The very Section 37 itself contemplates passing of a decree for dissolution or a judicial separation for granting a permanent alimony to the wife. But Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act contemplates only passing of any decree and it does not further proceed to say a decree for either dissolution, nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights, or judicial separation.Ranganathan vs Shymala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1156315/ 23. It is clear from the above two provisions that what is contemplated under Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 is materially different from the language used by the Legislature under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and that the decision rendered in Darsan Singh v. Mst. Daso , cannot afford any guidance in construing the language used by the Legislature in Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. We are now concerned with the words at the passing of any decree or any time consequent thereto with regard to the grant of permanent alimony in favour of the defeated spouse"". In this connection, it is worth while to refer to the various decisions relied on by the learned Counsel for the appellant. In Akasam Chinna Babu v. Parbati A.I.R. 1967 Oris. 163(D.B) a Division Bench of the said Court relying on the earlier decisions reported in Harilal Purushotham v. Lilavathi Gokaldas , Shantaram Gopalshet v. Hirabai , Shantaram Dinakar v. Malti Shantaram Karnik , Minarani v. Dasarath , held that the expression 'any decree' means passing of any of the decrees mentioned in Sections 9 to 14 of the Act and it does not include an order of dismissal and further the passing of an order of dismissal is not the same thing as passing of a decree and that therefore it cannot be regarded as the passing of a decree and permanent alimony cannot be granted to a party while dismissing the petition under Act. In the decision reported in Smt., Sushama v. Satishchandra,. A.I.R.1984 Del. 1, a Division Bench of the said Court, while considering the earlier decisions held as follows: Hindu Marriage Act (25 of 1955) Section 25 Permanent alimony and maintenance-When can be granted words 'passing any decree' in Section 25, mean passing of decree of divorce, restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation. Alimony and maintenance cannot therefore be granted as passing of decree dismissing divorce petition. Permanent alimony and maintenance under Section 25 can only be granted in case divorce is granted and not if the marriage subsists. The word 'decree' is used in matrimonial cases in a special sense different from that in which it is used in Civil Procedure Code. The passing of the 'decree' in Section 25 means the passing of the decree of divorce, restitution of conjugal rights, or judicial separation and not the passing of a decree dismissing the petition. If the petition fails then no decree is passed, i.e, the decree is denied to the applicant. Alimony, cannot therefore, be granted in a case where a decree for a divorce or other decree is refused because in such a case the marriage subsists. The power to grant alimony contained in Section 25 can only be exercised when the court is faced with the problem of setting the mutual rights of the parties after the matrimonial ties have been determined or varied by the passing of the kind of decree mentioned to Sections 9,10,11 and 13 of the Act and not in other cases. Sections 23,26 and 27 also show that a decree is passed only when application for divorce or other relief is granted and not when the application is dismissed. The Division Bench has elaborately dealt with the reasoning in paragraphs 5 to 8 and ultimately came to the conclusion that the word 'decree' in a specific sense is different from that in which it is used in the Civil Procedure Code and that accounted for the reasons which have prompted the reference to the Bench for proper consideration of the term 'decree' used in the context under Section 22 of the Act. The learned Judges have also considered the word 'decree' used in SectionsRanganathan vs Shymala on 5 November, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1156315/ 3","['15', '22', '12', '9', '25']"

The appellant Harpreet Singh Sekhon has filed this appeal through his father and General Power of Attorney Dilraj Singh Sekhon against the judgment and decree dated 25.08.2010 passed by the learned District Judge, Family Court, Faridabad whereby the suit filed by the respondent-wife Rajwant Kaur Sekhon for declaring the ex parte judgment dated 23.05.2005 passed by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, United States of America (USA-for short) to be illegal has been decreed in her favour and the aforesaid divorce decree has been declared null and void and not binding on the rights of the plaintiff-respondent Rajwant Kaur Sekhon. The marriage between the plaintiff-respondent Smt. Rajwant Kaur Sekhon and the defendant-appellant-Harpreet Singh Sekhon was solemnized by way of Anand Karaj on 09.02.2000. The plaintiff alleged that her marriage was a decent marriage. Her parents, brothers and sisters spent about Rs.30,00,000/- on the marriage. A list of expenses on the dowry articles and the other expenses including ring ceremony expenses has been attached. The defendant-appellant along with his parents had been permanently residing in USA. They are green card holders of United States of America. The father of the defendant-appellant namely Dilraj Singh Sekhon Ex Joint Director of Central Bureau of Investigation after leaving his job in India settled permanently in USA. He was working as a lecturer at Columbia College, Chicago, USA. However, for the last about three years, he was living at Mohali in Punjab in his own house. He is owner of more than 70 'killas' (acres) of agricultural land in village Issawal, Ludhiana (Punjab). The plaintiff-respondent was residing atHarpreet Singh Sekhon vs Rajwant Kaur on 22 February, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172266062/ 1House No.645 Sector-16, Faridabad (Haryana). The said house is owned by the father of the defendant/appellant and is a Joint Hindu Family property. According to the plaintiff-respondent, the minor daughter of the parties namely Sirut (sic. Seerat) Sekhon through her mother and guardian Rajwant Kaur Sekhon (plaintiff- respondent) filed a suit against her father Harpreet Singh Sekhon (defendant/appellant), her grand parents namely Dilraj Singh Sekhon and Smt. Tejinder Kaur, her father's brother namely Sarabjit Singh Sekhon and paternal aunt namely Smt. Satnam Kaur inter alia claiming that she is also co-owner in possession in equal share of the residential House No.645 Sector-16, Faridabad; besides, co-owner in equal share of property in village Issawal, District Ludhiana (Punjab) and co-owner in residential House No.722 Phase-IX, near Cricket Stadium, Mohali. The said suit was pending in the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division), Faridabad at the time of filing of the present suit out of which the present appeal arises. On 24.02.2002, the plaintiff/respondent received a telephone message from Dilraj Singh Sekhon (father-in-law of the plaintiff), the husband of the plaintiff and her mother-in-law as also other family members namely Satnam Kaur and Pikky Aulakh. It is alleged that they were taunting her for bringing inadequate dowry. They were harassing her mentally and physically by beating her. First Information Report (FIR) for the offences under Sections 498-A and 406 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC-for short) was got registered in this regard at Police Station Central, Faridabad. After marriage, the plaintiff and defendant resided at Mohali, Ludhiana and village Issawal. The defendant-appellant then went to USA leaving the plaintiff at her parental house at Faridabad. There she had a daughter on 04.12.2000. The in-laws of the plaintiff did not cook food for three days as they did not want a female child. On 30.12.2000, the defendant came back to India and took the plaintiff with him to Mohali. The defendant, it is alleged, came to India from USA on several occasions, however, despite promising to take the plaintiff to USA, he never took her and each time he would say that he would take her next time. The plaintiff in this way felt that she was being made a fool of. Thereafter on 23.05.2005, the defendant obtained a decree of divorce from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinios Department-Domestic Relations Division. In terms of the said decree it is alleged that an ex parte and a fraudulent divorce decree was got passed in favour of the defendant. The said divorce decree being a foreign judgment it was prayed was liable to be set aside being not a valid decree in view of Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure (C.P.C-for short) and on other grounds as well. It was submitted that under the provision of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 only the District Courts within the local limits of whose ordinary civil jurisdiction (i) the marriage was solemnized, or (ii) the respondent, at the time of the presentation of the petition, resides, or (iii) the parties to the marriage last resided together, or (iv) the petitioner is residing at the time of the presentation of the petition, in a case where the respondent is, at that time, residing outside the territories to which this Act extends, or has not been heard of as being alive for a period of seven years or more by those persons who would naturally have heard of him if he were alive would have the jurisdiction to entertain and try the petition. Therefore, it was submitted that the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinos had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. According to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act under which the parties were admittedly married, irretrievable break down of marriage as a ground for dissolution of the marriage was not recognised. It was submitted that the defendant by way of filing the divorce petition in USA committed fraud and forged grounds, which were not available to him; besides, no valid ground mentioned in the divorce petition by the defendant was existing at the time of filing the divorce petition. The parties never resided in USA together and the plaintiff never refused to reside with the defendant in USA or in India. TheHarpreet Singh Sekhon vs Rajwant Kaur on 22 February, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172266062/ 2defendant does not provide or send from USA any kind of maintenance to the plaintiff and her daughter in India. The defendant and her family had been avoiding services in all Court cases which were pending at Faridabad. The plaintiff and her minor daughter were fully dependent on her parents. The plaintiff had also filed a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The defendant/appellant filed written statement through his father and General Power of Attorney (GPA) Dilraj Singh Sekhon. Preliminary objections were raised to the effect that the petition was time barred. The divorce judgment by the Court of Cook County Illinos, it is stated, was passed on 23.05.2005 and the petition to set aside the divorce judgment was filed on 15.04.2008. The case did not fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Faridabad Court. The marriage was solemnized at Jalandhar in Punjab. The plaintiff and defendant had lived together as husband and wife in H.No.722, Phase-9, Mohali. They had never lived in House No.645 Sector-16, Faridaband. The said house was occupied by a tenant. The divorce granted by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinios was a valid divorce. On receipt of notice from the said Court, it is stated that the plaintiff had filed her appearance voluntarily through her attorney. By filing her appearance, she had submitted to the jurisdiction of the said Court. By filing reply to the same she had contested the case in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinios. It is stated that the defendant Harpreet Singh Sekhon could not file divorce petition in India because he was not a domicile of India. He has been a domicile and permanent resident of USA. A reference was made to the case of Dr. David Chakravarthy Arunmainayagan vs. Geetha Chakravarthy Arunmainayagan 2002 (1) Marriage Law Journal 254 (Madras) wherein in the context of the Divorce Act, 1869, it is stated that the parties to marriage should be domiciled in India which is a condition precedent under Section 2 of the Divorce Act to file a petition. It is further stated that the list relating to expenditure on dowry articles was false and baseless. It was a simple and dowry less marriage. The dowry articles such as furniture, TV, Refrigerator and other such items were not required to be taken to USA where non-resident Indians (NRIs) live. On 11.06.2002, the plaintiff and her father Sarwan Singh Nijjar got the marriage registered with the Registrar of Marriages, Jalandhar-I, Punjab when Harpreet Singh Sekhon defendant was living in USA. This fraudulent registration of marriage was being investigated by the Deputy Commissioner, Jalandhar and the Punjab Police, Jalandhar. The plaintiff it is stated is not residing in House No.645 Sector-16, Faridabad. The said house was in forcible possession of her brother Jagjit Singh who had taken its possession after breaking open the lock of the house with the help of his relative. On 06.07.2005, case FIR No.252 had been registered at Central Police Station, Faridabad for the offence under Section 448 of the IPC. The plaintiff had never lived in the said house. She lived in her parental house i.e. H.No.2382 Sector-9, Faridabad. She reaches that house whenever Investigating Officer goes there. The said house is a self-acquired property of Harpreet Singh Sekhon who had constructed the house to live in it after retirement from the Central Government. Baby Sirut (sic. Seerat) Sekhon minor it is stated was being misused by the plaintiff and her relative to grab the property. No Court had declared the plaintiff as her guardian. Harpreet Singh Sekhon defendant had filed a case for custody of Baby Sirut (Seerat) Sekhon. On 30.11.2005, the Additional District Judge, Faridabad had vacated the stay granted by the lower Court. Thereafter the High Court had granted interim stay in this case.

Petitioner in H.M.O.P.No. 64 of 1992 on the file of Subordinate Judge, Tenkasi is the appellant. She filed the said petition before the sub Court under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for restitution of conjugal rights. On the basis of oral and documentary evidence and after holding that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was performed on 27.7.83 according to Hindu rites and customs and she gave birth to a child on 13.10.83, allowed the said petition. Aggrieved by the said order the respondent-husband filed appeal in District Court. Tirunelveli. The lower appellate court set aside the order of the trial court and allowed the appeal, against which the wife has filed the present second appeal before this Court under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 100, C.P.C. 2. The case of the appellant is briefly stated, hereunder:- According to her, she is the wife of the respondent herein. Both of them belong to Kulasekaramangalam village. Sankaran Koil Taluk. Prior to their marriage, they lived in the same street. From 1981 to 1983 they loved each other and because of cohabitation she conceived in the month of February, 1983. After prolonged request and after complaint to the police, the marriage was performed between them on 27.7.83 at Pillayar temple in the presence of Village Headman and others. It is further stated that after the marriage, they lived together some time in Kulasekaramangalam, where she gave, birth to a male child on 13.10.83. However, the respondent failed to take care of her and even her child. He also demanded Rs.10,000 as well as 10 sovereign of gold as dowry, In such a circumstance, having no other option has filed the petition for restitution of conjugal rights. The same was resisted by the respondent-husband by way of filing counter statement wherein he denied the relationship between himself and the wife as well as the marriage which is said to have taken place on 27.7.83. He denied all the averments made by the petitioner. He also emphatically denied that the child was not born to him and no marriage took place as claimed. 3. Before the trial court, apart from the oral evidence of P.W.1, the Village Headman in whose presence the marriage was performed, was examined as P.W.2 and the Inspector of Police-one Sakthidasan was examined as P.W.3. Village Account Book was marked as Ex.P-1 through P.W.2. The respondent got himself examined as R.W.1 and he also examined one Jones as R.W.2. apart from marking Exs. R-1 to R-8. As stated earlier, though the trial court accepted the case of the petitioner and passed/granting relief under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the lower appellate court dismissed the said petition by allowing the appeal filed by the husband. 4. While admitting the above second appeal on 3.1.1997, this Court has framed the following substantial questions of law:- (1) Whether the lower appellate Court erred in law and misdirected itself in holding that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was not established merely because theAnnathai vs Murugaiah on 31 March, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1106413/ 1marriage was not registered when there is no State enactment which provide for compulsory registration as provided under Section 8(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955? (2) Whether the lower appellate Court erred in law and misdirected itself In holding that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was not proved though the petitioner has established the factum of marriage as provided under Section 7A (c) of the Hindu Marriage (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act. 1967"" 5. It is the definite case of the appellant that while herself and the respondent herein were living in the same street during 1981 and 1983. They loved each other and because of their close intimacy even before marriage, she became pregnant. It is also her definite case that after persuasion and after making a complaint to the police, the marriage between her and the respondent took place on 27.7.83 at Pillayar temple in the presence of the village Headman. In the petition the appellant herein has specifically pleaded all the above aspects in detail. In her evidence as P.W.1, she deposed thus:- Even in the cross-examination, she asserted and affirmed what she had stated in the chief-examination Apart from the evidence of P.W.1, the village Headman- Veliah was examined as P.W.2. He also deposed that, He also deposed with regard to the entries made in the Account Book. The said Account Book has beer marked as Ex, P-1. The Inspector of Police was examined as P.W.3. Even if we eschew in the evidence P.W.3 regarding the marriage, we have the evidence of P.Ws.l and 2. On the other hand, the husband was examined as R.W.1, No doubt, he denied the statements made by P.Ws.l and 2. The other witness examined on the side of the husband is R.W.2. It was he who recorded her statement when she made a complaint to the Legal Aid Centre. In order to show that the petitioner had furnished different dates regarding her male child. R.W.2 was examined. He is nothing to do with the marriage, hence it is unneccssary to consider his evidence. 6. The evidence of P.Ws.l and 2 are more probable and acceptable. Even though it is stated by R.W.1 that there was no marriage at all on 27.7.83, it is clear that marriage between him and the petitioner-wife was performed on that date at Pillayar Koil in the presence of many persons including the Village Headman, P.W.2. Both P.Ws.l and 2 deposed that '""thali"" was tide by the respondent-husband in the presence of P.W.2 and others and thereafter they exchanged garlands. Hence, it is clear that they fulfilled the conditions prescribed under Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act. No doubt, the appellate Court after holding that in the absence of any registration of the marriage and in view of different dates regarding the birth of the male child disagreed with the finding of the trial court, allowed the appeal and dismissed the petition filed by the wife. 7. First I shall consider whether there was any marriage on 27.7.83 between the appellant and the respondent and whether the same was proved by the wife? 8. As per Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a Hindu marriage can be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto, section 7-A recognises' suyamariyathai' and 'seerthiruththa' marriages. The special provision recognises the marriage by each party declaring in any language understood by them that each takes the other to be his wife or,Annathai vs Murugaiah on 31 March, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1106413/ 2as the case may be, her husband, or garlanding each other or putting a ring upon any finger of the other, or by tying of the thali. It is clear that all marriages fulfilling any of these conditions are valid in law. In the case of Mathialaqan. K. v. Mala Devi, 1989 (2) L.W. 361 Srinivasan, J., (as he then was) has held that, ""...There was tying of thali and exchange of garlands. As laid down by Maheswaran, J. in Koodappan v. Kothai Nachirammal, 1979 L.W. (Crl.) 154, such a marriage is valid in view of the Hindu Marriage Act. as amended by Tamil Nadu Act 21 of 1967..."" In Kailasam and others v. Alagammal, 1987 L.W. (Crl.) 156. Padmini Jesudurai, J., has held as follows:- ""...Sec.7A of the Madras Act 21 of 1967 indicates three kinds of valid marriage and Sec.7A (1) (c) include marriage by mere tying of the thali. It is, therefore, clear that tying of the thali without any other ceremony could be a valid marriage. Under Sec.7A (2) (a) it is not necessary that tying of thali should also be accompanied by exchange of garlands. The various sub clauses of Sec.7A (2) are disjunctive. It is also not necessary that there should be any evidence that the marriage was performed as Suyamariyathai or Seerthirutha marriage. It has been so laid down by Maheswaran. J., in Koodappan v. Kothai, 1979 L.W. (Crl.) 154 : 1980 M.L.J.(Crl.) 420. I respectfully concur with the view of the learned Judge. Substantial Justice has been done and requiring illiterate persons to state during evidence technicalities touching upon fact aspects of kinds of marriage would negative justice. In the instant case, there is evidence that thali was tied, as required under Section 6A (1) (c) of the Madras Act 21 of 1967. The prosecution, therefore, has established that the marriage between the petitioners 1 and 2 also a valid marriage as required under Sec. 494, I.P.C."" In Indirani v. Vellathal, 1988 (1) L.W. 358. the Division Bench of this Court (Sathiadev and Sivasubramaniam, JJ.) have held that ""exchange of garlands or putting a ring or tying a thali etc., are traditionally recognised stages of a marriage ceremony, which brings into existence a binding valid marriage."" I have already stated that the wife has specifically narrated and pleaded all the events in her petition and she got herself examined as P.W.1. P.W.2, a respectable Village Headman, corroborated the evidence of P.W.1 in all aspects including performance of the marriage on 27.7.83 between the petitioner and respondent at Pillayar temple in the presence of their relatives. He also deposed that a thali was tied by the bride-groom and they exchanged garlands. Even R.W.1, the husband has admitted that both of them belong to the same community and they lived in the same street. Merely because the complaint said to have been made to the police was not brought to the court, there is no reason to dis-believe the version of P.Ws.l and 2. The lower appellate Court has opined that due to missing of certain pages in Ex.P-1 and the non-examination of other relatives as witnesses, the case of the petitioner cannot be accepted. I am of the view that the evidence let in on the side of the petitioner is sufficient to hold that the marriage between appellant and respondent was performed on 27.7.83 and the non-availability of certain pages in Ex.P-1 Account Book containing the details as to the marriage between them and gifts offered by several persons will not affect the case of the petitioner. The lower appellate court committed an error in taking a contrary view and rejecting the acceptable evidence placed by the petitioner. 9. Coming to the point with regard to birth of a male child to the appellant in the wed-lock, the lower appellate Court came to the conclusion that the child was not born to them.

This petition, at the instance of the husband, is directed against the order dated 8th November, 1988 passed by the Family Court, Gorakhpur allowing the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 of Smt. Gyani Devi, respondent No. 2 (wife) whereby a sum of Rs. 500/- as litigation expenses and Rs. 200/- per month as maintenance allowance has been awarded to the wife. 2. Sometimes in March, 1987 the petitioner instituted Suit in the Court of Civil Judge, Gorakhpur under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act claiming a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Upon the constitution of the Family Court, the suit was transferred to that Court. The petitioner contested the application made by his wife under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act by filing a reply to it. 3. The only submission made on behalf of the petitioner is that, as envisaged in Section 9 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), it was the duty of the Court to first make effort for bringing about a settlement between the parties before passing the impugned order and it having failed to do so it acted without jurisdiction. The contention is to be rejected, as stated. 4. Section 7 of the Act lays down that subject to the other provisions of the Act the Family Court shall have and exercise all the jurisdiction exercisable by any district Court or any subordinate civil Courts under any -law for the time being in force in respect of suits and proceedings of the nature referred to in the Explanation. It also provides that the Family Court shall be deemed, for the purposes of exercising such jurisdiction under such law, to be a directed Court or, as the case may be, such subordinate civil Court for the area to which the jurisdiction of the Family Court extends. In the Explanation there is a long list of suits and proceedings begining from (a) and ending on (g). Explanation (a) includes a suit or proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights. Section 8 of the Act excludes the jurisdiction of district Court or any subordinate civil Court in respect of any suit or proceedings of the nature referred to in the Explanation aforesaid and provides that any such suit or proceeding shall stand transferred to the Family Court. 5. The Act has not abrogated the Hindu Marrige Act on the contrary, Section 7 makes it clear that the Family Court is clothed with all the powers and the jurisdiction which any district Court or any subordinate Court exercises under the Hindu Marriage Act. It is apparent that a suit or proceedings for restitutiton of conjugal rights, as contemplated in Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, are now cognizable only by the Family Courts. The district Court and Courts subordinate thereto have been divested of that jurisdiction. Putting it differently, the Hindu Marriage Act as a whole will now be administered by the Family Court. It goes without saying that Section 24 of that Act forms part of the Hindu Marriage Act.Ram Bachan vs Family Court Judge And Ors. on 13 August, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1519234/ 16. Sections 23 and 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act have been placed side by the legislature sub-Section (2) of Section 23 posits that before proceeding to grant any relief under the Hindu Marriage Act. It shall be the duty of the Court, at the first instance, in every case where it is possible to do so consistently with the nature and circumstances of the case, to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties. Section 24 provides that where in any proceeding under, the Hindu Marriage Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceedings, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it seems to the Court reasonable. 7. Section 24 is for the benefit of the husband and the wife. The object of the Section is to enable the husband or the wife, as the case may be, who has no independent income, to provide the other so that the proceeding may be conducted, or he or she may be maintained during the pendency of the proceeding. The intent of the legislature appears to be that either of the spouse may not be handicapped during the proceeding. Poverty of either spouse should not be allowed to act to their deteriment. 8. The legislative policy appears to be that financial assistance should be provided to the indigent spouse to maintain herself, or himself, as the case may, during the pendency of the proceeding and he or she should also have sufficient funds to defend or carry on proceeding so that the spouse does not unduly suffer In the conduct of the case for want of funds. Thus in Section 24 these are twin objects. The first is that either of the spouse should be able to maintain herself or himself and the second is that either of the spouse should possess sufficient funds to either prosecure the proceedings or to defend himself or herself in the proceedings. 9. In sub-Section (2) of Section 23 the opening words are ""before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act."" These words are clearly referable to reliefs is granted under that provision. The relief which are recognised under the Act. Under Section 24 an interlocutory order is passed. No relief recognised under the Act, are enumerated, namely, divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights. Therefore, the position is that sub-Section (2) of Section 23 is not attracted when an application under Section 24 by either spouse is considered and disposed of on merits. 10. In Dilipbhai Chhaganlal Patel v. State of Maharashira, (A.I.R. 1983 Bombay, 128) the argument is that the provisions of sub-Sections (2) and (3) of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act being mandatory, the Court will act without jurisdiction if, without taking recourse to those proceedings, it proceeds under Section 24 and grants reliefs there under. The learned Single Judge while repelling the contention has emphasised that the nature of the proceedings under Section 24 are summary in nature. No appeal is provided for against an order passed under Section 24. The object behind Section 24 is twofold, firstly to prevent vagrancy resulting from the strained relationship between the husband and wife and secondly to ensure that the indigent litigating spouse is not handicapped in defending or prosecuting the case for want of money. That is why Courts have always insisted that whenever an application is made under Section 24 it must be disposed of before any further stepsRam Bachan vs Family Court Judge And Ors. on 13 August, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1519234/ 2are taken in the main case. In a given case, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case an attempt to bring about a reconciliation might become difficult, if not impossible, unless some provision is made for maintenance and expenses, such a provision might become necessary even for an active participation in such a proceeding by the concerned spouse. The words used in sub-Section (2) of Section 23 i.e. ""before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act"" will not cover the summary proceedings under Section 24. 11. It is true, that, in the Act, there is prohibition against the appearance of lawyers in proceedings under it. Nonetheless, legal assistance would be required by cither of the spouse. We should not be oblivious of the fact that even now, in the Hindu society, the majority of the womenfolk are illiterate and simpleton. They, therefore, on their own can not either initiate or defend the proceedings. Legal assistance to them is indispensible. They Will have therefore, no alternative but to consult some lawyer. For doing so, they will need funds. Even in reconciliation proceeding an attempt by the Court to bring about a settlement between the parties will have a better chance of success, if the area of the discord or dispute between the spouses is narrowed down or minimised. It will be easier for the Court to pin-point the cause of the matrimonial unhappiness if the parties before it state their respective cases in a logical and clear manner. This may be possible if the pleadings of the parties are skilfully drafted. 12. Section 9 of the Act may now be read : ""In every suit or proceeding, endeavour shall be made by the Family Court in the first instance, where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case, to assist and persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding and for this purpose a Family Court may, subject to any rules made by the High Court, follow such procedure as it may deem fit."" 13. I find no real difference between the objects as contained in sub-Section (2) of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 9. The Act by itself does not provide for any suit or proceeding. The suit or proceedings, as already explained, are referred to in Explanation to Section 7. Those suits and proceedings are recognised under different statues, one of them being the Hindu Marriage Act. Therefore, sub-Section (2) of Section 23 has not been abrogated or repealed by Section 9. It follows that Section 9 has brought about no change in the legal position that the provisions as contained in sub' Section (2) of Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act do not control the proceedings under Section 24 of that Act. Again, the draftman, in Section 9, has taken care to emphasise that an endeavour to bring about a settlement between the parties should be made where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case. It is not intended in Section 9 that even though an indigent spouse can not either maintain himself or herself or prosecute or defend the litigation in which she or he is involved yet the Court should persuade him or her to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceedings. 14. We may now consider Section 20 of the Act which provides that the provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other then the Act.

The instant appeal has been preferred by the appellant wife against the Judgment and decree dated 12.9.89 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 14th Court, Alipore thereby dismissing her matrimonial suit No. 39 of 1992 wherein she prayed for a decree of divorce against the husband respondent under the provisions of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act on grounds of cruelty, both mental and physical and desertion. The husband respondent contested the above suit in the Trial Court denying all the material allegation contained in the petition for divorce and his specific case was that the appellant wife sometime after her marriage developed illicit and adulterous relationship with one Sibapada Banerjee the husband of the respondent's elder sister which became a public scandal injuring the social position of the respondent and the members of his family but the petitioner wife i.e. the present appellant did not mend her ways and on her own consent the respondent took him to her father's jpise at Baranagar on 26th August, 1979 for spending a few days there. Since then the petitioner has not come back to her matrimonial home. According to the appellant she was neglected in her matrimonial home since her marriage where she had to perform only the household duties and that the inmates of the house never treated her well with dignity and even her own brother was not allowed to enter into the house when he came to see her at one occasion. It is the case of the appellant by way of subsequent amendment of the plaint that on 25:8.79 she was mercilessly assaulted by the husband who drove her out of his house for which she had to leave her matrimonial home with her daughter in single clothing leaving everything behind. It is the case of wife that the husband respondent and his family members had challenged her chastity, undermined her status, forcing her to cook and attend the household duties only and she was never allowed to participate in any family discussion or gathering. It is her case that she was even compelled to entertain the clients of her husband who happened to be a business man. She was even accused by the husband and his family members that her parents used to come not to see her but to collect money which she had stolen from her husband to help her parents. When she protested she was maltreated, abused and assaulted with blows and slaps given by the husband. Another objection was taken before the Trial Court by the husband/respondent that the matrimonial suit was not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act as their marriage was solemnised and registered under Special Marriage Act. It is to be considered by us whether the learned Trial Judge has rightly dismissed the petitioner's suit for divorce filed under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. At the outset it may be pointed out that the husband/respondent after the appeal was heard in part appeared and prayed for permission to contest the appeal which was allowed by us by our order dated 26.2.96. It is also interesting to note that on 4.3.96 the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent that Shri, Chowdhury learned Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that his client did not want to contest the appeal and as such Shri Chowdhury sought for our permission to retire. In support of his submission Shri Chowdhury filed a letter dated 3.3.96 written by theSm. Nandita Roy (Nee Ghosh) vs Sri Asish Kumar Roy on 2 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39938/ 1husband respondent to him staging that he was not required to represent him before the Court at the time of bearing of the appeal and that he did not want to contest the same. Under the circumstances Shri Chowdhury was permitted to retire and the appeal was ultimately heard exparte. 3. The learned Trial Judge on consideration of the evidence on record has come to a finding that the suit is not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is his finding that the marriage was solemnised and registered under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act and as such the suit was not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. Although the learned Trial Judge has found the suit to be not maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, he has decided the suit on merit and has dismissed the same on consideration of the other Issues relating to cruelty, desertion and adultery. Coming to his finding regarding the maintainability of the suit under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act we are of opinion that the said finding is erroneous and not sustainable in law in view of the cogent evidence on record. Admittedly the marriage was solemnised between the parties on 28.5.70 at 7 A.M. in the paternal house of the appellant at Baranagar in the evening. Admittedly both the appellant and the respondent belong to Brhamo Sect. Under Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act the said Act applies inter alia to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms of development, including a Virashaiva, a Linguyait or a follower of the Brahmo, Parthana or Aryasamaj. Under Section 2(3) of the said Act the expression 'Hindu' in any portion of the Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in the section. It would also be relevant at this point to refer to the Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) regarding the ceremonies for Hindu Marriage which is quoted below:- ""Ceremonies for a Hindu Marriage-(l) A Hindu Marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto. (2) Where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi (that is, the taking or sevan steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken"". 4. It is clear that the Act applies to the followers of Brahmo Samaj who may not be practising all the formalities of Hindu religion and in whose marriage retual ceremonies including Saptapadi as practised in others form of Hindu marriage are not necessary to make the marriage complete and legal. It is the case of the appellant that the marriage between the parties was solemnised under Brahmo rites and it was only registered under the Special Marriage Act on the same day after the marriage in Brahmo form was complete. It is her categorical evidence that all the ceremonies associated with Brahmo marriage, such as prayer by Acharya, devotional songs, exchange of garlands and rings and putting of vermilion mark on the forehead of the bride all took place with due solemnity, in presence of all the family members of both the parties. It is her evidence that one Nanibhusan Dasgupta presided over the marriage as Acharya who has since died. It is also her evidence that she signed all the papers in respect of the registration of the marriage under that Special Marriage Act after the Brahmo ceremonial marriage was over. D.W. 1 is the respondent husband. He states in his chief that after the Brahmo ceremony both he and the appellant signed theSm. Nandita Roy (Nee Ghosh) vs Sri Asish Kumar Roy on 2 May, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39938/ 2register before the Marriage Registrar and that their witnesses also signed. In cross-examination the husband has admitted that for the Brahmo ceremony marriage both the parties had mutual consent and that at the time of Brahmo ceremony marriage the parents of the both the parties were present. It is also gathered from the evidence that the Marriage Registrar under the Special Marriage Act was one Prasad Roy who is the brother of the Husband/respondent. 5. The said Prasad Roy has not however, been examined by the husband/respondent. Ext. C is the certificate of marriage issued under Section 13 of the Special Marriage Act dated 28.5.70 and there are three witnesses. But none of them has been examined by the respondent to show that the marriage registered under Ext. C was solemnised under the provisions of the said Act and not under Brahmo rites. The learned Trial Judge has disbelieved the story of Brahmo ceremonial marriage between the parties on the ground that the petitioner has not been corroborated by any other witness. But it appears that the appellant has examined one Prasanta Kumar Bhattacharjee P.W. 3 who is a co-tenant in the premises where the father and other family members of the petitioner resided at Baranagar. It is his evidence that he was a witness to the marriage between the parties which was solemnised there according to Brahmo custom. He further says that the ceremonial marriage was held prior to registration and that the marriage took place on 28.5.70. There is no reason to disbelieve this witness and the learned Trial Judge has unduly ignored the above evidence on record. There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the appellant and his witness P.W.3 in this regard. Accordingly we hold that the marriage between the parties were held and solemnised in Brahmo form on 28.5.70 as alleged by the appellant. Such a marriage could be registered under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act. But ext. C purports to suggests that the marriage was solemnised and registered under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. There cannot be two valid marriages between the same parties. It is clear from the evidence on record that the marriage between the parties was solemnised for the first time under Brahmo form. In that view of the matter the marriage certificate given under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act is redundant and should be ignored. If at all it is to be felled upon it should be treated as registration of the Brahmo marriage under Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act. Accordingly we hold that the appellants matrimonial suit brought against the husband/respondent for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is quite maintainable in form and in law. 6. Now we come to the merits of the case. The appellant has brought the suit for dissolution of her marriage by decree of divorce on ground of cruelty both mental and physical inflicted by the husband upon her and also on ground of desertion stating that she was driven out from her matrimonial home after being assaulted on 25.8.79. On subsequent amendment of the plaint it has been further stated by the petitioner that the husband along with the family members challenged her chastity and drove her out of matrimonial home on 25.8.79. The instances of cruelty as given in the plant have already been referred to us in the foregoing paragraphs of our judgment. The husband in his written statement and in his additional written statement has denied the entire story of cruelty and desertion. On the other hand in his written statement he has categorical, stated that his wife has undue, illicit and adulterous relationship with his brother-in-law one Sibapada Banerjee. It is his categorical case that the appellant's adulterous relationship with him became a family and public scandal and that the wife being requested not to indulge in such conduct left the matrimonial home on her own accord on 26th August, 1979 for her father's house where she hasSm.

Seth, J. 1. Mr. V. Singh. learned counsel for the petitioner in this writ petition, has raised a very Interesting question of law. According to him. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not postulate grant of maintenance to any person other than the wife of the husband. According to him, the very scheme of the Section indicates that the maintenance is available either to the wife or to the husband, as the case may be. according to the provisions contained therein. This cannot be stretched to grant maintenance in a proceeding under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act to the children. 2. Secondly, he contended that the provision of Section 24 cannot be referred to for the purposes of obtaining maintenance for the mother-in-law of the respondent wife on an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to him by no stretch of imagination, mother of the husband could be brought under the purview of Section 24 of the said Act filed by the wife for the purposes of grant of maintenance. 3. For the purpose of deciding the issue, it is necessary to mention the following facts giving rise to the present writ petition- The petitioner-husband filed O.S. No. 60 of 1995. under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act against the opposite party No. 3. wife, for divorce before the Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), II, Bijnor. In connection with the said proceedings, the wife had filed an application under Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act claiming maintenance for herself and two minor children aged about 3-1/2 years and 6 years and ailing mother of the husband on the ground that she is looking after the mother of the husband and spending around Rs. 1.200 per month on account of her treatment. This application was allowed by an order dated 25th January, 1997 in Misc. Case No. 44 of 1996. 4. The said order dated 25th January. 1997 was challenged by means of appeal being Misc, Appeal No. 26 of 1997. By an order dated 30th May, 1997 the Additional District Judge. VIIIth Court. Bijnor, had dismissed the said appeal and the order of learned Additional Civil Judge, Senior Division II passed on 25th January, 1997 was affirmed. These two orders are being challenged in this writ petition. 5. A reading of the order passed by the learned Civil Judge. Senior Division shows that the maintenance of sum of Rs. 3,000 was granted along with cost of litigation of Rs. 1,500 for the maintenance of the wife, two children and her mother-in-law. The appellate court had affirmed the said order which included the maintenance of mother of the husband. 6. The wife had alleged that the husband has been working in the Police Department and drawing a salary of Rs. 4.200 per month and he is also owner of a Maruti Car No. DL 2-C 3108 which is operated as Taxi by the husband by which he earns about Rs. 7.000-8.000 per month therefrom.Amit Kumar Sharma vs Vithe Additional District And ... on 8 May, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1202417/ 1She also alleges that the husband is also owner of a truck from which he earns about Rs. 17.000-18,000 per month. Thus he earns more than Rs. 21,000 per month. On these allegations the Courts had come to the finding that a sum of Rs. 3,000 should be granted as maintenance. Both the Courts have found that the husband did not disclose his own income and did not controvert the allegations made by the wife. 7. [ have heard Shrl Slngh at length and have also heard Sri V. K. Rai brief-holder appearing for the learned standing counsel who assisted the Court since this matter involves questions of law. 8. Learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. Singh did not dispute the finding by both the Courts that the husband did not disclose his income nor, had disputed the factual allegations made by the wife in the application under Section 24 of the said Act. However, he has insisted on legal proposition as indicated above. 9. Mr. Singh also contended that no application under Section 25 could be maintained and no order under Section 25 could be made during the pendency of the proceedings. Such order can only be made at the time of passing the decree. Therefore, according to him, the Courts below could neither invoke the provisions of Section 25 nor the wife could file the application under Section 25. 10. Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act clearly lays down that the Jurisdiction under Section 25 can be exercised ""at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto"". The very expression referred to above indicates that no application under Section 25 could be decided except at the time of passing of the decree. However, this section does not make the provision attracted during the pendency of the proceedings but the Court assumes jurisdiction to decide such application only at the time of passing of the decree. The Court may exercise its jurisdiction even after the decree is passed if such an application is made for such purposes either by the wife or by the husband. Therefore, Section 25 can be Invoked only at the time of passing the decree or thereafter. 11. Now the application which was described as an application under Section 24 and Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act can very well be treated to be .under Section 24 till the time of passing the decree and so far as the claim made in the said application with regard to Section 25 is concerned, the same can be determined at the time of passing the decree. The said application can be segregated into two phases. Inasmuch as before the decree is passed. It is not necessary that an application has to be made before the Court for such purpose though it is mandatory that such an application is to be made after the decree is passed. But then it is not necessary to go into this question. Still it is open to the wife to make such application even before the decree is passed and which may be decided accordingly. Therefore, it is not necessary to go into the question at this stage whether the disposal of the application under Section 24 and Section 25 of the said Act could prevent the petitioner's wife from making such an application, since the Court has no jurisdiction to decide such an application except at the time of passing the decree. In that event, the dismissal of such an application cannot affect the question of Section 25 that might crop up at the time of passing the decree. Thus scope of Section 25 is still open to the wife if she is so advised.Amit Kumar Sharma vs Vithe Additional District And ... on 8 May, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1202417/ 212. It is a settled principle of law that any description of the petition does not determine the character of the petition. It is the content and the substance and the relief sought will determine the character of an application. In this case wife had prayed for maintenance during the pendency of proceedings for herself, minor children and her mother-in-law (mother of the husband). Therefore, the Court did not commit any illegality in deciding the said application as an application under Section 24 of the said Act and treating the same as such. 13. Now the question whether the mother can be brought into the purview of Section 24 of the said Act may be taken up first. Section 24 provides as follows : ""Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner, the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable."" 14. A plain reading of the Section shows that it contemplates maintenance either to the wife or to the husband. It does not include maintenance either for the children or the mother of the husband. Whether the children would be entitled or not would be examined later on. At the moment, it is clear from Section 24 that the provisions thereof apply for the purpose of securing maintenance to the wife or the husband. The maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act is available to the parties to the proceedings with regard to the lis involved. The lis is confined to the extent of marriage between the wife and the husband. There cannot be any lis for the mother in respect of the proceedings between the husband and wife Involving their marriage. The mother is in no way connected with the lis relating to the marriage between the husband and the wife and, therefore, the provisions of Section 24 can never be stretched to include the maintenance of the mother in a proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 15. Admittedly Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is available to the parents against a neglecting child. Thus a mother can enforce her right of maintenance through Section 125, Cr. P.C. She is also entitled for maintenance through Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, which also provides a right to the parent to recover maintenance from neglecting children. Both Sections 125. Cr. P.C. and Section 20 Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act are regarding maintenance of parents by neglecting children. There is an alternative remedy available, the Hindu Marriage Act being non-applicable in respect of securing such maintenance by parent, the maintenance of the mother-in-law (mother of the husband) cannot be brought under the purview of the Section 24 of the said Act. 16. However, Mr. P. K. Rai tried to stretch the meaning of Section 24 by seeking to make out a point that the maintenance of the wife would Include the maintenance for the mother-in-law on the ground that they are living together, the wife cannot allow the mother-in-law to starve while feedingAmit Kumar Sharma vs Vithe Additional District And ... on 8 May, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1202417/ 3","['20', '13', '24', '12','25']"

This first appeal is filed under Section 96 of the CPC by the defendants 1 to 3 in O.S. No. 131 of 1988 on the file of the learned Principal Civil Judge, Mandya, decreeing the suit filed by the plaintiff/1st respondent. The parties will be referred to as plaintiff and defendants in the course of this judgment. 2. The plaintiff sought for partition and separate possession of his share in the suit schedule properties contending that his father late Nanjegowda had three wives namely the 1st defendant-Chikkamma, the late Kempamma and the mother of the plaintiff Boramma who is the 5th defendant in the suit. The defendants 2 and 3 are the daughters of Nanjegowda through the 1st defendant-Chikkamma. The defendant 4-Bhagyamma is the daughter of late Nanjegowda through his second wife the late Kempamma and defendant 6 is the sister of the plaintiff and daughter of the 5th defendant. It is stated that the plaintiff was born on 14-5-1969 and that the plaintiff and defendants 1 to 6 are the members of a Hindu Joint Family and the suit Items 1 to 16 are the joint family properties of late Sri Nanjegowda and suit Items 17 and 18 are properties acquired out of the income of the joint family properties by late Nanjegowda as the kartha of the joint family. That the plaintiff and the defendants are in joint possession and enjoyment of the suit properties and that the plaintiff is the only male issue to late Nanjegowda who died on 7-1-1977 when the plaintiff was a minor. That the 1st defendant who is first wife of late Nanjegowda got her name entered in the revenue records and Municipal Registers in respect of the suit properties without the knowledge of the plaintiff and defendants 5 and 6. That the 1st defendant sold suit Items 17 and 18 to the defendants 7 and 8 which came to the knowledge of the plaintiff only after he attained the age of majority. That the plaintiff on coming to know that the 1st defendant was intending to alienate the suit properties, the plaintiff demanded his share which was refused and hence, the suit for partition and separate possession. The plaintiff has also contended that the alienation of suit Items 17 and 18 to defendants 7 and 8 are not binding on him. 3. The defendants 1 to 3 filed their written statements denying any relationship with the plaintiff and defendants 5 and 6. They also denied that the 5th defendant is the wife of late Nanjegowda and also denied that the plaintiff and the defendant 6 being the children of late Nanjegowda. The defendants 1 to 3 contended that it is only the 1st defendant who is the widow of late Nanjcgowda and only defendants 2 and 3 are the children of Nanjegowda. They stated that the late Nanjegowda never married late Kempamma or the 5th defendant-Boramma. They also denied the date of birth of the plaintiff and also denied that the suit properties are the joint family properties of the plaintiff and defendants 1 to 6. 4. The defendants 1 to 3 further contended that suit Items 1 to 15 are the ancestral properties of late Nanjegowda and suit Items 16 to 18 were acquired out of the income of the ancestral properties by the late Nanjegowda. It was further contended by them that the 1st defendant being the only widowChikkamma And Others vs N. Suresh And Others on 30 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/943751/ 1of late Nanjegowda was enjoying all the suit properties with the assistance of her daughters-defendants 2 and 3. They admitted the sale of suit Items 17 and 18 to defendants 7 and 8 but contended that the plaintiff and defendants 4 to 6 cannot question her right to the suit properties to alienate them. It was also contended that suit Items 1 to 16 were also sold by defendants 1 to 3 in favour of one D. Mayanna under a registered sale deed dated 23-2-1988 for valuable consideration which the plaintiff and defendants 4 to 6 have no right to question. They stated that the late Nanjegowda, during his lifetime did not marry either late Kempamma or the 5th defendant-Boramma and contended that even if such marriage has taken place those marriages are void and invalid since Nanjegowda has no right to take a second or third wife in the lifetime of his legally wedded wife, the 1st defendant. It is also contended that the 1st defendant had challenged and questioned the act of Nanjegowda when he made an attempt to take a second wife and that theiv was a compromise under which late Nanjegowda had undertaken not to take a second wife particularly the 5th defendant. It was further contended that the plaintiff and the defendants 4 to 6 were never in possession of the suit properties at any time and that the plaintiff cannot enforce any kind of right to the suit schedule properties which are ancestral properties of deceased Nanjegowda. It was contended that the suit abated for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties and they prayed for dismissal of the suit. 5. The defendant 8 filed his separate written statement denying the case of the plaintiff and also denied the relationship of plaintiff and defendants 4 to 6 with the late Nanjegowda. He also denied the date of birth of the plaintiff. He further denied that the 5th defendant-Boramma is the 3rd wife of Nanjegowda and contended that the plaintiff and the defendants 4 to 6 had no valid right to file the suit and seek their alleged right in the suit properties. According to defendant 8 he has secured a valid title to suit item 17 having secured the same under a registered sale deed dated 16-6-1983 from the true owners. The defendant 7 did not file any written statement. 6. The Trial Court framed the following issues: (1) Whether the genealogical tree set out in para 2 of the plaint is true? (2) Whether L. Nanjegowda had married late Kempamma and 5th defendant-Boramma? (3) Whether the plaintiff is the son of late L. Nanjegowda? (4) Whether the defendants 1 to 3 are the only legal representatives of deceased-L. Nanjegowda as contended by them? (5) Whether the alienation of suit items 17 and 18 in favour of defendants 7 and 8 does not bind the share of the plaintiff in the suit properties? (6) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a share in the suit schedule properties, and if so what share? (7) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mesne profits from the date of suit till separation of his share?Chikkamma And Others vs N.

P. 51 were marked and D.Ws. 1 to 5 were examined on behalf of the defendants and Exs. D. 1 to D. 13 were marked. The Trial Court on appreciation of the evidence on record answered all the issues in favour of the plaintiff and decreed the suit declaring that the plaintiff was entitled to l/10th share in all the suit properties and also declared that the sale of suit Items 17 and 18 in favour of the defendants 8 and 7 respectively does not bind the share of the plaintiff and suit item 17 shall be considered for allotting to the share of defendants 1 to 3 during the course of final decree proceedings. 7. During the course of this appeal, appellant 3 died and she is represented by her L.Rs. Even though several grounds are made out in the grounds of appeal the only ground seriously urged by the learned Counsel appearing for the appellants is that the plaintiff being the illegitimate son of the deceased-Nanjegowda and defendants 5 and 6 being the second wife and her daughter the marriage of 5th defendant having held to be void, the plaintiff cannot claim any rights in the coparcenary property of the late Nanjegowda. According to the learned Counsel, the property in the hands of Nanjegowda are his coparcenary property and not his separate property and in a coparcenary property an illegitimate son and daughter and the second wife of a void marriage cannot claim any right. He has relied upon the Division Bench judgment of this Court in Patel Chandrappa v Hanumanthappa, S. Melagiriyappa and Others v Lalithamma, Smt. Sitabai and Another v Ramchandra and Gowli Buddanna v Commissioner of Income-tax, Mysore. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff and defendants 5 and 6 supporting the judgment of the Trial Court contended that the late Nanjegowda being the sole coparcener, the joint family property in his hands becomes his exclusive property and even an illegitimate son could seek his share as a matter of right in the said property especially in view of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as amended by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Central Act 68 of 1976). 8. As stated earlier the case of the plaintiff is that the late Nanjegowda had three wives viz., Chikkamma-1st defendant, the late Kempamma and the 5th defendant-Boramma who is the mother of the plaintiff. Defendants 2 and 3 are the children of the 1st defendant-Chikkamma. Defendant 4 is the daughter of Boramma and defendant 6 is the sister of the plaintiff. The plaintiffs case is that the plaintiffs and the defendants 1 to 6 are the members of the Hindu Joint Family and the suit properties are the joint family properties of late Nanjegowda and that they are in possession and enjoyment of the suit properties. The plaintiff has claimed his share in the suit properties. The defendants 1 to 3 have denied the relationship alleged by the plaintiff and contended that the plaintiff and the 6th defendant are not the children of late Nanjegowda and the 5th defendant was not his wife. The defendants 1 to 3 claim that it is the 1st defendant who is the only wife of late Nanjegowda and the defendants 2 and 3 are his only children. On the said pleadings the Trial Court framed the above extracted issues. 9. The Trial Court held that the 1st defendant being the widow of late Nanjegowda gets half share in the suit properties and the remaining half share is to be equally shared by the children of late L. Nanjegowda and the plaintiff, his sister and defendants 2 to 4 and 6 being the sons and daughters of late L. Nanjegowda will equally get the other half share in the suit properties and hence the plaintiffChikkamma And Others vs N.

The respondent herein filed H.M.O.P. No. 19 of 1995 for divorce under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Pending final disposal of the main O.P., the respondent herein filed I.A. No. 114 of 1995 claiming interim maintenance for herself and for her daughter at Rs. 3/000/- p.m. and for litigation expenses at Rs. 7,000/-. 3. The petitioner resisted that application contending inter alia that the allegation that the respondent was treated cruelly by him is not true and on the other hand, respondent has been cruel to him and that application filed for the maintenance pendente lite is not sustainable either on facts or in law since the maintenance can be awarded to the wife or to the husband as the case may be, in a case of this kind. Further the respondent's family is in affluent circumstances and that there is no necessity to grant any maintenance pending decision of the main O.P. It is also contended that the maintenance if at all can be granted only to the wife and not for the daughter and at any rate, the sum awarded at Rs. 500 for herself and at Rs. 250/- for the minor daughter is too high. 4. The learned Subordinate Judge, Chidambaram passed an order granting interim maintenance at Rs. 500/-per month for the respondent herein and Rs. 250/- p.m. to the minor daughter from the date of the application till date of the disposal of the main O.P. and a sum of Rs. 2,000/- towards legal expenses to the respondent herein. Aggrieved by the said order, the husband has filed this revision in this Court which was admitted on 15,7.1996. 5. The petitioner mainly contended that the Court below has failed to note that Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act contemplates maintenance pendente lite to only one of them either the husband or the wife as the case may be and not to her daughter as in the present case and hence the granting of maintenance pendente lite to the daughter is not sustainable in law. Taking into consideration of the said argument at the time of admission, Arumugham J. granted interim stay stating ""Interim stay with regard to the order passed by the Court below regarding the maintenance amount to be paid for the daughter alone, and notice returnable in two weets."" The respondent is now represented by her Counsel Mr. P. Mani. At the time of hearing, the very same legal contention was raised, stating that under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, interim maintenance cannot be granted to the child of the marriage and the same can be granted for the spouse only. It is also urged by Mr. N. Vanchinathan, learned Counsel for the petitioner, that the award of maintenancePandian @ Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/692572/ 1pendente lite to the daughter is contrary to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and therefore, the order of the Subordinate Court is vitiated by material irregular) ties in the exercise of its jurisdiction. He denied the allegation that the petitioner is in affluent circumstances and that in any event, the amount now awarded is on the higher side. In support of his contention, Mr. N. Vanchinathan cited the following decisions : Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., . Puram Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, . Kartarchand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Join, . Mr. P. Mani, learned Counsel for the respondent in support of his contention that the Court has power to grant interim maintenance not only to the wife but also for the children under1 Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that any interim maintenance to wife alone is meaningless if it does not provide for the maintenance of the children. In support of his contention, he cited : Dr. D. Thimmappa v. R. Nagavani, AIR 1976 Kar. 215. Manoj K.R. faiswal v. Lila Jaiswal, II (1986) DMC 269. Damodharan v. Meera, . Smt. Subhasini v. B.R. Umakanth, and Gulab Chand v. Sampathi Devi, . 6. Before considering the rival submissions of the legal aspect of the matter, it is beneficial to look into the two important provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 with which we are presently concerned in this lis. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus : ""Chapter 19 Section 24. Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings-Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceedings, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings, and monthly during me proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of me respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable. Chapter 21, Section 26. Custody of Children-In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the 4k decree, upon application by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining and such decree were still pending, and the Court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made"".Pandian @ Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/692572/ 28. Let me deal with the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioner and then deal with the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the respondent. Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., , was rendered by a Division Bench of the said Court. The Division Bench held that in view of the clear provisions of Section 24, there cannot be any dispute that the wife is entitled to pendente lite maintenance when she has no independent income sufficient for her support and also the necessary expenses for the proceedings. In view of the matter, the order for pendente lite maintenance was granted to the defendant No. 1 was maintained. It is also stated in the judgment that Section 24 however does not authorises grant of pendente lite maintenance to the daughter and in terms applies either to the wife or the husband as the case may be. The maintenance ofRs. 10 awarded in favour of the daughter was therefore set aside. 9. Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, , was rendered by the Acting Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The learned Judge held that under Section 24 of the Act, maintenance can be granted during the proceeding in favour of the husband or the wife as the case may be and not in favour of a child born out of the wedlock of the litigating spouses. 10. Kartarchand Dalliram fain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain, , was also rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court (Mehta, J). In this case, the Bombay High Court considered the scope of Sections 24 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Court held that on a reading of Section 24, it becomes evident that section makes provision for granting maintenance pendente lite to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and that section does not provide granting maintenance for the children, that Section 26 of the said Act provides for interim orders from time to time as also for making provision in the decree with regard to custody, maintenance and education of minor children consistently with their wishes, and that therefore' Section 26 empowered the Court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provided for maintenance both pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. The High Court held that the lower Court in granting separate maintenance to each of the three adult daughters had clearly transgressed beyond the scope of the provision of the sections in exercising its jurisdiction and therefore the order was invalid and contrary to law. 11. In the decisions cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioner in Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., , and Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, , both Courts have had no occasion to consider the scope of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriages Act. However in the judgment reported in Kartarchand Dalliram fain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand fain, , the learned Single Judge considered the scope of Section 26 of the Act, and held that Section 26 of the Act empowers the Court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provides for maintenance pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. Further the said Court set aside the grant of maintenance to the three adult daughters on the ground that the Court has awarded-the same beyond the scope of the provision of Sections 24 and 26 of the Act. 12. Let me now consider the rulings cited by the learned Counsel for the respondent in support of his contention in Dr. D. Thimmappa v. R. Nagavani, AIR 1976 Karn. 215, a learned Single Judge of the Kamataka High Court (B.

In this appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts, Act, 1984, the appellant-wife has challenged the judgment and decree dated 18-3-2006 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad in Matrimonial Suit No. 2/2003 whereby he has ordered for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent. 2. The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass: The respondent-Satya Kumar Singh married with the appellant, Smt. Hina Singh on 27-4 2001 in accordance with the Hindu rites and customs. In 2003 the respondent-husband filed an application under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for a decree of restitution of conjugal right alleging, inter alia, that after marriage the appellant lived with him for about three weeks and, thereafter, she went to Kolkata. It was alleged by the respondent that the appellant had gone to Kolkata but she did not come back with him. On 26-10-2001 the appellant came to her matrimonial home and started threatening and torturing the entire family members of the respondent. On 10-12-2001, the father of the respondent along with his two nephews came to the residence of the respondent and took her to Kolkota. Thereafter, the respondent alleged to have made several attempts to take her back to her matrimonial home, but all efforts went in vain. Hence, the respondent filed the aforementioned suit for a decree of restitution of conjugal right. 3. On receipt of summon, the appellant appeared and filed application for time for filing written statement. On last date being 11-2-2005, the Principal Judge allowed time to the appellant for filing written statement by 18-3-2005. On 18-03-2005, the Principal Judge decreed the suit by passing order of dissolution of marriage on mutual consent. The said judgment and decree is the subject of the matter of this appeal. 4. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant assailed the impugned judgment and order as being illegal and wholly without jurisdiction. Learned Counsel submitted that two cases, one under Section 125 Cr.P.C. and another Under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act are pending in the Family Court, Kolkata and interim maintenance was allowed in the said proceeding. Learned Counsel further submitted that the appellant-wife neither filed any com-promise petition nor gave consent for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent. 5. Admittedly, the respondent-husband filed an application under Section 9 of the' Hindu Marriage Act, 1953 in the Court of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad which was registered as Title Matrimonial Suit No. 2 of 2003. In the said application, the only relief sought for by the respondent-husband was for a decree of restitution of conjugal right. However, the Court below in the said suit, passed the impugned judgment/order for dissolution of marriage by a decree ofSmt. Hina Singh vs Satya Kumar Singh on 21 December, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/747714/ 1divorce on mutual consent. 6. Before considering the correctness of the impugned judgment and order passed by the Court below, I would first like to discuss the relevant provision of Hindu Marriage Act which deals with the dissolution of marriage on mutual consent. Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act was introduced by Amendment Act of 1976 which reads as under: 13B. Divorce by mutual consent.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the district Court by both the parties to a marriage together, whether such marriage was solemnized, before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, on the ground that they have been living: separately for a period of one year or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. (2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of the presentation of the petition referred to in Sub-section (1) and not latter than eighteen months after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the Court shall, on being satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, that a marriage has been solemnized and that the averments in the petition are true, pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of the decree. 7. From bare perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is manifestly clear that a joint petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce can be filed by both the parties before the Court on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more and they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. Sub-section (2) of Section 13B of the Act provides that such application shall be considered by the Court not earlier than six months after the date of presentation of the petition and after six months the Court shall consider such application and pass appropriate order in accordance with law. Hence, the requirements of law under this Section are: (i) There must be a petition jointly presented to the Court by both the parties to the marriage, (ii) The grounds for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce must clearly and categorically show: (a) That the parties have been living separately for a period of one year or more before presentation of the petition, (b) That they have not been able to live together and, (c) That they have mutually agreed that the marriage may be dissolved. 8. Besides the above, the requirement of law is that the Court, before passing a decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 13B of the Act, must make an inquiry into the correctness ofSmt. Hina Singh vs Satya Kumar Singh on 21 December, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/747714/ 2the ground set out in the application and thereafter the Court must be satisfied about the correctness of 'the statement made in the joint petition. 9. It is, therefore, clear that for getting a decree for dissolution of marriage under Section 13B of the Act, parties will have to wait for a minimum period of six months after which they have to move the Court once again under Sub-section (2) of Section 13B of the Act. The Court shall have to record its satisfaction that the marriage was solemnized as per rules and that the parties have not resumed cohabitation during the period of six months or more before moving the Court under Sub-section (2) of Section 13B of the Act. 10. The question, therefore, that falls for consideration is as to whether the Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad, has complied the requirement of law or not before passing the impugned judgment/order of dissolution of marriage by mutual consent. As noticed above, on being summoned, the appellant-wife appeared in the suit and on her prayer, time was allowed for filing written statement. The records of the Court below was called for and from perusal of the order-sheets it reveals that the appellant-wife was allowed time for filing written statement. The order dated 5-1-2005 passed by the Court below reads as under: Applicant is present and filed attendance. A time petition has been filed on behalf of the respondent for filing written statement. The respondent is directed to appear physically on 11-2-2005 and file written statement, if any. 11. Besides the above, in all matrimonial suits or proceedings before proceeding with the hearing of the suit or proceeding, a duty is cast upon the Court to comply with the mandatory requirement of law. 12. Section 9 of the Family Courts Act casts a duty on the Court to make every endeavour and persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement. Section 9 of the Family Courts Act reads as under: 9. Duty of Family Court to make efforts for settlement.- (1) In every suit or proceeding, endeavour shall be made by the Family Court in the first instance, where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case, to assist and persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding and for this purpose a family Court may, subject to any rules made by the High Court, follow such procedure as it may deem fit. (2) If, in any suit or proceeding, at any stage, it appears to the Family Court that there is a reasonable possibility of a settlement between the parties, the Family Court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it thinks fit to enable attempts to be made to effect such a settlement. (3) The power conferred by Sub-section (2) shall be in addition to, and in derogation of, any other power of the Family Court to adjourn the proceedings. 13. Similar is the provision is Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act which again casts a duty on the Court to bring about reconciliation between the parties. Section 23 reads as under:Smt.

Through Principal ... on 6 November, 2006 Equivalent citations: 2007 (2) AWC 1780 Author: V Prasad Bench: V Prasad JUDGMENT Vinod Prasad, J. 1. This Habeas Corpus Petition has been filed by Manoj Kumar Gupta son of Sri Vijay Kumar Gupta, Resident of Village and Post Haldi, P.S. Haldi, District Ballia, presently residing at Malli Bazar, Police Station Malli Bazar, District Namachi, South Sikkim seeking the following reliefs: (a) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Habeas Corpus directing respondent authority to produce the respondent No. 6 Smt. Asha Gupta in Court and said the respondent No. 6 of liberty forthwith. (b) issue any other writ, order or direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the circumstances of the case. (c) award the cost of the petition. 2. The petitioner was directed to deposit Rs. 5000/- (Rupees five thousand) for summoning of respondent No. 6, which he had already deposited vide original tender receipt dated 25.9.2006. On 26.7.2006 this Court had issued notices to respondent No. 5 who has appeared in the Court and has filed a counter affidavit through Sri Sudhir Kumar Singh, Advocate on his behalf as well on behalf of respondent No. 6. 3. The averments, which have been made in this Habeas Corpus Petition, are that Smt. Asha Gupta, respondent No. 6 (wrongly described as respondent No. 7) is the legally wedded wife of the petitioner Manoj Kumar Gupta and their marriage was solemnized on 5.5.2005 according to Hindu customs and rights at Malli Bazar South Sikkim. Smt. Asha Gupta, respondent No. 6 after the marriage went along with the petitioner and started living with him as his wife with full pleasure and love. Father of Smt. Asha Gupta, namely, Ashok Kumar Gupta, respondent No. 5 brought back Smt. Asha Gupta, respondent No. 6 to his house at Ballia on the pretext of her serious illness. The petitioner approached Ashok Kumar Gupta many times to send Smt. Asha Gupta but respondent No. 5 all the times made excuses and did not send her. On 11.6.2006 Vijay Kumar Gupta, father of the petitioner along with other respectable persons requested respondent No. 5 Ashok Kumar Gupta to send Asha Gupta to her husband on which a condition was put forth by Ashok Kumar Gupta respondent No. 5 that if he ( Vijay Kumar Gupta)deposits Rs. ten lacs in the name of his daughter Smt. Asha Gupta and transfer some portion of his land in her name only then she will be sent. It is further averred in the petition that the petitioner are four brothers and he is the eldest amongest them and therefore, the land cannot be transferred in the name of Smt. Asha Gupta. It is also averred that Ashok Kumar Gupta respondent No. 5 is pressurizing the petitioner to come and live at Ballia but that is not possible as the petitioner's birth and all educational had taken place in Sikkim and only there he can arrange for a job for him as he is an en-employed youth. He will face greatManoj Kumar Gupta S/O Sri Vijay ... vs State Of U.P.

The further averment is that petitioner had a very sweet relation with respondent No. 6 and from their marital relationship, Smt. Asha Gupta had become pregnant also. The further averment of the petitioner is that Smt. Asha Gupta is ready to go with the petitioner to live with him in Malli Bazar, South Sikkim but her father Ashok Kumar Gupta is an impediment in such an effort. It is further mentioned that respondent No. 5 is pressurizing respondent No. 6 to get aborted and in that event the petitioner will loose the first child. When all the efforts made by the petitioner proved futile to bring back his wife, he approached District Authorities at Ballia for resolving the matter and had also sent letters and representations to the District Magistrate, and Superintendent of Police Ballia on 26.6.2006 (annexure no 1 and 2) The District Administration did not help the petitioner. It is further averred that respondent No. 5 has no right to restrain and detain illegally his wife Smt. Asha Gupta respondent No. 6 and respondent No. 5 is acting illegally and unconstitutionally. The petitioner has averred that the rights guaranteed to him and to his wife under the Constitution are being infringed and curtailed by respondent No. 5. Me had further averred that respondent authorities are also acting illegally, arbitrarily and malafidy. Since the petitioner did not have any other alternative remedy he filed the present habeas corpus petition in this Court. 4. Ashok Kumar Gupta respondent No. 5 had filed a counter affidavit on his behalf as well as on behalf of respondent No. 6 Smt. Asha Gupta, his daughter wherein he has stated that the petitioner is an accused in Crime No. 6/2006, under Section 494, 495, 498 I.P.C, Police Station Kotwali, District Ballia as at the time of marriage with respondent No. 6 the petitioner was already married to one lady Teena Gurang daughter of Padam Bahadur Gurang, resident of Dara Gaon, Post Tadang Bazar, District Gangtok, East Sikkim. He has further alleged that in the marriage he has given dowry of Rs. One lac, Me had filed copy of the F.I.R. of Crime No. 6/2006 of Police Station Kotwali, District Ballia as annexure No. l. He had also filed the marriage certificate of the petitioner along with Teena Gurang as annexure No. 2, to the counter affidavit which indicates that Manoj Kumar Gupta, the petitioner was married with Teena Gurang on 25.2.2005 before Tandra Mittra, Marriage Officer, Village Balakova. Respondent No. 5 also filed the marriage card of the marriage of the petitioner with his daughter as annexure No. 3, which indicates that the marriage between petitioner and respondent No. 6 was solemnized at Ballia. The said marriage invitation card is from the petitioner's side. He had also filed the letter written by respondent No. 6 on 13.6.2005 which indicate that the petitioner's family were demanding a dowry of Rs one lac and respondent No. 6 was also assaulted for the same and she had showed the danger and apprehension to her life. The said letter is annexure No. 4 to the counter affidavit. 5. Under the orders of this Court respondent No. 6 Asha Gupta had appeared before this Court on 30.10.2006 and her statement was recorded in open court. In her statement she had clearly stated that she is graduate from S.C. College Ballia. She had married with the petitioner Manoj Kumar Gupta, who is present in Court. At the time of marriage neither her nor her family members were informed that Manoj Kumar Gupta was already married. Her marriage was solemnized on 5.5.2005 at Ballia. Six days after the marriage she came to know that the petitioner was already married. She does not want to live with the petitioner as he was already married.Manoj Kumar Gupta S/O Sri Vijay ... vs State Of U.P. Through Principal ... on 6 November, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1112803/ 26. Manoj Kumar Gupta, the petitioner also accepted the fact, on enquiry being made by the court that he had married with Teena Gurang in the month of February 2006 and the same year in the month of May 2005 he had marriage with respondent No. 6 Smt. Asha Gupta. He had admitted that he had not sought any divorce from Teena Gurang and she had left the marital company of the petitioner and never came back. There is nothing on record to suggest or even to indicate nor there is any pleading that any divorce, customary or otherwise, took place between petitioner Manoj Kumar Gupta and his first wife Teena Gurang. 7. On the facts mentioned above the present Habeas Corpus Petition has been pressed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner. 8. It was contended by learned Counsel for the petitioner that respondent No. 6 is the legally wedded wife of the petitioner and therefore, respondent No. 5 has no right to detain her and she being major is entitled to go and live with any person according to her own wish. He contended that the first wife of the petitioner has left him and therefore, the marriage of the petitioner with respondent No. 6 will be a valid marriage. He therefore, contended that respondent No. 6 be directed to join the company of her husband, the petitioner and go and live with him and this Court should allow the Habeas Corpus Petition and direct the respondent No. 6 to join the company of the petitioner. 9. Leaned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the marriage of the petitioner with respondent No. 6 was illegal and the petitioner is not the legally wedded husband of respondent No. 6 nor she has been illegally detained by respondent No. 5 who is her father and therefore, the present Habeas Corpus Petition is not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed and suitable compensation be awarded to them. 10. I have considered the submissions raised by both the sides. It is an admitted case of both the sides that both the parties are Hindus and are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 (Act No. 25 of 1955). Section 5 of the said Act lays down conditions for a valid Hindu Marriage. It provides that: 5.-Conditions for a Hindu marriage- A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely: (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; [(ii) at the lime of the marriage, neither party- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanityManoj Kumar Gupta S/O Sri Vijay ... vs State Of U.P.

The wife is the petitioner in Tr.P.(C) No.44 of 2009 while the husband is the petitioner in Tr.P.(C) No.30 of 2009. The prayer made by the wife is to transfer the petition for restitution of conjugal rights filed by the husband, before the Family Court, Kozhikode to the Family Court, Ernakulam, where the petition for divorce filed by the wife is pending. The prayer made by the husband in theSasikumar vs Bindu.S on 27 March, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/456735/ 1Transfer Petition filed by him is to transfer the petition for divorce filed by the wife before the Family Court, Ernakulam to the Family Court, Kozhikode, where the petition filed by the husband for restitution of conjugal rights is pending. It is not in dispute that the petition filed by the husband was earlier in point of time. 3. O.P.No.1792 of 2008 was filed by the wife before the Family TR.P.(C) NOS.30 & 44 OF 2009 :: 2 :: Court, Ernakulam, seeking divorce under Section 13(1)(i-a) and 13(1)(i-b) of the Hindu Marriage Act. O.P.No.1020 of 2008 was filed by the husband against the wife before the Family Court, Kozhikode under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. Both these petitions are pending. 4. Section 21A of the Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows: ""21-A. Power to transfer petitions in certain cases:-- (1) Where-- (a) a petition under this Act has been presented to a district Court having jurisdiction by a party to a marriage praying for a decree for judicial separation under section 10 or for a decree of divorce under section 13, and (b) another petition under this Act has been presented thereafter by the other party to the marriage praying for a decree for judicial separation under section 10 or for a decree of divorce under section 13 on any ground, whether in the same district Court or in a different district Court, in the same State or in a different State, the petitions shall be dealt with as specified in sub-section (2). (2) In a case where sub-section (1) applies,-- (a) if the petitions are presented to the same district Court, both the petitions shall be tried and heard together by that district Court; (b) if the petitions are presented to different district Courts, the petition presented later shall be transferred to the district Court in which the earlier petition was presented and both the petitions shall be heard and disposed of together by the district Court in which the earlier petition was presented. TR.P.(C) NOS.30 & 44 OF 2009 :: 3 :: (3) In a case where clause (b) of sub-section (2) applies, the Court or the Government, as the case may be, competent under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to transfer any suit or proceeding from the district Court in which the later petition has been presented to the district Court in which the earlier petition is pending, shall exercise its powers to transfer such later petition as if it had been empowered so to do under the said Code.""Sasikumar vs Bindu.S on 27 March, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/456735/ 2After the commencement of the Family Courts Act, instead of District Courts, the Family Courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matters mentioned in Section 21A of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. The necessary ingredients to apply Section 21A are: (1) A party to the marriage has filed a petition for a decree for judicial separation under Section 10 or for a decree for divorce under Section 13 of the Act. (2) The other party to the marriage has thereafter filed another petition under Section 10 or under Section 13 either in the same District Court (Family Court) or in a different District Court (Family Court). If the petition is not under Section 10 or Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 21A would have no application. The purpose of Section 21A is clear from sub-section (2) thereof. In a case where sub-section (1) applies, both the petitions shall be tried and heard together by the same Court. If the petitions are presented before the same District Court (Family Court), they shall be heard by that District Court (Family Court) and if the petitions are presented before different District Courts (Family TR.P.(C) NOS.30 & 44 OF 2009 :: 4 :: Courts), the later one shall be transferred to the District Court in which the earlier petition was presented. This provision is intended to avoid conflicting decrees being made by different Courts. Section 21-A as such would not apply where one of the parties files a divorce petition before one Family Court and the other party files a petition for maintenance or a petition for restitution of conjugal rights or a petition for return of ornaments or any other relief in a different Family Court. 6. In Sankaran Nair v. Vijayalekshmi (2007 (3) KLT 280), a Division Bench of this Court considered the scope and ambit of Section 21A and held as follows: ""The pre-condition for exercise of power of transfer under S.21-A of the Act is the pendency of a petition under S.10 of the Act for judicial separation or a petition for decree of divorce under S.13 of the Act before one District Court (presently Family Court), and a petition either under S.10 or under S.13 of the Act on any ground either before the same District Court or a District Court in the same State or a different State. Only in such situations, an order can be passed transferring the petitions for joint trial, if pending before the same District Court or transferring the case to the Court where the case earlier in point of time was filed for joint trial. The mere pendency of various matrimonial disputes between the parties in different Courts or in the same Court will not be sufficient to have either joint trial or transfer to the same Court. Only in a situation where a petition under S.10 for judicial separation or under S.13 for a decree of divorce filed by one party in one District Court and the petition/s for the same relief filed by the other party to the marriage either in the same Court or in a different District Court (Family Court) are pending, the power under S.21A(2) (b) can be exercised either for joint trial or for transfer and joint trial.""

By this order, the Family Court has rejected the application filed by the wife for rejecting the Marriage Petition. She had contended in her application that a Marriage Petition filed under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was not maintainable as she was married to the 1st respondent under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. The interim order passed by the Family Court in an application filed under section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act has been challenged in the writ petition. Since both the Civil Revision Application and the Writ Petition arise from orders passed in the same marriage petition filed before the Family Court, they are being heard together. For the sake of convenience the wife who is the applicant in the Civil Revision Application and the petitioner in the Petition will be hereafter be referred to as the petitioner. The husband who is Respondent No.1 in the Civil Revision Application and the sole Respondent in the Writ Petition will be referred to as the responddent. 2. The facts involved in the present Petition are as follows :- 3. The petitioner and the 1st respondent were married in Japan on 5th November, 1972.

JUSTICE VINOD K. SHARMA Present: - Mr. Gurcharan Dass, Advocate,            for the applicant-appellant.           Mr. G.S. Bhatia, Advocate,           for the non-applicant-respondent.                     ***** VINOD K. SHARMA, J. This application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act has been moved by the applicant-appellant, for grant of maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses. It has been averred in the application, that the respondent -husband is earning a sum of Rs.12,000/- (Rupees twelve thousand only) per month, and in addition has sufficient bank balance from which he is earning interest, therefore, his monthly income is more than Rs.15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand only) per month. Reply to the application has been filed, wherein preliminary CM No. 15-M of 2005 in FAO No. M-50 of 2005 objection has been taken, that the present application, under Section 24 of the HinduGurmit Kaur vs Buta Singh on 11 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1124529/ 1Marriage Act is not maintainable, as at the time of marriage, the applicant-appellant had a living spouse, therefore, the marriage between the parties was null and void, therefore, the applicant- appellant could not be treated to be a wife to be entitled to maintenance under Section 24. It is also pleaded in the reply, that the respondent- husband stands retired on 31.12.2004, and is getting a monthly pension of Rs.5,500/- (Rupees five thousand five hundred only). It has also been pleaded, that he has to look after big family, which consists of his five children and one widow sister. However, the factum that the respondent is getting income by interest from the bank, has not been denied. The stand taken in the reply is, that the applicant-appellant is getting pension of Rs.4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only) per month from the Army Authorities being widow of Surjit Singh and further that her son is major, who is earning Rs.8,000/- (Rupees eight thousand only) per month. On merit it is contended that the applicant-appellant is not entitled to any maintenance, as she has independent source of income. Mr. Gurcharan Dass, learned counsel for the applicant- appellant has placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Chandra Rampratapji Daga Vs. Rameshwari Ramesh Chandra Daga, 2005(1) Apex Court Judgments 396 to contend, that even in case where the marriage is declared as null and void under Section 11 read with Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, the party is entitled to maintenance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Chandra Rampratapji Daga Vs. Rameshwari Ramesh CM No. 15-M of 2005 in FAO No. M-50 of 2005 Chandra Daga (supra) has been pleased to lay down as under: - ""17. In interpreting the provision of Section 25 in the case of Chand Dhawan (supra) the Supreme Court categorically held that the expression 'at the passing (sic. time) of passing any decree,' as has been used in Section 25, includes a decree of nullity of marriage. The relevant observations read thus: - ""On the other hand, under Hindu Marriage Act, in contrast, her claim for maintenance pendente lite is durated (sic) on the pendency of a litigation of the kind envisaged under Sections 9 to 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and her claim to permanent maintenance or alimony is based on the supposition that either her marital status has been strained or affected by passing a decree for restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation in favour of (sic. or) against her, or her marriage stands dissolved by a decree of nullity or divorce, with or without her consent. Thus when her marital status is to be affected or disrupted the court does so by passing a decree for or against her. On or at the time of the happening of that event, the court being seisin of the matter, invokes its ancillary or incidental power to grant permanent alimony. Not only that, the court retains the jurisdiction at subsequent stages to fulfill this incidental or ancillary obligation when moved by an application on that behalf by a party entitled to relief. The court further retains the power to change or alter the order in view of the changed circumstances. Thus the whole exercise is within the gammit (sic gamut) CM No. 15-M of 2005 in FAO No. M-50 of 2005 of a diseased or a broken marriage. And in order to avoid conflict of perceptions the legislature which codifying the Hindu Marriage Act preserved the right of permanent maintenance in favour of the husband or the wife, as the case may be,Gurmit Kaur vs Buta Singh on 11 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1124529/ 2dependent on the court passing a decree of the kind as envisaged under Section 9 to 14 of the Act. In other words without the marital status being affected or disrupted by the matrimonial court under the Hindu Marriage Act the claim of permanent alimony was not to be valid as ancillary or incidental to such affection or disruption. The wife's claim to maintenance necessarily has then to be agitated under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 which is a legislative measure later in point of time than the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, though part of the same socio-legal scheme revolutionizing the law applicable to Hindus. We have thus, in this light, no hesitation in coming to the view that when by court intervention under the Hindu Marriage Act, affectation or disruption to the marital status has come by, at that juncture, while passing the decree, it undoubtedly has the power to grant permanent alimony or maintenance, if that power is invoked at that time. It also retains the power subsequently to be invoked on application by a party entitled to relief. And such order, in all events, remains within the jurisdiction of that court, to be altered or modified as future situations may warrant. 18. In the present case, on the husband's petition, a CM No. 15-M of 2005 in FAO No. M-50 of 2005 decree declaring the second marriage as null and void has been granted. The learned counsel has argued that where the marriage is found to be null and void - meaning nonexistent in eye of law or non est, the present respondent cannot lay a claim as wife for grant of permanent alimony or maintenance. We have critically examined the provisions of Section 25 in the light of conflicting decisions of the High Court cited before us. In our considered opinion, as has been held by this Court in Chand Dhawan's case (supra), the expression used in the opening part of Section 25 enabling the 'Court exercising jurisdiction under the Act' 'at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto' to grant alimony or maintenance cannot be restricted only to, as contended, decree of judicial separation under Section 10 or divorce under Section 13. When the legislature has used such wide expression as 'at the time of passing of any decree,' it encompasses within the expression all kinds of decrees such as restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9, judicial separation under Section 10, declaring marriage as null and void under Section 11, annulment of marriage as voidable under Section 12 and Divorce under Section 13."" Learned counsel for the applicant-appellant also contended, that even in case of null and void marriage if declaration is required to be obtained and proceedings in this regard are commenced, the appellant gets entitled to maintenance pendente lite. Mr. G.S. Bhatia, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, has vehemently contended that the applicant-appellant is not entitled to any maintenance, as the marriage between the parties was null and void from the very inception, therefore, CM No. 15-M of 2005 in FAO No. M-50 of 2005 the status of the applicant-appellant is not that of wife, to attract the provisions of Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.

In the absence of any specific procedure prescribed under pristine Hindu law, custom and statute how is the court to hold whether there has been such conversion or reconversion to Hinduism? Is there not immediate need for legislature intervention and stipulation on this aspect to make law intelligible and user friendly? These questions disturbingly agitate the mind of this court in this Matrimonial Appeal. 2. The petitioners have come to this court aggrieved by the dismissal of their joint application for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The appellants claim to beBetsy vs Nil on 16 October, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91499/ 1spouses. The 2nd appellant is a person who. by birth, is a Hindu. The 1st appellant was a Christian by birth. She continued to be a Christian till she contemplated marriage. The young couple belonging to different religions had fallen in love. Before marriage, according to the 1st appellant, she had converted to Hindu. Their marriage took place in accordance with the Hindu religious rites and rituals. Their marriage was registered at the Misravivaha Sangam Office at Cherpu. The marriage was solemnised on 16/7/1989. Strain developed in the matrimony. Disputes between them reached the court. O.P.No.1340/07 was filed by the wife against the husband claiming return of money and articles. 3. All disputes were settled by them. They prayed in their joint application that their marriage may be dissolved by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. 4. There was no one to oppose the application and according to the appellants their affidavits were filed. It is further submitted that an affidavit of the witness, who had attended the marriage, had also been filed. The court below does not, in the impugned order, refer to the same. The records sent to us show that a copy of the affidavit filed by the stranger/witness dated 15/11/2007 is available in the file. The court below, by the impugned order, took the view that there is no valid solemnisation of marriage as per the Hindu Marriage Act. The relevant observations and findings of the court are extracted below. ""Point: First petitioner is a Christian by religion and second petitioner is a Hindu. Their marriage was registered on 16/7/1989 at Cherpu Misravivaham office. Petitioners contend that first petitioner was professing Hindu religion and marriage was solemnised as per Hindu Marriage Act. Hindu Marriage Act provides for marriage between 2 Hindus. Marriage was not registered as per Special Marriage Act. Petitioner has no case that she was converted into Hindu. Further there is no valid solemnisation of marriage according to Hindu custom and rites. Marriage registered before Misravivaha Sangam Office is not a marriage as per Hindu custom and rites. At any rate, there is no valid solemnisation of marriage. Therefore the petition filed under Section 13(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act is not maintainable. In the absence of valid solemnisation of marriage there cannot be a legal divorce."" 5. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that the stand taken up by the court below is absolutely incorrect and perverse. Parties have asserted that they were Hindus and they got married in accordance with the Hindu rites and ceremonies. There was no objections filed by anyone. In these circumstances, if the court entertained any reservation on the question whether the parties are Hindus and whether there was due solemnisation of marriage in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the court below must have notified the parties about the alleged inadequacy felt by the court and must have given them an opportunity to adduce appropriate evidence. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that they have satisfactory evidence to place before court that the 1st appellant had embraced Hinduism prior to her marriage with the 2nd appellant and that they had got married in accordance with the Hindu religious rites and ceremonies. The appellants would have tendered evidence before the court below to show that the 1st appellant had become a Hindu prior to the solemnisation of marriage, that the marriage was solemnised in accordance withBetsy vs Nil on 16 October, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91499/ 2the Hindu religious rites and customs and also they were living as Hindus thereafter. The learned counsel laments that the court below did not sympathetically and with compassion consider the plight of the two children born in the wedlock. If the court were to hold on unsatisfactory grounds that the marriage of their parents is not legal and valid their legitimacy will unfortunately be in jeopardy. In these circumstances, the learned counsel prays that, at any rate, the matter may be remanded to the court below with directions to permit the appellants to adduce further evidence and to dispose of the case at the earliest. 6. A question arises as to how the appellants can prove that the 1st appellant is a Hindu. On that aspect, arguments are advanced before court. Reliance is placed on the identical definitions of a Hindu appearing in the various statutes in the Hindu Code. We extract below Section 2 of the Hindu Marriage Act which stipulates the applicability of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. Application of Act;- (1) This Act applies- (a) to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments, including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj; (b) to any person who is a Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion; and (c) to any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion, unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu Law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed."" Explanation:- The following persons are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion, as the case may be:- (a) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion; (b) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion and who is brought up as a member of the tribe, community, group or family to which such parent belongs or belonged; and (c) any person who is a convert or re-convert to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh religion.

(3) The expression ""Hindu"" in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though not a Hindu by religion, is, nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section.Betsy vs Nil on 16 October, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91499/ 3","['13', '2']"
386,"Bombay High Court Govind S/O. Manohar Jadhav, Gopal ... vs Smt. Rukhminibai W/O. Manohar ... on 21 April, 2008 Author: P Borkar Bench: P Borkar JUDGMENT P.R. Borkar, J. 1. This is an appeal preferred by original plaintiffs being aggrieved by the dismissal of their original suit bearing Regular Civil Suit No. 210 of 2004 decided by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Nilanga on 29.06.2005, as confirmed in Regular Civil Appeal No. 65 of 2005 by the District Judge - I, Nilanga on 12th September, 2006. The appellant No. 1 & 2 want shares in the property of their father Manohar. 2. Briefly stated facts giving rise to this appeal may be stated as below: Admittedly, Manohar Jadhav married respondent No. 1 Rukminibai. When the said marriage was subsisting, he married appellant No. 3 - Popatbai. Appellant No. 4 - Muktabai is admittedly mother of Manohar. Appellant Nos. 1 and 2 were born to appellant No. 3 from Manohar Jadhav. Respondent No. 2 - Sundarabai is the person who purchased some property from respondent No. 1 pending the suit. 3. Both Courts held that the suit property excluding Survey No. 13 was ancestral property of Manohar and in partition between Manohar and his two brothers, the suit property other than Survey No. 13 was allotted to the share of Manohar Jadhav. The partition between Manohar and his brothers had taken in the year 1984. Manohar died in 1986. Manohar has no son or daughter from his first wife respondent No. 1-Rukminibai. 4. Respondent No. 1-Rukminibai filed Regular Civil Suit No. 94 of 2003 against present appellant Nos. 1 to 3 for partition, but she did not include Survey No. 13 of village Bamni and therefore, appellants filed Regular Civil Suit No. 210 of 1994 for partition and separate possession against respondent No. 1 and included Survey No. 13, and other properties which were subject matter of Regular Civil Suit No. 94 of 2003. Subsequently, respondent No. 2 is added as she had purchased said property Survey No. 13 for consideration of Rs. 1,87,000/-. The Trial Court so also the Appellate Court held that Survey No. 13 admeasuring 81 R of village Bamni was not joint family property, but it was exclusive property of respondent No. 1 and as such is not liable for partition and in the circumstances, the partition was directed of remaining land between appellant No. 4 and respondent No. 1 only. 5. Being aggrieved by the said decision, present appellants preferred Regular Civil Appeal No. 65 of 2005 in the Court of Additional District Judge, Nilanga (as he was then designated). The Additional District Judge dismissed Regular Civil Appeal No. 65 of 2005 filed against judgment and decree passed in Regular Civil Suit No. 210 of 2004 and confirmed the decree passed in Regular Civil Suit No. 210 of 2004 whereby in the properties other than Survey No. 13, 1/2 share of each of appellant No. 4 and respondent No. 1 was recognized and partition was ordered. This appeal is directed against the dismissal of Regular Civil Appeal No. 65 of 2005 whereby the decree in Regular CivilGovind S/O. Manohar Jadhav, Gopal ... vs Smt. Rukhminibai W/O. Manohar ... on 21 April, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/946308/ 1Suit No. 210 of 2004 is confirmed. So, I refer to the facts relating to Regular Civil Suit No. 94 of 2003 and Regular Civil Appeal No. 65 of 2005. It may be noted that in Regular Civil Suit No. 94 of 2003 present appellant No. 1 - Muktabai was not made party, and therefore it was dismissed for non-joinder of necessary party. 6. The substantial question of law framed by this Court while admitting this appeal on 12.10.2007 is as follows: Whether in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the property received by deceased Manohar Jadhav during the course of family partition became his separate property and, therefore, the illegitimate children were entitled to inherit shares in view of Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act, whereby, their status is notionally elevated to that of a legitimate children and hence, the finding rendered by the Courts below on this issue is perverse and contrary to the settled legal position? 7. It is no more disputed before me that appellant No. 3-Popatbai is second wife of deceased Manohar. Admittedly, her marriage with Manohar had taken place after Hindu Marriage Act 1955 came into force and when marriage of Manohar with respondent No. 1-Rukminibai was subsisting and as such marriage of respondent No. 3 with Manohar is void under Section 5(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act. In the circumstances, appellant No. 3-Popatbai is not entitled to any share in the property of Manohar Jadhav, since her marriage with Manohar is void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 8. So far as appellant No. 1 and 2 are concerned, Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is as follows: 16. Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.- (1) Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 1976 (68 of 1976), and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. (2) Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made, who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date of the decree it had been dissolved instead of being annulled, shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of nullity. (3) Nothing contained in Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, any rights into the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents.Govind S/O. Manohar Jadhav, Gopal ... vs Smt. Rukhminibai W/O. Manohar ... on 21 April, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/946308/ 29. So, appellant No. 1 and 2 would be treated as legitimate sons of Manohar Jadhav for the purpose of inheriting separate property of Manohar Jadhav. Learned Advocate Shri Vibhute appearing for the appellants argued that result of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 relating to legitimacy of children of void or voidable marriage is that sons and daughters born out of void or voidable marriage are deemed to be children born in lawful wedlock. He referred to definition of ""Separate Property"" given in Section 228 of the Principles of Hindu Law (Volume I, 20th Edition), Sub-section 6 is to the effect that whenever there is partition and a coparcener obtains a share on partition and if he has no (legitimate) issue, the property allotted to him on partition will partake the nature of separate property. He also pointed out that as per Section 215 of the above said commentary, females cannot be coparceners.So, Manohar was sole coparcerner in possession of his share in the property after partition in 1984 between him and his brothers. 10. Learned Advocate has relied upon page 328 of Maynes Hindu Law and Usages, (15th Edition) for proposition that when at the time of death of the father of a child of a void marriage, the father was the sole coparcener who could have dealt with the property as his own in any manner he liked subject to the right of the female members of the joint family, the coparcenary property in the possession of such a sole coparcener should be held to be the separate or exclusive property of the sole coparcener who is the father of the child of a void marriage for the purpose of Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 11. So far as respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned, they are entitled to share in the property left behind by Manohar Jadhav. I rely on the case of Shantaram Tukaram Patil and Anr. v. Smt. Dagubai Tukaram Patil and Ors. , following observations are made by the Division Bench. 23. ...It is, therefore, perfectly legitimate to import the meaning of legitimacy contained in Section 16, Hindu Marriage Act, into the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act; especially when in the latter Act there is no exclusion of such legitimacy while interpreting the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. We must, therefore, hold that children born of a void marriage and who are regarded as legitimate by virtue of the provisions contained in Section 16, Hindu Marriage Act, are entitled to the rights conferred upon them by Section 16(3) irrespective of the apparent restricted definition of Section 3(1)(j), Hindu Succession Act. 24. ...After examining the provisions of both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Hindu Succession act, we have held above that the children of a void marriage have been given a right to the property of their parents. Since no child acquires a right in the property of its parents by birth, these rights can be exercised only by way of succession to the property. For that purpose they are to be treated as heirs in Class I of the Schedule to the Hindu Succession Act and they are entitled to succeed in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 8, Hindu Succession Act. In that case following conclusions are drawn in para 27. 27. We now summarise the propositions of law emerging from the discussion made above: I. In regard to a child of a void marriage:Govind S/O.

Dutta, J. 1. This is an application under section 115 CPC directed against order No. 90 dated 13.1.98 and order No. 95 dated 2.3.98 passed by the learned second Additional District Judge in MAT Suit No. 75 of 1993. 2. The opposite party husband filed the suit under section 27 of the Special Marriage Act for divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion. He subsequently filed a petition under Order 6 Rule 17 read with section 151 CPC on 11.12.97 for amendment of (lie plaint for addition of an alternative prayer for a decree of nullity of marriage for non-consumatlon of the marriage between the parties and also for consequent amendment of the cause title of the plaint. The respondent wife opposed the prayer for amendment by filing written objection on 5.1.98. The court below was of the view that in view of the averments already made in the original plaint to the effect that there was no cohabitation between the parties, the alternative prayer for a decree of nullity of marriage under section 25 of the Special Marriage Act could have been made at the very inception and that there was no legal bar to making good the omission and as such, the court below was Inclined to allow the petition for amendment but since the said amendment was being made after a lapse of five years from the date of filing of the plaint, the court allowed the amendment subject to payment of cost by the plaintiff opposite party to the respondent petitioner and fixed 28.1.98 for payment of such cost and also for further order with regard to the amendment petition. On 27.2.98, the plaintiff tendered the amount of cost to the respondent petitioner who refused to accept the same on the ground that it was not paid within the date fixed and filed an application praying for rejecting the amendment. Upon hearing both parties, the court gave the liberty to the plaintiff to make the payment of cost by challan in favour of the respondent and fixed 2.3.98 for filing the challan, and on that very date (27.2.98) the plaintiff filed a petition praying for depositing the amendment cost in the court and the court was pleased to allow the prayer and directed the challan to be filed on the date fixed. On the date fixed, the challan showing the deposit of amendment cost was filed and the court was pleased to finally allow the amendment of the plaint. Being aggrieved by this amendment, the wife respondent has come up in the present revision. 3. First, it has been contended by Mr. Tapan Dutta, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that it is one of the settled principles of law that the amendment should not be granted so as to convert the suit into another of a completely different, new and inconsistent character and that by allowing the amendment the learned court below did not follow the above principle. It is next contended by Mr. Dutta that it is also one of the well-established principles of law that no amendment should be allowed the effect of which would be to take away from the defendant a legal right which has accrued to her by lapse of time and that by allowing this amendment, the court below did not also follow this principle. It is submitted that under section 25 of the Special Marriage Act, a marriage which falls within the purview of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the section shall beSupriya Chakraborty (Nee ... vs Champak Kumar Chakraborty on 13 November, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/489513/ 1voidable and may be annuled by a decree of nullity. The two provisos of the section prescribe periods of limitation for Instituting proceedings for the cases specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) respectively but does not prescribe any period of limitation for the case specified in clause (i). By the amendment, the plaintiff opposite party Incorporated the alternative relief of annulment of the marriage by a decree of nullity on the ground specified in clause (i) of section 25. Accordingly, it is argued that sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act would be attracted here and the case under section 25of the Special Marriage Act would be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act and that the said case was already barred by limitation by reason of which a right which had already accrued to the respondent petitioner was sought to be taken away by the amendment in question. In support of his contention that a proceeding under section 25(i) of the Special Marriage Act would be governed by the general law of limitation as provided in Limitation Act, reliance was placed by Mr. Dutta on a Division Bench decision : Sfpra Dey v. Ajtt Kr. Dey. For the reasons aforesaid, it is contended on behalf of the revisionist that the court below committed a jurisdiclional error in allowing the amendment and as such, the impugned orders are liable to be set aside. 4. In repelling the first ground urged on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Subhra Kamal Mukherjee. the learned counsel for the plaintiff opposite party drew my attention to paragraph 2 of the original plaint wherein it has been categorically stated that the marriage has not been consumated since the parties did not stay under the same roof even for a single day since its registration. In the circumstances, it is contended by Mr. Mukherjee that by the Impuged amendment only the relief, which could have been prayed for on the basis of the aforesaid averments but was omitted to be claimed through inadvertance, was being prayed for in the alternative form. Reference was made to Order 7 Rule 7 of the CPC which requires every plaint to state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims either simply or in the alternative and it also provides that it shall not be necessary to ask for general or other relief which may always be given as the court may think just to the same extent as if it had been asked for. It is submitted by Mr. Mukherjee that in order to strictly comply with the requirements of Order 7 Rule 7, the alternative relief, to which the plaintiff opposite party would have been otherwise entitled by reason of the alleged non-consumation of the marriage which has already been pleaded in the original plaint, was being specially asked for. In the circumstances, it is contended that the addition of the alternative relief allowed by the court below would not have the effect of introducing a totally new, different and inconsistent plea altogether as suggested by Mr. Dutta. In repellng the second ground urged on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Mukherjee contended that the provisions of the Limitaition Act would not be applicable to a case under section 25(1) of the Special Marriage Act in view of the provisions of sub section (3) of section 29 of the Limitation Act and he placed his reliance on the Supreme Court decision : Lata Kamat v. Vilas. It is contended by Mr. Mukherjee that the Calcutta decision cited by Mr. Dutta would be of no help to the petitioner inasmuch as it does not lay down any authority for the proposition that sub section (3) of section 29 of the Limitation Act would not exclude the operation of the provisions of the Limitation Act to a suit with respect to marriage and divorce. Reference was also made to section 34(1)(e) of the Special Marriage Act and it was contended by Mr. Mukherjee that even in the absence of any specific period of limitation prescribed by section 25 of the Special Marriage Act for the case covered by clause (1) of the section and also Insplte of non-applicability of the provisions of the general law of limitation as provided in the Limitation Act. It cannot be said that there is absolutely no time limit for getting a relief under section 25(1) Inasmuch as clause (e) of sub section (1) of section 34 of the ActSupriya Chakraborty (Nee ... vs Champak Kumar Chakraborty on 13 November, 1998 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/489513/ 2categorically provides that in any proceeding under Chapter V and VI (the present case being a proceeding under Chapter VI), whether defended or not, the court is to decree the relief only when it is satisfied that there has not been any unnecessary or Improper delay in Instituting the proceeding and not otherwise. It Is, therefore, idle to suggest that the court below has by the Impugned orders granted relief to be added after it had already become time barred. Accordingly, it is submitted that there is no case for Interference with the Impugned orders. 5. Let me now examine the grounds that were urged on behalf of the revisionist. In view of the averments made in paragraph 2 of the plaint, it cannot be said that by the impugned amendment an altogether new, different and Inconsistent plea was being taken by the plaintiff opposite parly. On the basis of what has been pleaded in paragraph 2 of the pallnt, the plaintiff could have prayed for the alternative relief for annulment of marriage by a decree of nullity under section 25(1) of the Special Marriage Act. As such, no element of surprise was being Introduced by the addition of the alternative relief by way of amendment. Moreover, under Order 7 Rule 7 the alternative relief was required to be specifically asked for in the plaint. The omlssfoln was nothing hut inadvertant and as such, it cannot be said that the learned court below was unjustified in allowing the omission to be made good. 6. I now come to the other ground which is based on the question of limitation. Undisputedly, the matrimonial suit was instituted a few days after the expiry of three years from the date of solemnisation of the marriage. According to Mr. Dutta, the suit for annulment of marriage under section 25(1) of the Special Marriage Act would be governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act. It is submitted that the residuary article of the Limitation Act would actually govern this suit so far as it relates to the amended relief and the said relief was already time barred when the amendment was allowed and as such, the Impugned amendment should not have been allowed Inasmuch as it would take away the right that has already accrued to the petitioner. On behalf of the opposite party, it is urged that the provisions of the Limitation Act would not at all apply here and as such, the question of allowing a time-barred claim to be added would not arise. Section 29 of the Limitation Act reads as under : ""29. Savings (1) nothing in this Act shall affect section 25 of the Indian contract Act, 1872. (2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only insofar as. and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. (3) Save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any such law.

388,"Madras High Court Valliammal vs Kamalambal And Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Equivalent citations: (1990) 2 MLJ 307 Author: T Sathiadev JUDGMENT T. Sathiadev, J. 1. This appeal is preferred by plaintiffs in O.S. No.3116 of 1979 on the file of City Civil Court, Madras. Defendants are the respondents herein. 2. The suit was filed by appellants/plaintiffs (ranking of parties as in suit) for recovery of possession of the suit property and for an injunction restraining the defendants from collecting rents from tenants, and to pay a sum of Rs.4,200 which had been unauthorisedly collected, that too by first defendant. 3. In the plaint it is claimed as follows: Plaintiff is the lawfully wedded wife of one Raju Mudaliar, and their marriage took place on 23.8.1934, and plaintiffs 2 to 8 are the children born to them. On 1.5.1949 he married the first defendant as his second wife by going through some form of marriage in a temple at Tiruvanmiyur. The ceremonies were not in accord with Hindu rites and customs. At the time when a second marriage was prohibited under the provisions of Hindu Prevention of Bigamous Marriage Act (Madras Act 6 of 1949), which had come into force on 23.3.1949, he having married her, she was not his lawfully wedded wife. She was at best a permanent kept-mistress. Defendants 2 and 3 born to them are illegitimate children, and therefore none of the defendants have any right to the properties left behind by Raju Mudaliar, who died on 7.2.1979. Plaintiffs 1 to 8 are the nearest heirs under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Defendants 2 and 3 are not entitled to inherit his properties because Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act will not apply to them. Since defendants are in unlawful possession of the plaint schedule properties, plaintiffs have filed the present suit. 4. Defendants took up the stand that the marriage between the first defendant and Raju Mudaliar was performed according to Hindu rites On 7.5.1948 (sic) (1949 ?) at Tiruvanmiyur Temple, and that the said marriage was not void under Madras Act 6 of 1949. First defendant and the plaintiffs and the children born to them were all living together in the same premises at St. Mary's Road for about 8 years, and that the mother of Raju Mudaliar was also alive, and that the house in Narayana Chetty Street was built by him for the benefit of the first defendant and children were born to hen The suit property was purchased three years after the marriage for her benefit. If really the marriage was void, the plaintiffs would not have kept quiet since 1949. Hence the suit is liable to be dismissed. 5. Trial Court dismissed the suit by holding that Raju Mudaliar married first defendant on 7.5.1949 at Tiruvanmiyur Temple, and the said marriage was not void under Madras Act 6 of 1949, and that the plaintiff, defendants, Raju Mudaliar and his mother were all living together as one family; and that during the life time of Raju Mudaliar, the status of the first defendant was never questioned. On appeal in A.S. No. 184 of 1981, the learned Judge by relying upon the date of marriage furnished by Raju Mudaliar in the will (Exhibit A-3) dated 21.10.1966 held that he married the first defendant only on 1.5.1949, and hence, the said marriage was hit by Madras Act 6 of 194y, which became aValliammal vs Kamalambal And Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/798632/ 1statute on 23.3.1949. Consequenty it was held that she would not be entitled to any share, but her two daughters viz. defendants 2 and 3 are equally entitled to a share along with the plaintiffs, though they are illegitimate. Reliance was placed on Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act for granting the said relief. Taking note of the fact that parties are co-sharers, except to pass a declaratory decree, the learned Judge directed the parties to obtain appropriate reliefs by filing a suit for partition and separate possession. Aggrieved against this decision, this Letters Patent Appeal is preferred by plaintiffs. Mr. T. Viswanatha Rao learned Counsel for the plaintiffs, submits that, haying held that Raju Mudaliar married first defendant on 1.5.1949, and such a marriage is hit by Madras Act 6 of 1949,' defendants 2 and 3 could not have been granted any declaratory relief regarding their share; because as illegitimate children, they cannot be treated on a par with plaintiffs 2 to 8, because Section 16(3) of the amended Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case. Any marriage of this character preceding Hindu Marriage Act. 1955 would not come within the folds of the relief extended under Section 16(3) of the Act It is only prospective in its applicability, and hence, the rights of defendants 2 and 3 would be as was obtaining under the Hindu Law, before the passing of the Hindu Marriage Act, and the Hindu Succession Act. 6. Mr. T.R. Mani, learned Counsel for the defendants, would submit that the purpose of introducing amendment to the Act in 1976 was to extend the benefit of legitimisation available to bastards. When an amendment was made not only to Hindu Marriage Act but also to Special Marriage Act, it was intended to be as far as possible beneficial, and in essence it is retrospective, because as held by Courts, the mischief which is sought to be removed by the amendment, will determine the scope of the amendment, and that if the benefit is confined only to children of bigamous marriages under Hindu Marriage Act and not to children born out of such marriages which had taken place prior to it, it would offend Aft. 14 of the Constitution. He would also touch upon the trend of legislations intended to bring about social reforms and how to eschew arbitrariness, and as how the object of an amendment, require to be interpreted to eradicate the mischief which it seeks to avoid, and that clear interpretation, if applied, would remove the concept of bastard was, which no human being would ever like to have. 7. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was amended by, the Marriage Laws of Amendment Act, 1976, with effect from 27-5-1976 to the following effect: 1. Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who had been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. 2. Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made, who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date, of the decree it had been dissolved instead of being annulled, shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of nullity.Valliammal vs Kamalambal And Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/798632/ 23. Nothing contained in sub-S (1) or sub-S (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void or which if annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents. 8. Section 11 of Hindu Marriage Act reads as follows: Any marriage solemnised after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto (against the other party) be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in Clauses (1), (iv) and (v) of Section 5. 9. Regarding the finding as to when Raju Mudaliar was married to first defendant, as pointed out by the learned Judge, except for the first defendant and her brother, none has come forward to speak about the marriage, and therefore, having rightly characterised their evidence as interested, reliance was placed on the unimpeachable contents of Exhibit A-3 will dated 21.10.1967. It was executed by Raju Mudaliar in favour of first defendant, long before disputes arose between the parties. No doubt it was revoked under Ex.A4 dated. 15.11.1974, but even then, as a piece of evidence, its content were relied upon, and in this view, the learned Judge had rightly concluded that this piece of documentary evidence clinchingly proves that the marriage took place only on 1.5.1949. Madras Act 6 of 1949 prohibiting bigamy came into force on 23.3.1949. The marriage which took place on 1.5.1949 being invalid and inoperative in law, the children born out of such relationship are illegitimate. 10. It is contended by Mr. T.R. Mani, learned Counsel for the defendants, that this illegitimacy would not disentitle them to get an equal share like that of legitimate children of Raju Mudaliar, in view of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which had been amended with effect from 27.5.1976 by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 68 of 1976). He submits that children born out of such bigamous relationship, by virtue of this amendment, are entitled to be treated on a par with that of the legitimate children. Mr. Viswanath Rao, learned Counsel for the plaintiff, would submit that Section 16, a non-obstanti provision, deals with only a specific class of illegitimate children born out of a marriage which will be null and void under Section 11 and confined to children, who were born before or after the commencement of the Amendment Act i.e. before or after 27.5.1976. As for children born before that date, it is confined to the off-springs of the marriages which had been ""solemnised after the commencement of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 i.e. after 18.5.1955 and not in respect of marriages which had taken place antecedent to that date. 11. Learned Counsel would first refer to the decision of the Division Bench reported in Shantaram v. Dagubai which, in dealing with the scope of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, has held that whether a decree of nullity is passed or not, a child born out of a marriage which is void under the provisions of the Act is the legitimate child. It was further held that it does not acquire a right to property by birth which a legitimate child would get; but after legitimacy conferred upon him under Section 16(3) of the Act, it enables him to get an equal share in the property of his parents. Such a right is conferred (? confined) only to separate property and not in respect of co-parcenary propertyValliammal vs Kamalambal And Ors. on 21 July, 1989 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/798632/ 3","['5', '11', '12', '16']"

No. 114 of 1995 in H.M.0.P.19 of 1995 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Chidambaram awarding interim maintenance pendente lite at Rs. 500 p.m. to the respondent herein and Rs. 250 for the minor daughter and a sum of Rs. 2,000 for litigation expenses. 2. The respondent herein filed H.M.O.P. No. 19 of 1995 for divorce under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Pending final disposal of the main O.P., the respondent herein filed I.A. No. 114 of 1995 claiming interim maintenance for herself and for her daughter at Rs. 3,000 p.m. and for litigation expenses at Rs. 7,000. 3. The petitioner resisted that application contending inter alia that the allegation that the respondent was treated cruelly by him is not true and on the other hand, respondent has been cruel to him and that application filed for the maintenance pendente lite is not sustainable either on facts or in law since the maintenance can be awarded to the wife or to the husband as the case may be, in a case of this kind. Further the respondent's family is in affluent circumstances and that there is no necessity to grant any maintenance pending decision of the main O.P. It is also contended that the maintenance if at all can be granted only to the wife and not for the daughter, and at any rate, the sum awarded at Rs. 500 for herself and at Rs. 250 for the minor daughter is too high. 4. The learned Subordinate Judge, Chidambaram passed an order granting interim maintenance at Rs. 500 per month for the respondent herein and Rs. 250 p.m. to the minor daughter from the date of the application till date of the disposal of the main O.P. and a sum of Rs. 2,000 towards legal expenses to the respondent herein. Aggrieved by the said order, the husband has filed this revision in this Court which was admitted on 15.7.1996. 5. The petitioner mainly contended that the Court below has failed to note that Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act contemplates maintenance pendente lite to only one of them either the husband or the wife as the case may be and not to her daughter as in the present case and hence the granting of maintenance pendente lite to the daughter is not sustainable in law. Taking into consideration of the said argument at the time of admission, Arumugham, J. granted interim stay stating ""Interim stay with regard to the order passed by the Court below regarding the maintenance amount to be paid for the daughter alone, and notice returnable in two weeks."" The respondent is now represented by her counsel Mr. P. Mani. At the time of hearing, the very same legal contention was raised, stating that under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, interim maintenance cannot be granted to the child of the marriage and the same can be granted for the spouse only. It is also urged by Mr. N. Vanchinathan, learned Counsel for the petitioner, that the award of maintenance pendente lite to the daughter is contrary to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and therefore,Pandian Alias Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4420/ 1the order of the subordinate court is vitiated by material irregularities in the exercise of its jurisdiction, he denied the allegation that the petitioner is in affluent circumstances and that in any event, the amount now awarded is on the higher side. In support of his contention, Mr. N. Vanchinathan cited the following decisions: Assam Chinna Bapu v. Akasam Parbati ; Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi ; Kartarchand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain . Mr. P. Mani, learned Counsel for the respondent in support of his contention that the court has power to grant interim maintenance not only to the wife but also for the children under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that any interim maintenance to wife alone is meaningless if it does not provide for the maintenance of the children has cited the following rulings. Dr. D. Thimappa v. R. Nagavani A.I.R. 1976 Karn. 215; Manoj K.R. Jaiswal v. Lile Jaiswal (1986) 2 D.M.C. 269; Damodharan v. Meera ; Smt. Subhasini v. B.R. Umakanth ; Gulab Chand v. Sampati Devi. 6. Before considering the rival submissions on the legal aspect of the matter, it is beneficial to look into the two important provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 with which we are presently concerned in this lis. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus: Chapter 19 Section 24 - Maintenance Pendente lite and expenses of proceedings. Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife of the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceedings, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable. Chapter 21. Section 26 - Cutody of children. ""In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree, upon application by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining and such decree were still pending, and the court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made. 8. Let me deal with the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioner and then deal with the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the respondent. Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr. was rendered by a Division Bench of the said Court. The Division Bench held that in view of the clear provisions of Section 24, there cannot be any dispute that the wife is entitled to pendente lite maintenance when she has no independent income sufficient for her support and also the necessary expenses for the proceedings. In view of the matter, the order for pendente lite maintenance wasPandian Alias Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4420/ 2granted to the defendant No. l was maintained. It is also stated in the judgment that Section 24 however does not authorise grant of pendente lite maintenance to the daughter and in terms applies either to the wife or the husband as the case may be. The maintenance of Rs. 10 awarded in favour of the daughter therefore set aside. 9. Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi was rendered by the Acting Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The learned Judge held that under Section 24 of the Act, maintenance can be granted during the proceeding in favour of the husband or the wife as the case may be and not in favour of a child born out of the wedlock of the litigating spouses. 10. Kartarchand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain, was also rendered by a learned single Judge of the Bombay High Court (Mehta, J.) In this case, the Bombay High Court considered the scope of the Sections 24 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Court held that on a reading of Section 24, it becomes evident that the Section makes provision for granting maintenance pendente lite to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and that Section does not provide granting maintenance for the children, that Section 26 of the said Act provides for interim orders from time to time as also for making provision in the decree with regard to custody, maintenance and education of minor children consistently with their wishes, and that therefore Section 26 empowered the court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provided for maintenance both pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. The High Court held that the lower court in granting separate maintenance to each of the three adult daughters had clearly transgressed beyond the scope of the provision of the Section s in exercising its jurisdiction and therefore the order was invalid and contrary to law. 11. In the decisions cited by the learned Counsel, for the petitioner in Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr. and Pura Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi both courts have had no occasion to consider the scope of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. However in the judgment reported in Kartarchand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain , the learned single Judge considered the scope of Section 26 of the Act, and held that Section 26 of the Act empowers the court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provides for maintenance pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. Further the said Court set aside the grant of maintenance to the three adult daughters on the ground that the Court has awarded the same beyond the scope of the provision of Sections 24 and 26 of the Act. 12. Let me now consider the rulings cited by the learned Counsel for the respondent in support of his contention. In Dr. D. Thimmappa v. R. Nagavani A.I.R. 1976 Karn. 215 a learned single Judge of the Karnataka High Court (B.

The defendant-appellant, has filed the present First Appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, against the judgment and order dated 18.5 90 passed by the Judge, Family Court, Jhansi in Misc. CaseNo. 25/89 rejecting her restoration application along with an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act 1963 (for short the Act) under Article 123 of the Act the period of limitation to set aside an ex-parte decree was 30 days from the date of decree, or where summons or notice was not duly served, when the applicant had knowledge of the decree. The application for restoration was filed by the appellant (the wife) against the ex-parte decree dated 30.5.89 passed by the Family Court in Matrimonial case No. 65 of 1988 (Mahesh Sharma v. Smt. Deep Mala Sharma) under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, granting ex-parte decree for divorce in favour of the respondent (the husband) This restoration application was filed under order 9 rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (for short the Code). 2. The material facts which are almost admitted, may be stated. A petition for divorce was filed by the respondent (the husband) against the appellant, (the wife) under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which was decreed ex-parte on 30.5.89 without any knowledge of the appellant, the wife. It was averred in the restoration application supported by a Medical Certificate of the Doctor, filed by the defendant that she fell ill on 1.3.89 and recovered on 28 3 89. Unfortunately on 29th March, 1989 her younger sister Ku. Kamla died and the appellant plunged in grief and sorrow. She came to know of the ex-parte decree on 16 2.89 when the parties appeared in another suit filed by the appellant, the wife with the relief for the restitution of conjugal rights in a Family Court at Gwalior. Notices were served on Mahesh Sharma, the respondent-husband and be was directed that he may get the suit for restitution of conjugal rights decided on the basis of conciliation. After disposal of suit for restitution of conjugal rights, the petition for divorce at Jhansi was to be decided in which 3.3.89 was the date fixed for disposal of application filed by the appellant for awarding her some amount in connection with the expenses of litigation. Under these circumstances it was averred that 30 days Limitation under Article 123 of the Act was to be counted from 15.9.89 when she was informed about the ex-parte decree in the divorce suit in the case of restitution of conjugal rights pending in the Family Court at Gwalior. She prayed that under these pressing circumstances the delay in filing the restoration application may be condoned and the same may be allowed and ex pane decree may be set aside. That application, however, has been rejected by the impugned order. 3. The respondent-husband contested the restoration application stating that appellant has got knowledge much earlier, and in any case, even after the death of her younger sister on 29,3.89, within 13 days the ritual ceremony amongst Hindus is over and thereafter she need and could not be in grief or sorrow, hence could have filed the restoration application immediately after 13th day. The Court below has rejected the restoration application and the averments contained therein was disbelieved and held the application to be time barred. Hence the present appeal has been filed.Deep Mala Sharma vs Mahesh Sharma on 28 November, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1864344/ 14. Sri Harish Kumar Sharma, learned. Counsel for the appellant strenuously urged that the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 were applicable and the restoration application was well within time, under Article 123 of the Act, from the date of knowledge. The application under Section 5 of the Act has to be considered with a view to advance substantial justice. The Hindu Marriage Act and the Family Court's Act were legislation of predominant social nature and it may be interpreted in that light so as to advance the object of legislation. Strong reliance was placed in Kerala State Electricity Board v. T.P. Kunhaliaumma (AIR 1977 SC 282) to the effect that whereever a petition was filed under any Act before the Civil Court and it was pending, the provisions of the Act would apply. 5. Sri A.S. Diwakar, learned Counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, ugred that the Limitation Act was not applicable, the delay was not explained hence application Under Section 5 was correctly rejected and similarly restoration application was also correctly rejected. Reliance was placed on Lata Kamatv. Vilas, judgments Today 1989 (3) Supreme Court 48 (AIR 1989 SC 1427), where under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act the limitation was 30 days for preferring appeal and the schedule under the Limitation Act did not provide for period of appeal under the Hindu Marriage Act. In view of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, the provisions of Sees. 4 to 24 of the Act will be applicable unless they are not expressly excluded. 6. Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties, the points that fall for our determination are as to what ought to be the approach of a Court in deciding the matter arising out of statute predominantly dealing with matters pertaining to social and benevolent character, and whether the Limitation Act was applicable to the proceedings under the Family Courts Act and lastly as to whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the restoration application filed by the appellant could be treated to be within time and the delay could be deemed to have been explained. 7. As regards the first point, suffice it to say that there is no denying the fact that the approach of a Court to a statute of predominant social nature has to be made in that light and the Court has to take a broader view of the background and policy of the statute in question (See Summers v, Seaford Corporation (1943) A.C. 283 : Brown v. Brash & Ambrose, (1 48) 1 AH. E.R. 922 : Okerake v. Brant London Borogh Council (1967) I DB 42). The objects of legislation particularly the object Hindu Marriage Act and the Family Courts Act have to be kept in mind. In Otherath Lakshmi Amma & Another v. Nella Chinkuniyll Govindan Naiyer, Judgment Today (1990) 3 SCC 230, it was held that in case a statute contains social and benevolent provisions, the Court has to take precaution in deciding such matters and the dominant purpose of the statute, intention of legislature and the policy underlying such statute has to be considered while construing the provisions. 8. In Amirthan Kudanban v. Sarnam Kudanban (1991) 3 SCC 20, it was held in connection with Sections 8(3) 5(a) and 5 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 that the statute pertaining to social and beneficial matters containing benevolent provisions should not be construed too rigidly as the same is for protection of certain class of persons. In the present case the provisions of Family Courts act and Hindu Marriage Act are predominantly of social nature. The Family Courts were established with a view to promote conciliation and secure speedy settlement of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and the greater emphasis was on conciliation andDeep Mala Sharma vs Mahesh Sharma on 28 November, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1864344/ 2achieving social and desirable results and adherence to rigid rule of procedure or evidence were to be eliminated. The Family Courts established under the Act ought to adopt an approach different from that adopted in ordinary civil proceedings. In the present case we are constrained to observe that the Judge Family Court has made a pedentic approach as is some times made in ordinary civil proceedings, whereas the Judge Family Court was dealing with the matter predominantly of social character and he should not have made a rigid approach rather he must have taken a broader view of the background and policy underlying the statute. He must not have forgotten the intention of legislature. 9. As regards the second point as to whether the provisions of Limitation Act were applicable, under Section 10 of the Family Court's Act it has been provided that subject to other provisions of the Act and Rules the provisions of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908 and ""of any other law for the time being in force"" shall apply to suits and proceedings before a Family Court (other than proceedings under chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) and for the purposes of such provisions of the code, the Family Court shall be deemed to be a civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court. The Limitation Act, particularly Section 5 thereof provides that when sufficient cause has been shown the delay in preferring appeal or application can be condoned. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and ""of any other law for the time being in force"" have been made applicable to the suits and proceedings before a Judge Family Court which has been declared to be deemed to be a civil Court having all the powers of such Court. The expression ""of any other law for the time being in force"" under Section 10 of the Family Courts Act is comprehensive enough to include the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 to be made applicable to proceedings under the Family Courts Act. There would be no justification in restricting the meaning of the expression of any other law for the time being in force"", which is couched in a language having a very wide sweep. The provisions of a statute dealing with social and beneficient provisions should not be interpreted in a rigid manner, rather a broader view must be taken consistent with the object of legislation. The object and reasons of the establishment of Family Courts were to emphasise conciliation and achieving the socially desirable results and adherence to rigid rules of procedure and evidence were to be eliminated. In case the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act were not made applicable, there might be so many cases where, particularly in a country like ours, where a sizable Section of society suffers from illiteracy, it would not be proper to adjudicate matters pertaining to marriage, restitution of conjugal rights and maintenance and divorce etc. without providing some opportunity to file an application or appeal beyond the period of limitation of 30 days, by taking a rigid view of limitation, rather there may be bonafide lack of knowledge or compelling circumstances like illness, death of a family member and similar other matters on account of which any person may be prevented from preferring appeal or any application within the prescribed period. 10. Smt. Lata Kamal v. Vilas, (supra), relied upon by Sri A.S. Diwakar, learned Counsel for the respondent, was a case where the provisions of limitation Act were made applicable, and it was held under para 12 (page 1484) as follows:Deep Mala Sharma vs Mahesh Sharma on 28 November, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1864344/ 3","['10', '13', '19', '5', '28', '29']"

While hearing Second Appeals Nos. 33, 48, 53, 88, 101 and 114 of 2006, learned Single Judge found that following question arose before him, which called for consideration by a Division Bench and, therefore, directed the Registry to place the papers before the Honourable the Chief Justice for appropriate orders: (1) Whether, after amendment of Section 28 of Hindu Marriage Act by Marriage Laws Amendment Act, 1976 (Act No. 68 of 1976), a second appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court would be maintainable. 2. By virtue of orders passed by the Honourable the Chief Justice on 17th April, 2007, these matters came to be listed before this Bench. 3. We have heard learned Advocates, Mrs. Pahwa, Miss Shilpa Shah, Mr. N.K. Majmudar, Miss Shalini Nair, Mr. Shalin N. Mehta and Mr. Aspi Kapadia, for the parties. We must place on record that the learned Advocates rendered assistance to us with an objective approach. From their submissions, two views were canvassed. According to learned Advocates, Mrs. Pahwa, Miss Shilpa Shah, Mr. N.K. Majmudar and Miss Shalini Nair, a second appeal against the decree passed by District Court in an appeal from a decree of the Civil Court in a Hindu Marriage Petition would be maintainable before High Court and would be governed by Section 100 of Page 1535 the Code of Civil Procedure, whereas, according to learned Advocates, Mr. Shalin Mehta and Mr. Aspi Kapadia, a second appeal would not be maintainable before this Court in light of provision contained in Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act as it stands after the amendment of 1976. 4. The submissions made by learned Advocates, Mr. Aspi Kapadia and Mr. Shalin Mehta, can be briefly stated thus: 4.1 If Section 28 of the Act is interpreted to provide for an appeal from a decree passed by an Appellate Court, the number of appeals that can be filed would be unlimited and that cannot be the intention of the Legislature. On the contrary, it would run against the intention of the law makers of curtailing the delay in disposal of matrimonial petitions under the Act. 4.2 Since the right of appeal flows from Section 28 of the Act, the scope of the appeal under the said provision would be as wide as that of a First Appeal in light of the interpretation given by this Court in the case of Umiyaben, daughter of Chhotabhai Talsibhai and wife of Ambalal Laxmidas v. Ambalal Laxmidas 1965 GLR, 714. The Legislature could not have intended such unfettered right of appeal.Bhavna Amit Pathakji And 3 Ors. vs Amit Manavantchandra Pathakji, ... on 23 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1247357/ 14.3 A decree under the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be considered as a decree as defined in Section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and, therefore, Section 96 or 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not be applicable and, therefore, a second appeal is not contemplated under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. On the other hand, the substance of the submissions made by learned Advocates, Mrs. Pahwa, Miss Shilpa Shah, Mr. N.K. Majmudar and Miss Shalini Nair can be narrated thus: 5.1 Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it stands today, is the source giving right of appeal and it makes all decrees made by a Court in a proceeding under this Act appealable. A decree passed in an appeal by a District Court is a decree passed in a proceeding under the Act and, therefore, would be appealable. Section 28(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act also provides that an appeal would lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Therefore, if a decree passed in an appeal arising from a decree of Civil Court under the Hindu Marriage Act is to be treated as a decree passed by the District Court in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, an appeal would lie before the High Court. 5.2 So far as scope of second appeal is concerned, it was contended that Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act would govern the question which provides that all proceedings under the Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by Code of Civil Procedure subject, of course, to other provisions contained in the Act or subject to such rules that may be made by High Court in this behalf. It was contended that there is no provision in the Hindu Marriage Act repugnant to Page 1536 Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Under the circumstances, an appeal before the High Court against an appellate decree under the Hindu Marriage Act would be governed by Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 5.3 It was also contended that the apprehension about innumerable appeals is also out of place in light of Section 100A of the Code of Civil Procedure. 6. We have examined rival side contentions. We have also gone through the judgments relied upon by learned Advocates. 7. We are called upon to examine and interpret Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as it stands now. While examining the said question, we have to bear in mind the principles governing such interpretation. The Apex Court in the case of Bengal Immunity Company v. State of Bihar said that mainly four aspects are required to be considered, namely, (a) What was the common law before the making of the Act?; (b) What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide?; (c) What remedy the Parliament has resolved and appointed to cure the disease?; and (d) The true reason of the remedy. 7.1 The Supreme Court, subsequently, in the case of R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr. , observed thus:Bhavna Amit Pathakji And 3 Ors. vs Amit Manavantchandra Pathakji, ... on 23 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1247357/ 2The Court dealing with interpretation of an Act should have regard to the history of the legislation, the declared object thereof and the wording of the statute. 8. With the above principles in mind, we propose, now, to examine the question referred to us. 9. In our view, since the question is complex and involves two questions, in order that the question is properly dealt with and answered, it has to be split into two questions- (A) Whether, after the amendment of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a Second Appeal is maintainable? (B) Whether such Second Appeal would be maintainable under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure? 10. Section 28, as it exists today, was substituted for the old Section by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 and it reads as under- 28. Appeals from decrees and orders : (1) All decrees made by the court in any proceeding under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable as decrees of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Page 1537 (2) Orders made by the court in any proceeding under this Act under Section 25 or Section 26 shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable if they are not interim orders, and every such appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (3) There shall be no appeal under this Section on the subject of costs only. (4) Every appeal under this Section shall be preferred within a period of ninety days from the date of the decree or order. While effecting this amendment, recommendations of the Law Commission made in its 59th Report were considered. The Law Commission observed : It would appear that most of the remedies conferred by the Hindu Marriage Act (to be pursued by a petition) being of a special character, it would be meaningless to expect that the right of appeal in relation to orders under the Act would be available in any other law. The Code of Civil Procedure (Section 104 and Order 43) could not have anticipated the subsequent passage of the Hindu Marriage Act. The narrower view would make it difficult to apply Section 28. Similar language is used in the Indian Divorce Act (Section 55) and the uniform interpretation on that Section is that Act itself creates the right of appeal. The Special Marriage Act (Section 39) also uses similar language and does not seem to have been interpreted differently from the provisions in the Divorce Act.Bhavna Amit Pathakji And 3 Ors. vs Amit Manavantchandra Pathakji, ... on 23 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1247357/ 3","['26', '10','21', '2', '28', '25']"

Since both the above two revisions have been filed against the common order dated 3-7-2010 passed by the 9th Additional Sessions Judge (FTC), Raipur in Sessions Trial No.68/2010, for quashing of the charges framed against the applicants under Sections 304B & 498A of the IPC, they are being disposed of by this common order. 2. As per case of the prosecution, Smt. Kiran Mishra (since deceased) - wife of Rakesh Gautam i.e. applicant No.1 in Criminal Revision No.408/2010, was married to Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 in accordance with her custom. Gouna ceremony was performed in the year 2002. Applicant RakeshRakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26286547/ 1Gautam and other applicants i.e. relatives of Rakesh Gautam - husband of Kiran Gautam, committed torture & cruelty upon Kiran Gautam in connection with demand of dowry and finally Kiran Gautam died on 31-12-2008 in her matrimonial house in abnormal circumstances. Report was lodged, matter was investigated and finally, charge sheet has been filed against the applicants. After hearing the parties, the trial Court has framed charge under Sections 304B & 498A of the IPC against all the applicants i.e. husband of the deceased and relatives of husband of the deceased. 3. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused both the criminal revisions, copy of charge sheet and reply filed on behalf of the State/non-applicant. 4. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that as per case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam (since deceased) was married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 and she committed suicide or she died in abnormal circumstances on 31- 12-2008 after more than seven years of her marriage and, therefore, the trial Court was not competent to frame charge under Section 304B of the IPC. Penal provisions are required to be applied strictly and the Court was under obligation to frame charge in accordance with the provisions of Section 304B of the IPC. In order to frame charge under Section 304B of the IPC, the prosecution is required to show prima facie material that there was valid marriage, the bride died in abnormal circumstances as a result of suicide or bodily injury or burns within seven years of her marriage and she has been subjected to cruelty or torture in connection with demand of dowry soon before her death. In the present case, as per case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam died in abnormal circumstances after more than seven years of her marriage. 5. Learned counsel for the applicants placed reliance in the matter of Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P., Hyderabad v. Tota Basava Punnaiah and others1 in which the High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held that Section 304B of the IPC is a special provision which is inserted by the amendment in 1986 to deal with dowry deaths. It applies where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, if the other conditions i.e. demand of dowry soon before her death and death within seven years of her marriage, are satisfied. Learned counsel further placed reliance in the matter of Baljeet Singh and another v. State of Haryana2 in which the Supreme Court has held that the prosecution is required to establish that the bride died within seven years of her marriage. Learned counsel also placed reliance in the matter of Chhagan v. State of Madhya Pradesh3 in which the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that in case of death of wife after more than seven years of her marriage, no presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short `the Act') would be available. Learned counsel relied upon the matter of Satyabhan Patel v. State of M.P.4 in which the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that for the purpose of presumption under Section 113A of the Act, the date of marriage is the material date and not date of Gouna ceremony. 6. On the other hand, learned State counsel opposes both the revisions and submits that definitely, the prosecution is required to collect sufficient material to show that the bride died within seven years of her marriage in abnormal circumstances and to satisfy the other ingredients of the offence of dowry death. Learned State counsel further submits that the word `marriage' should not be construed in technical or limited sense, `marriage' is the sacred union, legally permissible, of twoRakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26286547/ 2healthy bodies of opposite sexes. In the present case, parties are Hindus and for completion of marriage or solemnization of marriage, parties are required to observe the custom prevailing in their caste or society. Learned State counsel also submits that Gouna ceremony is a part of marriage and marriage only completes after Gouna ceremony and prior to Gouna ceremony there was no occasion of meeting of bride with bridegroom and, therefore, the crucial date for reckoning seven years of marriage in case of social group in which Gouna ceremony is prevalent, is the date of Gouna and not the date of technical marriage. 7. As per the material collected on behalf of the prosecution, available in the charge sheet, bride Kiran Gautam was married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 and her Gouna ceremony was performed in the year 2002. If Gouna ceremony is considered as completion of marriage, charge framed by the trial Court is sustainable under the law and if Gouna ceremony is not considered as essential part of marriage, presumption under Section 113A of the Act would not be available and charge framed against the applicants under Section 304B of the IPC would not be sustainable under the law. 8. Both the parties are Hindus, governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides conditions for solemnization of marriage between Hindus which reads as follows: - ""5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage.-A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:- (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity; (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage; (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;""Rakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26286547/ 3","['11', '5', '30']"

Respondents 1 and 2 contested tho petition after filing separate counters. Both sides let in evidence.

He also directed the second respondent to pay Rs. 500/- as damages and directed the child, iiasva Raju, to be put in the custody of the petitioner. R-2 filed C.M.A. No. 107 of 1962 and R-1 filed C.

For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to in this judgment by their denomination in the lower Court. 3. The petitioner married R-1 in about 1952. The marriage was consummated two years later. As a result of the conjugal life, the male child, Basva Raju, was born to R-1 by the petitioner in the year 1958. From about 1960, the petitioner was working as a mil) labourer in Azam Zahi Mills and living in Warangal. In the same locality, R-2 was residing. He was employed in a Co-operative Society. 4. The contentions in the petition are as follows: From about a year prior to the petition, R-1 began neglecting the petitioner also quarrelling with him on trifling matters and to leave his house wilfully in his absence. The petitioner began to suspect her character and learnt that she had developed intimacy with R-2. The petitioner tried his best to mend the behaviour of R-1, but in vain. One day, the petitioner opened the box of R-1 when the latter was sitting in her bouse, about a month prior to the petition and searched it out of suspicion. He then found kept concealed within the box, tucked up inside the sarees, several photographs which showed both the respondents in a compromising position in different styles and poses. R-2 himself was a photographer. Of these photographs, he filed six with the petition. They are Exs. A.1 to A.6. On recovery of the abovesaid photographs from the possession of R-1, the petitioner demanded an explanation. There was no other go for her except to admit her guilt of her illicit connections with R-2. The abovesaid photographs are sufficient proof of her leading an unchaste life and having sexual intercourse with R-2 who was not admittedly her spouse. She committed acts of adultery with R-2 while living in the house of the petitioner at Karimabad, Warangal. The petitioner wanted to settle the dispute amicably but R-1 went away from the house of the petitioner in the first week of March 1961 in the absence of the petitioner when he was away on duty in the mills sensing that she could not meet the allegations made by the petitioner. From then, she was living with her parents. R-1 wasParimilla Rajalingam vs Akuthota Lingayya And Anr. on 18 November, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1228189/ 1living a life of adultery and, therefore, she was not entitled to keep her child in her custody as the child might be spoiled. R-2, by developing illicit intimacy with R-1 and leading his adulterous life with R-1, has destroyed the peace and harmony of the petitioner's family life and ruined his hearth and home. The petitioner was also defamed in society. Therefore, he was entitled to damages to an extent of Rs. 500/-. 5. R-1 filed a counter contending as follows: The alleged recovery of photos from the possession of R-1 and demanding of explanation and R-1's leading unchaste life are all false. On the evil advice of the petitioner's brother, Rangayya, the petitioner drove away R-1 from his house. At that time, R-1 was in the fifth month of pregnancy. The petitioner was also cruelly ill-treatiug R-1 at the instigation of his brother, Rangayya I and the latter's wife. 6. R-2 filed a counter in which he denied the adultery. He also alleged as follows: ""The petitioner admitting of his wife's behaviour, says that he tried to mend her, but did not take any legal steps. This shows that he himself was conniving at her behaviour. Finally he came forward with this scandalising allegation against this respondent as a result of his failure to be elected as a Municipal Councillor, and because this respondent canvassed against him. But there is absolutely no tint of truth in the allegations. ......Even taking for granted that they are pictures of the respondents, no sane person would expose them that lead to a risk of life and fame. As such, they cannot be admitted to be true for a single moment. Art of photography can do and undo the life and reputation of a person which is unaccomplishable to a common man. It at all the allegation that R-1 was carrying on her immoral relations with this respondent for the last one year living in the house of the petitioner itself and he is actively conniving at it, it means that he never wanted to take any action for reasons better known to himself. A husband conniving the wife's illicit relations with another person cannot apply for a divorce or for any damages from the man alleged to have connections with his wife."" 7. The learned District Judge framed four issues as follows: 1. Is  the  1st     respondent living     in adultery with  respondent-2  and   she  left petitioner's house   in   the   circumstances  stated  by  the petitioner in his petition?  2. Is the petitioner entitled to the custody of child,   Basva Raju?  3. Is  the   petitioner   entitled   to   get   damages and if so how much?  4. To what relief? Parimilla Rajalingam vs Akuthota Lingayya And Anr. on 18 November, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1228189/ 28. Petitioner deposed as P.W. 1 and examined besides two other witnesses who are neighbours. He also marked as Exs. A.1 to A-6, six photographs which he filed with his petition. R-1 and R-2 deposed R. W. 1 and R. W. 2 respectively. They did not examine any other witnesses or mark any documents. P. W. 1 spoke about the facts mentioned in the petition including the seizure of the photographs from the box of R-1. He also deposed to the following effect. One night, the petitioner returned home at about 10-30 p.m. He found the door bolted from inside, knocked at it and asked for its being opened. The door opened. Suddenly, R-2 rushed out of the house through the door and then ran away. P. W. 1 raised a hue and cry. Then the neighbour (P. W. 2) saw R.2 coming out of the house and running away after scaling a dilapidated wall of P. W. 1's house. At that time, the petitioner's mother was in the house but she was old and blind. R-1 left the petitioner's house out of fear. He brought R-1 back from a neighbour's house and questioned her. Subsequently, some days later he searched the box of R-1 and found the photographs (Exs. A.1 to A.6) in it. He complained to R-1's parents. R-1 then went away with the child, Basaya Raju, from the petitioner's house, in the absence of the petitioner, to her parent's house. P. W. 1 showed these photographs to the neighbour (P. W. 2). At that time, R-1 was present. P. W. 2 questioned R-1 about those photographs. R-1 admitted that it was her mistake. The petitioner also showed the photographs to the neighbour (P. W. 3). P. W. 2 had seen R-1 coming out of R-2's house and also met R-2 at a fresh water tap on ten occasions. 9. In her deposition, R-1 as R. W. 1 deposed as follows: She never took photographs with R-2. She had no relations with him. R-2 was a friend of the petitioner and was coming to her house along with the petitioner. The petitioner wanted to marry Sujata who is more handsome than R-1. Therefore, the petitioner has filed this case. The male person in Exs. A-2 and A.3 is R-2 but the woman in Exs. A.1 to A.6 is not R.1. R.1 says so because the photographs have not been taken by her to her knowledge. She did not confess before P. W. 1 as alleged by him. 10. R-2 as R. W. 2 deposed as follows: He visited the house of the petitioner three or four times. On all those occasions, the petitioner himself was present. He went like that as P. W. 1 asked R.2. to canvass for him (P. W. 1) in the elections. In Exs. A.2 and A.3, R.2 is present. The woman seen in Exs. A-1 to A-6 is R-1. He also stated thus: ""In Exs. A-1, A-2 and A-3, I see my photograph. With skill photography, Exs. A.1 to A.4 can be prepared. There is one person by name Satyanarayana at Warangal who knows skill photography. I know photography. If necessary and time is given, I can bring Satyanarayana to say that such skill photographs can be prepared......... I never took R-1's photograph. Unless the photographs of both persons are taken, they cannot be united as in Exs. A.1 to A.4. The photographs of the lady in Exs. A.1 to A.6 is that of R.1, Mallikamba. I cannot say whether a married woman who is not living in adultery will take photographs as in Exs. A.1 to A-6. On seeing Exs. A.1 to A-4 I say that unless the lady is living in adultery she will not permit for such photographs of her being taken.""Parimilla Rajalingam vs Akuthota Lingayya And Anr. on 18 November, 1963 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1228189/ 3",['30']

Vijayakumari And Ors. on 16 August, 1990 Equivalent citations: AIR 1991 Ker 175, I (1991) DMC 323 Author: P Shamsuddin Bench: P Shamsuddin JUDGMENT P.K. Shamsuddin, J. 1. Plaintiffs 1 to 5 in O.S. No. 133 of 1978 on the file of the Court of Addl. Subordinate Judge, Trivandrum, are the appellants. The suit is for declaration of the title of the plaintiffs and the 4th defendant over the plaint schedule property and for an injunction restraining the defendants 1 to 3 from entering into the plaint schedule property and alternatively to recover possession of the property if the Court finds that the 3rd defendant is in possession of the suit property during the pendency of the suit. There is also a prayer for partition of the suit property if the Court finds that the document Ext. 17 dated 13-3-1975 is not void in its entirety. 2. It is the plaintiffs' case that the plaint schedule property was obtained by Adichan Nadar, the father of the 4th defendant, under the partition deed of the year 1079 evidenced by Ext. A-1, that the plaintiffs, the 1st defendant and Santhakumari are the children of the 4th defendant, that they are Hindu Nadars governed by Hindu Mithakshara Law, that the properties obtained by Adichan Nadar devolved on the 4th defendant and he was in possession of the same as Manager of the joint family, and that the plaintiffs obtained right over the properties of the joint family by birth. It was also alleged in the plaint that on 13-3-1975 the 4th defendant representing himself as the sole owner of the property, executed a gift deed Ext. B-7 in respect of the suit property in favour of the 1st defendant, but that document is void as the 4th defendant was incompetent to execute the document for the following reasons: 1. The properties are coparcenary properties and hence the fourth defendant is not competent to execute any document without family necessity or consideration. 2. The gift deed was executed as dowry for the marriage of the first defendant which is prohibited under the Dowry Prohibition Act and therefore no legal right follows to defendants under the document. 3. Even if the 4th defendant had any right to execute the gift deed in respect of the properties within the reasonable limits, he has exceeded those limits in the execution of the document. There were 9 members including the first defendant to be maintained by the 4th defendant at the time of the execution of the gift deed. The family was not in good financial circumstances and many properties were outstanding on mortgage at that time. Besides the execution of the gift deed the 4th defendant has given jewels and utensils worth more than Rs. 10,000/- to the first defendant at the time of her marriage. He has encumbered and alienated many item of immovable properties for meeting the marriage expenses of the first defendant. There was another daughter, San-thakumari, to be married. The status of the family and its poor circumstances were not considered by the 4th defendant when he executed the document.K. Devabalan And Ors. vs M. Vijayakumari And Ors. on 16 August, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1716845/ 14. The plaint schedule property is the best of the entire properties and is yielding an annual income of Rs. 1,000/- by executing the said document the family has been deprived of the best of the properties. The 4th defendant is not competent to execute such a document. The plaintiffs also averred that though the document was executed, the 1st defendant did not get possession of the property, since many relations of the plaintiffs intervened and informed the 4th defendant about the unjust way in which he dealt with the properties, and therefore the 4th defendant subsequently cancelled the gift deed. The plaintiffs as members of the coparcenary are in possession of the property and they were taking income from the property, that when the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants were attempting to execute the sale deed in favour of the 3rd defendant they issued a registered notice to the defendants setting out the fact that the 1 st defendant had no right to the property. Notwithstanding this, defendants I and 2 executed the sale deed in favour of the 3rd defendant on 20-5-1978 and Ext. B-10 is the sale deed. It is the plaintiffs' case that on the strength of Ext. B-10 sale deed, the 3rd defendant was attempting to trespass into the plaint schedule property and the document executed by the 4th defendant had caused cloud of title for the plaintiffs and it was in those circumstances that the suit was filed for a declaration of title and for injunction restraining the defendants from entering into the plaint schedule property. 3. Defendants 1 and 2 filed written statement contending that the plaintiffs and defendants are all Christians and not Hindus, that after the death of Adichan Nadar, the 4th defendant inherited his properties as his only son and that he was in possession of the property as absolute owner and not as the Manager of the joint family. It was also alleged that he embraced Christianity and married a Christian lady by name Mariya Augustina and adopted the name Yesudas and the plaintiffs who were born to the couple are Christians by birth and therefore no question of joint family arose. According to the defendants, the plaintiffs did not get any right by birth and the parties are not Hindus governed by Hindu Mithakshara Law. The 4th defendant being the sole and absolute owner of the property he was competent to execute the document Ext. B-7 and that it was valid and not void as alleged in the plaint. They also averred that the 1st defendant was in possession of the property ever since the date of Ext. B-7 gift-deed and the 3rd defendant got possession after the sale in his favour. According to them the plaintiffs had no possession of any part of the plaint schedule properties and it was the 4th defendant who was conducting the suit behind the planintiffs, and the suit was not maintainable in view of the provisions contained in the Joint Family Abolition Act and in the circumstances the suit is liable to be dismissed. 4. 3rd defendant in his written statement contended that the 4th defendant got himself converted into Christianity before his marriage and the parties are Christians and governed by Christian Succession Act and the 4th defendant who is the sole and absolute owner of the property was competent to dispose of the property as he liked and the gift deed evidenced by Ext. B-7 executed by him in favour of the 1 st defendant is quite valid and does not suffer from any infirmity or illegality. By virtue of the sale deed he got possession of 1 acre and 25 cents out of the plaint schedule property and he paid Rs. 50,000/- as consideration for the sale deed in his favour and he was a bona fide purchaser and the suit was liable to be dismissed.K. Devabalan And Ors. vs M. Vijayakumari And Ors. on 16 August, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1716845/ 25. On a consideration of the evidence in the case, the court below came to the conclusion that there was no valid marriage between the 4th defendant and the mother of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff and the 4th defendant are not Hindus. The court below also found that the plaint schedule property was not absolute property of the 4th defendant and that the property is joint family property. The Court below also held that there is no case for the plaintiffs that the 4th defendant exceeded his limits in executing Ext. B13 settlement deed in favour of his another daughter Santhakumari at the time of her marriage, and in the circumstances of the case it cannot be said that the gift deed evidenced by Ext. B7 exceeded the permissible limits. 6. In this appeal, learned Advocate General has challenged the findings of the court below. Learned Advocate General submitted that there is no issue as to the validity of the marriage between the 4th defendant and Mariya Augustina the mother of the plaintiffs, that none of the parties had a case that the marriage was invalid and the children born were illegitimate and that in the circumstances the court below want beyond the pleadings in finding that there was no valid marriage between the 4th defendant and Mariya Augustina. He also submitted that the Governments evidenced by Exts. A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 and A7 would show that the plaintiffs and the 4th defendant and his brother are all Hindus and the court below went wrong in brushing aside these documents as inadmissible in deciding the question whether the parties were Christians or Hindus. Ext. A2 is the S.S.L.C. look of the 1st plaintiff issued by the Government and it cannot be considered as a record maintained by a private school. Ext. A4 is the admission register relating to the admission of the 4th plaintiff to the school. Ext. A5 is the extract relating to the admission of the 5th plaintiff, Ext. A6 is the extract of the admission register relating to the admission of the 4th defendant to the school and Ext. A7 in the S.S.L.C. Book of Gopalan Nadar, the brother of the 4th defendant. In all those documents admittedly, the plaintiffs 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the 4th defendant and his brother are all shown as Hindus. 7. The court below relied on a decision of a single Judge of this Court in Vijayan v. State of Kerala (1961 KLJ 1007) where it was held that the entry in the admission register of a private school even if it is taken into account is of no help without the evidence of the person who took the boy to the school and signed the application and gave the details recorded in the register. The case referred to above, related to a prosecution under Section 149, I.P.C. There was some difference in the name of the father shown in the charge-sheet and in the extract of the admission register which was sought be pressed into service to prove that the 1st accused was a different person. The 1st accused was correctly identified by the victim and also by other officers and there was no scope for any doubt about identity. 1st accused was described in the charge-sheet as Velikkoth Vijayan, son of Kunhihannan. The 1st accused on his own free will surrendered in court without mentioning a word about the mistake in the description given in the clarge. Even in the committal court the accused did not say a word about his father not being Kunhikannan or that he was not Velikoth Vijayan. It was in that context that this court said that without evidence from the person who took the boy to the school and signed the application and gave the details in the admission register in a private school alone cannot be looked into for the purpose of coming to the conclusion that the accused was not the person who was mentioned in the charge-sheet. In the instant case, the S.S.L.C. book cannot be considered as a document maintained by the private school. The admission registers produced in this case came into existence after the commencement of the Kerala Education Act and the Rules.K. Devabalan And Ors. vs M.

JUSTICE G.S.SISTANI G.S.SISTANI, J (ORAL) 1. Present petition is directed against the order dated 10.03.2010 passed by the Additional District Judge, Delhi, whereby an application filed by the petitioner (husband) under Order 12 Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure for passing a decree of annulment of marriage in view of admission made by the respondent (wife) in the written statement, was rejected. 2. Petitioner was married to the respondent on 14.11.1994 and a male child was born out of their wedlock. The petitioner has filed a petition for grant of divorce under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of cruelty which petition is also pending. Meanwhile, petitioner has filed another petition for grant of decree of nullity under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the alternate under section 12(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act for annulment of marriage on the ground of fraud. 3. According to the petitioner, marriage between the petitioner and the respondent is a nullity since the respondent had a subsisting marriage with one Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna, which was performed in the United States of America. It is submitted that this fact was duly admitted by the respondent in her written statement which was filed to the petition filed by the petitioner herein under Section 13 (i) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty. According to this petition, the petitioner had no knowledge that the marriage of Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna son of Mr.David Boccagna and the respondent was subsisting even at the time of filing of the divorce petition in the trial court. According to the petitioner, the fact regarding the actual marriage of the respondent with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna came to the knowledge of the petitioner after he obtained the certified copy of the decree which was obtained by the respondent from the United States ofMon Mohan Kohli vs Natasha Kohli on 17 January, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125141480/ 1America, which was received by the petitioner through a courier on 12.05.2007. According to the petitioner, the marriage between the respondent and Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna is a subsisting marriage which is borne out of the order of the Matrimonial Court at Florida, United States of America i.e. Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of Florida. In and For Palm Beach County, Juvenile and Family Division, Case No.CD 90-8251 FZ establishing that the respondent continued to be married to Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna. 4. Ms.Luthra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner contends that the said order dated 28.03.1991 shows that the marriage is subsisting and the petition filed by the Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna for divorce/ annulment was dismissed due to non service on the respondent. The petitioner thereafter filed a petition for nullity/ annulment under Section 11 and in the alternate Sections 12(1) (c) of the Hindu Marriage Act, which was filed on 17.07.2007. According to Ms.Luthra, the learned trial court arrived at a finding that the admission i.e. the respondents marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna on the date of marriage to the petitioner (husband) and on the date of filing to the petition for nullity has been adequately made out. The observations made by the trial court in 16 and 17 of the Order have been relied upon and are reproduced below: ""16. Keeping the above principles in mind and after thoughtful consideration of the above contentions, in light of the pleadings of the parties and the record placed, I am of the view that as far as the admission as to the Respondents marriage is concerned, there is enough and adequate admission of marriage between the Respondent and Mr.Boccagna. I also find force in the contentions of the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that the respondent cannot claim that she did not have the details as to the fate of her relationship with Mr.Boccagna or that once she realized about the subsistence of marriage, she had discreetly made efforts for its nullity. As far as the admission as to the marriage with Mr.Boccagna is concerned, there is little doubt that the written statement, itself is redolent of subsistence of marriage with Mr.Boccagna, and the subsequent attempts of the respondent for its annulment under Rule 140 (e) of the Domestic Relations Law, State of New York, goes on show that the respondent had accepted the subsistence of marriage with Mr.Boccagna. 17. Coming now to the contention that whether the admission is specific and unambiguous. I am of the opinion that the requirement of law to the effect that an admission has to be specific, clear, unambiguous and unequivocal, does not depend upon the choice of the words in the pleadings or as to how are the admissions couched in the phrases, but would largely depend upon the subsistence of the pleadings. Admissions may be presented in a circuitous manner, where a party, though admitting the fact, does not wish it to be taken against him, outrightly. The Court, nevertheless, can look into the substance, in order to find out as to whether any other interpretation is possible or whether the explanation, provided by the party against whom such admission is being used, takes the case of the party to such a position, where the Court is rendered of the view that it is not safe to conclude upon the admission, and regardless the fact that admission itself amount to evidence, that the very question demands further corroboration and a higher quotient of evidence.Mon Mohan Kohli vs Natasha Kohli on 17 January, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125141480/ 2A reading of the written statement leaves this court in no doubt as to the fact that as far as the marriage of the respondent with Mr.Boccagna is concerned, the same is clearly admitted by Respondent."" 5. Ms.Luthra, also contends that the admission made by the respondent in her written statement is specific and unambiguous and thus satisfies the ingredients of Order 12 Rule 6 CPC, according to which the admission has to be specific clear, unambiguous and unequivocal. It is submitted that even indirect admissions and admissions made in documents and not specifically in pleadings are to be considered as admissions while disposing of an application under Order 12 Rule 6 of the CPC. It is contended that in view of the admissions made by the respondent there is no room for doubt that the respondent was married to one Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna, at the time of marriage with the petitioner. It is thus contended that since the admission is binding on the respondent, the petitioner is entitled to a decree of nullity. The relevant portions of the written statement filed by the respondent (wife) reads as under: ""As regards her marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna, it is correct that she had been married for a while to the said Mr.Kai Boccagna. The said marriage was nevertheless dissolved. As the marriage with Mr.Kai Boccagna is an episode in the respondents life that is almost 25 years in the past, the exact dates are no longer in the memory of the respondent."" 6. Ms.Luthra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner also submits that the respondent has admitted that she was never a party to any dissolution of marriage, although she had been given to understand by Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna and Mr.David Boccagna that her marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna has been dissolved. It is submitted that such a plea is preposterous as no unilateral dissolution of marriage is known in civil law. She further contends that under the principles of natural justice and in any system of civil jurisprudence, no final order can be obtained by any party against another without giving notice to the said party. It is submitted that there is no explanation as to how the respondent came to such an understanding that her marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna stood dissolved. It is also contended that simply because respondents husband Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna had entered into a bigamous and adulterous relationship with Ms.Caryn D Fillipo, as alleged by the respondent, can be of no benefit to the respondent to categorically establish dissolution of her earlier marriage and further the assurances made by her are patently false and she has committed perjury with impunity, knowing fully well that the marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna was subsisting. 7. It is next contended that after filing of the written statement the respondent indulged in forum hunting and approached the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Westchester County (County Court) in the State of New York, where according to the petitioner, the parties had never resided, by filing a petition for annulment of her marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna under Section 140 (e) of the Domestic Relation Law (DRL) on the ground of non-consummation of marriage. It is also submitted by Ms.Luthra that the said petition was fraudulent and collusive in nature. She further contends that the petition for annulment of her marriage with Mr.Kia Louis Boccagna was filed on 21.11.2007 on the ground of alleged non-consummation of marriage after a gap of 25 years isMon Mohan Kohli vs Natasha Kohli on 17 January, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125141480/ 3","['13', '11', '14']"

Defendants 1 and 4 are the appellants in this appeal. The 1st respondent is the plaintiff and respondents 2 to 4 are defendants 2, 3 and 5. Respondents 2 to 4 viz., defendants 2, 3 and 5 were given up since they remained exparte. 2. The 1st respondent/ plaintiff filed the suit for partition of the suit properties, which are admittedly joint family properties having been allotted to the share of his father (1st defendant) in a partition between him, his brother and their father. The plaintiff's case is as follows: The plaintiff is the undivided son of the 1st defendant. His mother Rajammal/3rd defendant was married to the Ist defendant about 25 years prior to the suit according to the custom obtaining in the community to which they belong. Two sons were born to the 1st defendant through the 3rd defendant. The plaintiff is one of the sons. The other son, who was elder to the plaintiff, died a few months after his birth. 3. The 1st defendant married a second wife. The plaintiff's mother 3rd defendant preferred a complaint against the 1st defendant under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code in C.C. No. 34 of 1960 on the file of the Additional First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, and at the intervention of some mediators, the parties compounded the offence. 4. The 1st defendant obtained from the plaintiff's maternal grand-father/2nd defendant, who purported to act as the guardian for the plaintiff; a document alleged to be a release deed releasing the share of the plaintiff in the joint family properties for a stated consideration of Rs. 2,500. The said document was executed on 31.7.1960 and marked as Ex.A-1. According to the plaintiff Ex.A-1 is void and inoperative in law. The 2nd defendant, grandfather of the plaintiff was neither a de facto nor dejure guardian of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was, at that time, under the care and protection of his mother, the 3rd defendant. In law, the father is the natural guardian and next to him, the mother is the natural guardian, and when both the father and the mother of the plaintiff are alive, the 2nd defendant, who is the maternal grandfather of the plaintiff had no right to act as the guardian on behalf of the plaintiff and execute any document on his behalf. Further there was absolutely no necessity to release the plaintiff's share in the joint family properties much less for a grossly inadequate consideration of Rs. 2,500. 5. The plaintiff would submit that under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 even the natural guardian cannot dispose of the minor's property without the previous sanction of the court. Ex.A-1 executed by the 2nd defendant Subbaraya Gounder, maternal grand-father of the plaintiff, dealing with the plaintiff's share in the joint family properties, is absolutely void under the provisions of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act. Ex.A-1 release deed is void in law and has no legal effect and is non-est. The plaintiff must, therefore, be deemed to be continuing to be a joint family member and must be deemed to be in joint constructive possession of the suit properties, which are joint family properties. In the absence of a release deed, the properties continued to beAthiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A.

The plaintiff issued a notice to the 1st defendant on 6.2.1975 demanding partition and separate possession of his half share in the suit properties. A reply dated 18.2.1975 was sent by the 1st defendant containing false and untenable allegations. 7. The sole defendant Athiappa Gounder filed a petition in I.A. No. 732 of 1979 to implead defendants 2 and 3 as parties to the suit and the said petition was allowed. Defendants 4 and 5, who are the sons of the 1st defendant through one Valliammal, were added as per orders in I.A. No. 105 of 1987 dated 11.3.1987. According to the plaintiff, defendants 2 to 5 are unnecessary parties and they have been added only at the instance of the 1st defendant. 8. The 1st defendant claims that he has married a second wife and through her he has two sons viz., defendants 4 and 5. The plaintiff's mother/3rd defendant gave a complaint of bigamy against the 1st defendant before the Addl. First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, and in that case, the 1st defendant denied having contracted a second marriage. In these circumstances there could not have been any valid marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5 and so, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim to be the legitimate children of the 1st defendant through any valid marriage. Therefore, they are not entitled to any share in the suit properties. Even if there was any marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5, it is not valid in law since the marriage between defendants 1 and 3 was subsisting. Even otherwise, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim any share in the suit properties as per Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act. As per Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, defendants 4 and 5 at best can claim a share in the separate properties of the 1st defendant and not in the joint family properties. So, in any view of the matter, defendants 4 and 5 cannot claim any right or share in the suit properties. Therefore, the plaintiff has filed the suit for division of the suit properties into two equal shares and for putting him in possession of the share so allotted to him and for other reliefs. 9. The 1st defendant, the father of the plaintiff, filed a written statement. The allegations which are necessary for the disposal of the present appeal alone are extracted here. It is true, that the plaintiffs mother the 3rd defendant was married to the 1st defendant about 25 years prior to the suit. But, the said marriage was dissolved in O.P. No. 47 of 1960 on the file of the subordinate. Judge, Salem. The plaintiff is the only son of the 1st defendant. The panchayat regarding C.C. No. 34 of 1960 on the file of the Additional First Class Magistrate No. 2, Salem, is true. The execution of the release deed on 31.7.1960 for Rs. 2,500 is true. The release deed is valid and binding on the plaintiff and the plaintiff cannot now attack the validity of the same after his completing the 25th year. It is only the plaintiff's another who made her father the guardian for the plaintiff and executed the release deed. The plaintiff's suit without a prayer to set aside the release deed is bad. The plaintiff cannot claim a share after 17 years. The 1st defendant's possession of the suit properties all these years as his own openly and to the exclusion of others debars the plaintiff from claiming any share. 10. The 4th defendant filed a separate written statement contending that since the plaintiff has executed a release deed, he is not entitled to any share in the suit properties. The plaintiffs motherAthiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A. Mohan And Ors. on 22 December, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/271594/ 2wanted her father to be the guardian for the plaintiff. So, the plaintiff's maternal grand father Subbaraya Gounder, as guardian of the plaintiff, has executed the release deed after obtaining a sum of Rs. 2,500. The plaintiffs claim for a half share in the suit properties without seeking to set aside the release deed is null and void. Defendants 1,4 and 5 have been enjoying the suit properties and are in possession of the same openly all these years. Defendants 4 and 5 are the sons of the 1st defendant through his second wife. There was a valid marriage between the 1st defendant and the mother of defendants 4 and 5. Therefore, defendants 4 and 5 are entitled to l/3rd share each along with the 1st defendant. The suit is barred by limitation as the plaintiff has not moved the court to set aside the release deed within three years after attaining majority. 11. On the basis of the above pleadings, the trial court framed five, issues. The plaintiff has examined himself as P.W.1 and marked Exs. A-1 to A-3. On the side of the defendants, the 1st defendant examined himself as D.W.1 and two other witnesses were examined on their side besides marking Exs.B-1 to B-3. The learned Subordinate Judge, on a consideration of the entire evidence, has held that Ex.A-1 having been executed by the 2nd defendant, who was not the plaintiff's de jure guardian, was void as per Section 11 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, that there was no need to have it set aside, that despite Ex.A-1, the plaintiff continued to be a member of the joint family and was entitled to a half share since it has not been established that the 1st defendant has married one Valliammal after his marriage with the 3rd defendant was dissolved by a decree of divorce, and that defendants 4 and 5 will not be entitled to any share in the suit property. Consequently, the trial court decreed the suit as prayed for against which the present appeal has been filed by defendants 1 and 4. 12. We have heard the elaborate arguments of Mr. S. Rajasekear for the appellants/ defendants 1 and 4 and Mr. S.P. Subramaniam for the 1st respondent/ plaintiff. Learned Counsel for the appellants reiterated the grounds raised in the memorandum of appeal. He invited our attention to the decisions reported in Kasthuri Lakshmibayamma v. Sabnivis Venkoba Rao , Shanti Parshad v. Kunj Lal A.I.R. 1953 Pepsu 151, Mayilswami Chettiar v. Kaliammal (1969)1 M.L.J. 177, Muppudathi Pillai v. Krishnaswami (1959)1 M.L.J. 225: A.I.R. 1960 Mad. 1 and V. Muthukumara Chetty v. Anthony A.I.R. 1915 Mad 296. Mr. S.P. Subramaniam, learned Counsel for the 1st respondent addressed arguments supporting the judgment of the court below. 13. We have already seen that the plaintiff's claim is sought to be denied on the ground that he had executed the release deed Ex.A-1 dated 31.7.1960 giving up his share in the joint family properties for a consideration of Rs. 2,500. The plaintiffs case is, that the release deed Ex.A-1 is void ab initio. Ex. A-1 (at page 21 of the typed set) has been executed by the 2nd defendant, the maternal grandfather of the plaintiff, in favour of the 1st defendant's father and elder brother. The 2nd defendant was neither de jure nor de facto guardian of the plaintiff at the relevant point of time. 14. Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act provides that the father and after him the mother are the natural guardians. This section runs as follows: 6. Natural guardians of a Hindu minor: The natural guardians of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor's person as well as in respect of the minor's property (excluding his or her undivided interestAthiappa Gounder And Anr. vs A.

The answer to this question is not uniform among various High Courts. A Full Bench of Allahabad High Court and Division Benches of Uttarakhand, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh High Courts have taken the view that such an order is appealable under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act. Quite contrary to the same, the Full Benches of Orissa High Court and Patna High Court and Division Benches of Karnataka, Rajasthan and Bombay High Courts have held that such an order is not appealable to the High Court under Section 19(1) of the Act. 2. So far as this High Court is concerned, thus far, this question has not been examined in detail. But, challenges to these orders are entertained under Article 227 of the Constitution of India [asP.T.Lakshman Kumar vs Mrs.Bhavani on 23 April, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131983212/ 2done in the instant petitions], though, in few instances, appeals have also been entertained. During the course of hearing of these revision petitions, which have been filed challenging the orders passed by the Family Courts under Section 24 of The Hindu Marriage Act, this Court raised a doubt about the maintainability of these petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India since it gave an initial impression that these orders are appealable under Section 19(1) of the Family Courts Act. Therefore, this Court invited the respective counsel to advance arguments, at the first instance, in respect of the maintainability of these revisions. Accordingly, they did. Let me now proceed to consider the same. 3. Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the wife or the husband, as the case may be, who has got no independent income, sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, may apply to the Court for an order for payment of the expenses of the proceeding and the monthly maintenance amount. Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for an appeal against the decrees and orders made under various provisions of the HM Act which reads as follows:- 8. Appeals from decrees and orders-. (1) All decrees made by the court in any proceeding under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), be appealable as decrees of the court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (2) Orders made by the court in any proceeding under this Act under section 25 or section 26 shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), be appealable if they are not interim orders, and every such appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (3) There shall be no appeal under this section on the subject of costs only. (4) Every-appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order. A reading of the above provision would make it clear that sub-section (1) of Section 28 provides for appeal against decrees, whereas, sub-section (2) provides for appeal against orders made under the Act. 4. Under Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13-A and 13-B, the Court passes a decree. These decrees are undoubtedly appealable under sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Act. Under Sections 24, 25 and 26, the Court passes an order. An order made either under Section 25 or 26 is undoubtedly appealable under sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act, provided the said order is not an interim order. In this provision, the Legislature has consciously omitted Section 24. The question, whether an order made under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act by a Civil Court is appealable, came up for consideration on several occasions and the Courts have uniformly held that such an order of the civil court is non appealable.P.T.Lakshman Kumar vs Mrs.Bhavani on 23 April, 2013 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131983212/ 3","['25', '28', '24', '19']"

Mukherjee, J. 1. This is a revisional application filed by the husband petitioner impugning an order No. 8 dated 2-2-94 passed by the learned Additional District Judge. Second Court at Alipore South 24 Parganas (S) in Matrimonial Suit No, 53 of 1993 whereby the learned Trial Judge refused to pass an order straightway on a joint petition filed by both the husband and wife under Order 23 Rule 3 read with Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for dissolution of marriage between the parties on mutual consent. The learned Trial Judge was of the view that a date has to be fixed after six months, from the date of filing of the application since it is a suit for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act and accordingly fixed 3rd August, 1994 for hearing of the petition and for passing appropriate orders. 2. The wife opposite party entered appearance in the matter and submitted inter alia through her learned Advocate that since she was a party to the joint petition filed on 2nd February. 1994, she also wanted a dissolution of the marriage between the parties by a decree of divorce on mutual consent and wanted to have the order impugned dated 2-2-94 as passed by the Trial Judge set aside. 3. The husband filed the suit for dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground inter alia of cruelty both physical and mental against the wife and prayed alternatively for declaration of the marriage as a nullity contending inter alia that the essential ceremonies to a valid Hindu Marriage were not performed and that the marriage certificate was illegal, invalid and of no effect. The wife did not initially contest the suit by filing a written statement and ultimately the suit was transferred by the learned District Judge to the Second Court of the Additional District Judge for ex parte disposal. The learned Additional District Judge fixed 7th January, 1994 for ex parte hearing and ultimately on 2nd February, 1994 to which the matter was subsequently adjourned, the wife filed the written statement along with the show-cause petition and here written statement was accepted by the Court on the cause shown being treated as sufficient for non-filing of the written statement earlier. As and when the wife respondent was so permitted to contest the suit, both the parties filed a joint petition under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for dissolution of the marriage by a decree for divorce on mutual consent and ultimately the learned Additional District Judge was not pleased to pass any order straightway on the application but fixed 3rd August, 1994 for hearing of the suit petition for appropriate orders. 4. It has been submitted by Mr. Milon Mukherjee Advocate appearing in the matter with Mr. T.K. Sen for husband petitioner & Mr. Monish Sen for the wife respondent that the Court was competent to pass an appropriate order on the date of the presentation of the application itself under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act since the words ""not earlier than six months after the date of the presentation of the petition"" was merely directory and not mandatory and if the other criteria wereIn Re: Amitabha Ghosh vs Unknown on 21 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240720/ 1satisfied, the Court ought to have passed a divorce by mutual consent. 5. Reliance was placed before us on various judgments of the Supreme Court and of different High Courts. In Smt. Sureshta Devi v. Om Prakash , it was observed inter alia in paragraph 14 of the said judgment at page 1908 that if the Court held to have the power to make a decree solely based on the initial petition, it negates the whole idea of mutuality and consent for divorce. Mutual consent to the divorce is a sine qua non for passing a decree for divorce under Section 13B. Mutual consent should continue till the divorce decree is passed. It is a positive requirement for the Court to pass a decree of divorce. ""The consent must continue to decree nisi and must be valid subsisting consent when the case is heard"". It is against the background of one of the parties withdrawing the consent before the final date of hearing that the question arose before the Supreme Court to reconcile the conflicting views of the different High Courts on the point, the view taken by the Bombay High Court in Jayasthree Ramesh Londhe v. Ramesh Bhikaji Londhe , the view of the Delhi Court in Smt. Chander Kant a v. Hans Kumar and the view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Meena Dutta v. Anirudh Dutta, 1984(2) DMC 388 that the crucial time for the consent of divorce under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act was the time when the petition was filed, was found by the Supreme Court to be not good law and the Supreme Court ex-pressedly overruled the views expressed in the said decisions. The Kerala High Court in K.I. Mohanan v. Jeejabai reported, , the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Haracharan Kaur v. Nachhattar Singh and Rajasthan High Court in Santosh Kumari v. Virendra Kumar, took a contrary view and held that it is open to one of the spouses to withdraw the consent given to the petition at any time before the Court passes a decree for divorce. That satisfaction of the Court after holding an inquiry about the genuineness of the consent, necessarily contemplates an opportunity for either of the spouses to withdraw the consent. The Kerala High Court in particular has ruled out the application of analogy under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure since it is dissimilar to the situation arising under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Supreme Court in this case held that from the analysis of the provision if Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, it will be apparent that the filing of the petition with mutual consent does not authorise the Court to make a decree for divorce. There is a period of waiting from 6 to 18 months. This interregnum was obviously intended to give time and opportunity to the parties to reflect on their move and seek advice from relations and friends. In this transitional period one of the parties may have a second thought and change the mind not to proceed with the petition. Ultimately one of the spouses may back out and there is nothing in the Section which prevents such a course of action. The Section does not provide that if there is a change of mind, it should not be by one party alone but by both. The Supreme Court expressedly overruled the contention of the different High Courts that the crucial time for giving mutual consent for divorce is the time of filing the petition and not the time when they subsequently moved for divorce decree. 6. it is indeed true that in Dr. (Mrs.) Leena Roy v. Dr. Subrato Roy and Ors., when a joint petition was filed for divorce on mutual consent and filing an application for compromise before the Supreme Court for the custody of the child surreptiously taken away by the father of child from United State of America to India, the Supreme Court filed that since a divorce application was already pending before the City Civil Court at Calcutta in which proceeding also a decree for nullity of marriage granted by an American Court sought by the husband on the ground Inter alia that irretrievable breakdown of marriage was no ground under the Hindu Law, the Supreme CourtIn Re: Amitabha Ghosh vs Unknown on 21 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240720/ 2directed both the parties to file an appropriate application under Order 23 Rule 3 read with Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act before the City Civil Court at Calcutta and directed further that if such an application is filed, the Court will dispose of the application as expeditiously as possible preferably within two weeks from the date of filing of such application, in view of the fact that one of the parties intends to go back to America in connection with her service. It was thereafter that both the husband and wife prayed for an amendment of the original application as filed by the husband so as to convert the original proceeding to a proceeding under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act and thereafter the City Civil Court passed a decree of divorce by mutul consent. Here the facts are entirely distinguishable since the original application as filed by the husband has not been amended suitably so as to convert it into an application under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act but after filing of the written statement, the wife joined the husband in filing a fresh application under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act. 7. The learned Advocates for both the parties cited before us a Division Bench judgment of the Karnataka High Court in Smt. Roopa Reddy v. Prabhakar Reddy where it was held that for considering whether the requirement under Section 13-B is mandatory or directory, the words used in the Section shall have to be read in the context in which the liberalised provision has been made by the legislature enabling the unwilling parties to seek divorce instantaneously and thus to put an end to the untold misery. When the intention of the Legislature in introducing Section 13-B(2) is to liberalise and to unlock the wedlock, the Legislature has never intended the period of six months mentioned in the Act to be strictly complied with. But in spirit the Section is directory in nature and it has been incorporated to held that two discordant spouse to may get quick separation and lead their remaining life without any agony. If Section 13-B(2) is read as mandatory, the very purpose of liberalising the policy of decree of divorce by mutual consent will be frustrated. Thus the Karnataka High Court held that Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act though it is mandatory in form is directory in substance. In the facts of the said case, the wife had filed divorce petition on the ground of cruelty. On appreciation of evidence it was found that both parties were not interested in continuing the marriage. Efforts were made by Court to bring about reconciliation but such attempts proved to be futile. The parties filed a joint application under Order 6 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking amendment to that main petition filed by wife to be converted into one under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce by mutual consent. An application filed under Order 6 Rule 17 C.P.C. was found to be more than six months old and it was treated by the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court as a compromise petition for divorce by mutual consent. The Karnataka High Court Division Bench was of the opinion that since law permits that when the consent is not tainted with mala fides, fraud or coercion but given out of free will and with the knowledge of its consequences, the application presented can be treated as seeking divorce by mutual consent and has to be accepted. In the background of the circumstances it was found that where separation is of a longer period and chances of re-union an impossibility, a decree of divorce is the only prudent course and it was accordingly granted. The distinguishing feature of this case too is that the original application as filed by the wife for divorce on the ground of cruelty was ultimately sought to be converted by an amendment of the plaint to an application under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act.In Re: Amitabha Ghosh vs Unknown on 21 March, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240720/ 3","['13', '13-B']"

The petitioner being the husband of opposite party No. 1 has preferred this revisional application read with Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code praying for setting aside the order dated 24th of August, 1994 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Murshidabad in Misc. Case No. 80(iv) of 1988 whereby there was an award of Rs. 750/ - per month by way of maintenance on an application preferred under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code and the order was given effect to from the date of presentation of the application under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code namely 20th March, 1987. 2. The short history which has given rise to the application under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code is as follows: The marriage between the parties took place on 27th of February, 1985. On 15th February, 1986, the present petitioner challenged the validity of marriage by resorting to a matrimonial suit with a prayer for annulling the marriage under Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act. In March, 1986, the matrimonial suit was transferred to the Court of District Judge at Murshidabad on an application by the petitioner who apprehended physical violence from the opposite party No. 1. On 15th of March, 1987, the District Judge, Murshidabad passed an interim order of alimony at the rate of Rs. 300/ - per month. On 20th of March, 1987, the opposite party No. 1 preferred an application under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Krishnanagar, Nadia praying for maintenance at the rate of Rs. 500/ - per month and also succeeded to get an. ex parte order of interim maintenance at the same rate on the date of filing itself. On 22nd of April, 1988, the interim maintenance passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate was saved by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nadia on the ground that the petitioner was paying alimony to the extent of Rs. 300/- per month in the Matrimonial Suit. The prayer made on the same day by the petitioner for stay of the proceeding under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code was however refused. On 23rd of August, 1988, a move was made before the High Court against the Order dated 22nd of April, 1988, but it was rejected with the observation that the petitioner could take recourse to Section 127, Criminal Procedure Code. On' 31st of August, 1988, the Qistrict Judge, Murshidabad annulled the marriage by decreeing the Matrimonial Suit with the observation that there was concealment of age by the opposite party No. 1 who had practised fraud and deception on the petitioner thereby attracting provisions of Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act. On 20th of November, 1988, after statutory period for preferring appeal was over the petitioner contracted a second marriage. The opposite party No. 1 in the meantime preferred an appeal against the decree in the Matrimonial Suit and got an order of stay from this Court on 20th of April, 1989. On 24th of May, 1989, the opposite party No. 1 filed an application before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nadia for vacating the stay order earlier granted by him but the prayer was refused. A prayer by the petitioner for dropping of proceeding under Section 125, Criminal Procedure Code was however refused by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. Both the petitioner and the opposite party No. 1 moved this Court on 3rd April, 1990 against the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Murshidabad atRampada Biswas vs Dolly Mitra And Ors. on 22 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1471542/ 1the instance of the petitioner. On 10th of July, 1990, the opposite party No. 1 prayed for recall of the order passed by this Court on 3rd of April, 1990 and also for stay of transfer, both of which were rejected. On 24th of August, 1994, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Murshidabad passed an award of maintenance at the rate of Rs. 750/- per month with retrospective effect from 20th of March, 1987 and Rs. 5,000/- towards litigation cost. 3. The grounds taken in the revisional application amongst others are that the Trial Court did not consider the fact that the opposite party No. 1 was a practising Advocate inheriting the Chamber of her father, himself a renowned Advocate apart from other incomes, that the Trial Court relied more on surmises and conjectures than on the materials on record, that a maintenance to the extent of more than the claim of the opposite party No. 1 in her application has been awarded, that the implication of decision in the Matrimonial Suit has not been taken into consider- ation by the Trial Court. 4. The point for determination is whether the impugned judgment of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Murshidabad suffers from impropriety, illegality or incorrect- ness. 5. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner has raised three points, (1) in view of a decree in the Matrimonial Suit preferred by the petitioner against the opposite party No. 1 declaring the marriage as a nullity in view of the contravention of Section 12(l)(c) of Hindu Marriage Act whether the opposite party No. 1 can be called a divorcee as to get maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code. In support of his contention, he relies on two decisions reported in 1996 Cr. LJ 317, K. Sivarama Krishna Prasad v. K. Bharathi &Anr., and also 1982 Cr. LJ 901, being Krishna Gopal v. Usha Rani. Both are Single Bench decisions of Andhra Pradesh High Court and Delhi High Court respectively dealing with the maintainability of application under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code if the marriage was annulled by a decree in terms of Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The second point argued is that there is no positive finding that there was neglect or refusal by the petitioner to maintain the wife and that the opposite party No. 1 is unable to maintain herself. The third argument is that since the amendment of Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code raising the maximum quantum of maintenance from Rs. 500/- to Rs. 1,500/- per month came into existence on 22nd of April, 1993, the Chief Judicial Magistrate made an error in granting retrospective maintenance and that also at the rate of Rs. 750/- per month w.e.f. 20th March, 1987 when the maximum quantum was Rs. 500/-. . 6. The learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party No. 1 so far as the first point is concerned submitted that the decree in the Matrimonial Suit has not attained finality since the opposite party No. 1 has preferred an appeal in this Court and has also got an order of stay from the Appellate Court. Regarding the second point, he argues that maintenance at a rate of Rs. 500/- per month would not have been sufficient. He also relied on a decision reported in 75 Cal. WN 932. Regarding the third point the learned Advocate fairly conceded the legal position taken by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. 7. I have given my careful consideration to the submission of both the sides and have also scrutinised the decisions placed at the Bar and also the impugned order of the Chief JudicialRampada Biswas vs Dolly Mitra And Ors. on 22 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1471542/ 2Magistrate, Murshidabad which on the face to it is exhaustive in nature. The legal position so far as the right of divorced wife to get maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code has practically been crystallised. The Hindu Marriage Act speaks of a decree in connection with a Hindu Marriage on a number of circumstances. As a matter of fact, there may be a decree for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. There can also be a decree for judicial separation in terms of Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. There may be decree passed in accordance with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act declaring a marriage as null and void. There may be a decree under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act where the marriage was otherwise valid but due to the presence of the ground mentioned in the said section it could be declared as void at the instance of one of the parties to the marriage. There may also be a decree of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act at the instance of either of the parties for contravention of the different provisions mentioned in the said section. While an application under Section 25(1) maintain- able by either party to the marriage and the Court having jurisdiction can pass an order under the section either at the time of passing the decree or at any time subsequent thereto, the scope of an application under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code is not so wide. Such an application is obviously guided by Section 125(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code since in case of husband and wife it can be preferred by the wife which includes a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not re-married. Thus a wife during the continuance of a valid marriage as also a divorcee in terms of the explanation given in Clause (b) to Section 125(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code are eligible to maintain an application under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. By implication in the event of a marriage being declared null and void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act or in the event of a marriage having been annulled in terms of Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act an application under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code at the instance of the wife is not maintainable. 8. In the present case it is no doubt true that the marriage between parties has been annulled by a decree passed under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act on 31st of August, 1988 but the admitted position is that the wife has preferred an appeal before this Court and has also obtained an order of stay of the decree appealed against. Therefore, in the eye of law the petitioner and the opposite party No. 1 are still husband and wife so as to claim maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code provided other conditions relating to granting of main- tenance are satisfied. That concludes that first branch of argument. 9. So far as the neglect or refusal on the part of the petitioner to maintain the lawfully married wife or the inability on the part of the opposite party No. 1 to maintain herself is concerned the matter has been discussed elaborately by the Trial Court. So far as the first part is concerned there is the allegation of torture which has been believed by the Trial Court. Regarding the second part, it is also the finding of the Trial Court that the income made by the opposite party No. 1 from the profession is not sufficient for her livelihood in view of her inability to have a footing in the legal profession. Therefore, these being questions of fact which have been decided on the available evidence on record by the Trial Court and there being no infirmity in drawing the conclusion, this Court will not interfere by way of revision.Rampada Biswas vs Dolly Mitra And Ors. on 22 December, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1471542/ 3","['10', '13', '12', '9', '11', '25']"

JUDGMENT Dharmadhikari B.P., J. 1. Very small issue falls for consideration of this Court, hence, Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith and heard finally by consent of parties. 2. The challenge in this petition under Articles 226 and 227 of Constitution of India is to the order dated 2-4-2004 passed by 2nd Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Akola in Special Civil Suit No. 143/2003. By the said order, the learned trial Court has rejected the application, Exhibit-19 which was preliminary objection to the tenability of suit filed by present petitioner/husband. Necessary facts in this respect can be briefly summarized as under: 3. The above mentioned RCS 143/2003 is filed by present respondent, a divorced wife of petitioner, under Section 18 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act read with Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act for grant of maintenance. By the said application, she has stated that she is married with petitioner and their marriage took place on 27-2-1994. By prayer clause, she has asked for a decree of past arrears of maintenance of Rs. 1,08,000/- and a direction to pay and to continue to pay Rs. 3,000/- as maintenance every month in future. The petitioner appeared in response to the said suit and filed his written statement. In his written statement he has pointed out that he had filed Hindu Marriage Petition No. 72/2001 before the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, at Kalyan for dissolution of marriage under Section 13(l)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act and the said Court allowed his petition by its judgment dated 30th January, 2002 and accordingly the marriage between them is already dissolved. He further pointed out that in such circumstances, the Civil Court at Akola, which has taken cognizance of RCS No. 143/2003 had no jurisdiction and the matted ought to have been filed before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, at Kalyan, who granted the decree of divorce. 4. It appears that on 12-3-2004 the petitioner, filed a preliminary objection and pointed out that the Court at Akola had no jurisdiction and the proceedings ought to have been filed before Kalyan Court under Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act. The learned trial Court has considered said preliminary objection (Exhibit 19) and has rejected it on 2-4-2004. 5. I have heard Advocate C.A. Joshi for petitioner/husband. By placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court reported at 1983 Mh.L. J. 754, Jagdish Premji Ruparel v. Bhanumati Jagdish Ruparel, he contends that it is only the Court at Kalyan which had jurisdiction to take cognizance of application under Section 25. He contends that the learned Court below has not followed the law correctly. He contends that Section 19 of Hindu Marriage Act is considered by this Court and the Court has found that Section 25 is worded differently and jurisdiction to entertain application under Section 25 is given to the Court exercising jurisdiction at the time of passing of any decree or at any time subsequent thereto. He states that Section 19 speaks of petitions to be filed under Hindu Marriage Act and relies upon the observations of learned Single Judge, as contained in para Nos. 16,Nagorao Onkar Tayade vs Ranjana Nagorao Tayade on 14 October, 2004 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1433345/ 117 and 18 of that judgment. The said observations read as under : ""16. 1 am unable to agree with the contention of the non-applicant-wife that the word ""any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act"" could be referable to the one defined in Section 19 of the Act. In fact, I feel that the word ""any Court"" is used advisedly to include any Court within the definition of Section 13-B. However, once a petitioner for substantive relief is filed in one of the courts who have jurisdiction to deal with the substantive relief as defined under Section 19, then the consequential relief under sections 24, 25 and 2G have to be sought for only from the Court exercising jurisdiction at the time of passing a decree or subsequent thereto. 17. It also cannot be lost sight of that Hindu Marriage Act is a special Legislation codifying the ancient Hindu Law. The object of condification of the particular branch of law is that on any matter specifically dealt with by it, the law should be sought for in the codifying enactment itself. Thus, apart from other enactment, such as Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, where Section 18 also gives a right to a Hindu wife to claim maintenance, the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 will have to be strictly dealt with under that Act and not under any other law. Since in my view, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act itself prescribes the forum before which the consequential relief of permanent alimony is to be secured, no reference to Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act is necessary, particularly when it only refers to petition under the Act viz. those governed by sections 9 to 13-B. 18. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it is apparent that for filing a petition for substantive relief, the Court at Nagpur as well as at Sambalpur had jurisdiction to deal with the matter. However, the decree for dissolution of marriage has been passed by the Court at Sambalpur and it is that Court which at the time of passing a decree or subsequent thereto could also grant the consequential relief of permanent alimony under Section 25 by an application made to it. The Court at Nagpur even though it has original civil jurisdiction to deal with the substantial matrimonial relief, cannot be approached for the consequential relief of permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Act. The Court at Sambalpur alone can deal with that subject in the facts and circumstances of the case."" 6. As against this, Advocate Mardikar appearing for respondent/wife states that the wife is residing with her parents at Akola and, therefore, she can maintain the proceedings at Akola. He points out that proceedings filed by him are also under Section 18 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. He contends that Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act has application only when the Court passes a decree in proceedings under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act. According to him, right of respondent/wife to claim maintenance under Section 18 is not affected by said Section 25. He relied upon the judgment of this Court reported at 2002(Supp.) Bom.C.R. (A.B.)644 : 2002(2) Mh.L.J. 53, Panditrao Chimaji Kalure v. Gayabai Panditrao Kalure, and Apex Court ruling reported at 1993(Supp.) Bom.C.R. (S.C.)487: 1993 Mh.L.J. 1731, Chand Dhawan v. Jawanharlal Dhawan. 7. The arguments of Advocate Mardikar about scope of Section 25 need not detain this Court more because here it is an admitted position that the marriage between the parties has been dissolved by the competent Court at Kalyan under the provisions of Section 13(l)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act. TheNagorao Onkar Tayade vs Ranjana Nagorao Tayade on 14 October, 2004 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1433345/ 2argument that if marriage is dissolved in any other manner, which is not prescribed under the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act about the bar of jurisdiction relied upon by petitioner, is not applicable, therefore, has no relevance in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In so far the ruling reported at 2002(2) Mh.L.J. 53, is concerned, in that case, the defendant/husband filed written statement contending that he had divorced his wife by executing a Divorce deed on 5-5-1967 as per prevailing customes. It appears that the trial Court there granted maintenance of Rs. 60/- per month to the wife and husband preferred No. 88/1975 before the District Judge. The learned District Judge remanded the matter back to the trial Court to find out whether marriage between the parties was subsisting on the date of filing of the suit. It appears that thereafter the learned lower Court recorded the evidence and sent the matter to District Court and the District Court found that there was a divorce deed between the parties as per the customary practice. The learned District Judge thereafter considered the issue of grant of maintenance and found that petition for maintenance under Section 18 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1959 can be considered even under Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Single Judge, after hearing both the sides, found that one a wife is divorced, her remedy is to seek maintenance under Hindu Marriage Act and not under Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. Para 23 of the said judgment is relevant and it reads as under: ""I have heard both the learned Counsel at length, with regard to the aforesaid two substantial questions of law raised by Mr. Milind Patil, appearing on behalf of the appellant in Second Appeal No. 73/1984. The judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Chand Dhavan (supra) makes it abundantly clear that Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act operates in a different level and the marriage has to be subsisting and in that case, the marriage was subsisting. In any event, in view of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Chand Dhawan (supra) there is absolutely no ambiguity. There is no question of interchangeability, the same cannot be permitted so as to destroy the distinction on the subject of maintenance. Therefore, once a wife is divorced, her remedy to seek maintenance is at the time of divorce in a matrimonial petition or subsequent thereto is only under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and she cannot have any recourse under Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, in as much as, the precondition for application of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, for a wife to seek maintenance is that the marriage must be subsisting. Under these circumstances, I answer the first substantial question of law to the effect that a divorced wife cannot claim any maintenance under Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, and her only remedy is under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955."" 8. Advocate Mardikar has also relied upon the judgment of Apex Court, reported at 1993 Mh.L.J. pg 1731 (supra). This ruling is considered in above referred judgment and it also does not help the present respondent/wife. Portion of para No. 23 of the said judgment is relevant which reads as under: ""So while sustaining her marriage and preserving her marital status, the wife is entitled to claim maintenance from her husband. On the other hand, under the Hindu Marriage Act, in contrast, her claim for maintenance pendente lite is durated on the pendency of a litigation of the kind envisaged under sections 9 to 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and her claim to permanent maintenance or alimony is based on the supposition that either her marital status has been strained or affected byNagorao Onkar Tayade vs Ranjana Nagorao Tayade on 14 October, 2004 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1433345/ 3","['18', '13', '19', '13-B', '25']"

DATED : 23rd        February, 2010 ORAL ORDER :Rakesh Harsukhbhai Parekh vs State Of Mah on 23 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1681202/ 1    1.Rule, returnable forthwith.     2.The   Petitioner   and    Respondent     No.2       are       husband           and wife. They married on 20.5.2005. They started living separately since 19.5.2006. The Petitioner-husband filed a Petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce on the ground of cruelty of Respondent No.2 on 12.6.2007. After part evidence was recorded in the Petition, the parties settled their dispute. They withdrew allegations against one another and filed Consent Terms on 16.12.2009 with regard to the grant of divorce for withdrawal of the allegations and the grant of lump sum alimony to the wife. Thereafter they made a joint application for waiver of the 6 months period for acting upon the Consent Terms and obtaining a divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act on 14.1.2010. Their application has come to be rejected on the ground that the period cannot be waived and that the Petition has to be adjourned for 6 months. 3.Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is in respect of dissolution of a marriage by a decree of divorce on the grounds stated therein. Consequently, under that section upon proof of any of the grounds the marriage could be dissolved by decree of divorce. 4.Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act is in respect of dissolution of a marriage by decree of divorce upon a Petition presented to the District Court by both parties to a marriage together on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more and that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. 5.Under Section 13B(2), the Court is required to pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved upon the motion of both the parties made after 6 months of the presentation of the Petition and within 18 months thereof. 6.It is on the premise that the application for divorce by mutual consent which came to be treated as a Petition for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Act, the learned Judge in the impugned order did not grant the divorce but observed that the Petition had to be adjourned for 6 months mandatory period. It must be appreciated that Section 13B was by the Amendment Act 68 of 1976 enacted to allow the parties to file Petitions for divorce by mutual consent upon the grounds stated therein which are that they are living separately and are not able to live together. Section 13B contemplates a Petition initially filed by the parties. It would be filed upon the premise that the parties have decided that they could not and hence have not lived together but have lived separately. 7.The provision under Section 13B(2) is the respite period granted to such parties to reconsider their decision to dissolve their marriage. The provision lays down what a Judge is required to do if the Petition is not withdrawn before 6 months to 18 months statutory period when it remains on the file of the Court. If a Petition under Section 13 has remained on the file of the Court for as long as 3Rakesh Harsukhbhai Parekh vs State Of Mah on 23 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1681202/ 2years as in this case, the parties require no respite period to reconsider their decision to dissolve a broken marriage in which various allegations based upon the grounds under Section 13 have been made and later withdrawn upon seeing reason. 8.The Court must further consider Section 9 of the Family Courts Act,1984, which enjoins the Family Court to consider the alternative mode of reconciliation between the parties. A reconciliation may be positive in which case parties may come together as husband and wife. If not, reconciliation by way of amicable settlement of their dispute by divorce could also be arrived at. 9.Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), which applies to the Family Court since it is the Civil Court under Section 10(1) of the Family Courts Act, further enjoins the Court to follow the resolution of the dispute by an alternative mode, including the mode of mediation. If that is followed, the parties would settle their dispute and withdraw the allegations and if in the meantime a period of 6 months has transpired, the statutory period of respite is availed of by the parties. Consequently, the literal interpretation of Section 13B(2)of the Hindu Marriage Act would not be required in case of parties filing Consent Terms and withdrawing the allegations against one another after a Petition for divorce has been filed more than 6 months prior to such withdrawal of allegations and filing of Consent Terms thereunder, be it under Section 13 and not under Section 13B of the Act. 10.The learned AGP appearing for Respondent No.1-State tenders a judgment in the case of Anil Kumar Jain vs. Maya Jain, II (2009) DMC 449 (SC) in which the Supreme Court allowed such a Petition to be granted under its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The order of the Family Court has not been challenged on the ground that it could be passed under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Even this Court cannot and is not passing an order under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. However, upon a harmonious construction of the aforesaid provisions of the Family Courts Act, the CPC and the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it can be seen that the period of respite is not required to be waived . It is the period which has passed when the Petition was pending under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is only upon conversion of that Petition under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act that the Petition filed on the grounds of cruelty making allegations of cruelty is converted into a Petition where the allegations stand withdrawn upon the parties having settled their disputes. 11.The parties, who settle their dispute, are not required to be penalised for settling their disputes. They have gone through the process of divorce in the Court for more than 6 months when the Petition remained pending. They have only modified their views upon settlement of the dispute. Hence such a Petition, though for divorce by mutual consent which would be granted to both parties and not for divorce upon the grounds under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, has lived through 6 months period in the Family Court already. Consequently, that period of 6 months, which the law requires the parties to undergo while the Petition remains pending, is undergone; only the acrimonious allegations are withdrawn so that the divorce can be granted amicably to both rather than to one of the spouses.Rakesh Harsukhbhai Parekh vs State Of Mah on 23 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1681202/ 3","['9', '13', '10']"

The fact of the case in short was that the opposite party preferred a petition under section 125 Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate, Ist class, Jamshedpur which was registered as Misc. Case No. 30 of 1988 and the same was allowed in terms of the order dated 24.7.1993 asking the petitioner to pay Rs.. 350/- per month since 24.7.1993. 3.

Case No. 167 of 2005 and after considering the claim of the opposite party herein and the rejoinder of the petitioner, passed the order allowing the maintenance amount at the enhanced rate which was challenged by the petitioner in Cr.

In view of the provisions where such enhancement has been granted, the matter is remitted back to the Family Court, Jamshedpur to consider all these points of law without being prejudiced by the order of this Court and whether the opposite party is entitled of any maintenance specifically to the enhanced amount or not With the aforesaid observation and directions, this revision stands disposed of."" 4 pursuant to such observation of this Court, the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jamshedpur by a detailed order dated 26.7.2008, which is impugned herein, upheld his earlier order and thereby directed the petitioner to pay the maintenance amount to the tune of Rs. 3,000/- per month to the opposite party w.e.f. 4.10. 2007 which has been challenged in the present Cr.Revision on the ground that provision of Section-127 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be appreciated by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jamshedpur in its right perspective which speaks :- ""Where it appears to the Magistrate that, in consequence of any decision of a competent civil court, any order made under section 125 of Cr.P.C. should be cancelled or varied, he shall cancel the order or, as the case may be, vary the same accordingly."" 5. The petitioner appearing in person admitted that he had filed a petition under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before Principal Subordinate Judge, Vishakhapatnam vide O.P. No. 107 of 1988 on 5.10.1999 for restitution of conjugal rights and the respondent-opposite party herein had only once appeared. During the process of reconciliation proceeding the opposite party refused to join the society of the petitioner and for that she had assigned no reason for doing so, though, as a matter of fact he (petitioner) should have preferred a petition under section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 for declaration of their marriage void ab initio. The law as contained in Section 125(4) of Cr.P.C. as quoted below gives a guide line which speaks :- ""No wives shall be entitled to receive an allowance for the maintenance or the interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be, from her husband, under this section, if she is living in adultery or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband or if they are living separately with mutual consent."" 6. The petitioner submitted that even then the opposite party refused to join his society. Thereafter, the petitioner preferred a suit under section 13(1)(i)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking a decree of divorce as against the respondent-wife which was allowed and decreed vide Judgment dated 8th February 1996. While disposing of the petition filed under section 13(1)(i)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, the learned Judge, Family Court at Visakhapatnam observed :- ""Admittedly, the respondent has filed maintenance case and interim maintenance was also granted and the same is being paid by the petitioner herein .The petitioner has to pay the maintenance as per provision of law under sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and respondent did notShri Vasamsetti Vishnu Pothana @ ... vs Smt.Anasuya on 27 July, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1394493/ 2adduce any evidence in this regard for claiming anything. Thereafter he is liable to comply with the order of maintenance after due enquiry"". 7. The petitioner interpreted that the order passed under section 125 or under section 127(1) of Cr.P.C. by the Principal Judge, Family Court, jamshedpur was not maintainable in view of the judgment made by the Judge, Family Court at Visakhapatnam in O.P. No. 625 of 1995 under section 13(1)(i)(b) of the Hindu Marriage Act wherein it was observed in explicit words that the petitioner had to pay maintenance as per provision of law under sections 24/25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 but the respondent-wife did not prefer any petition under the said provisions for interim maintenance or otherwise and that she was entitled to maintenance only after due enquiry under sections 24/25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and not under the provisions of section 125 or under section 127(1) of Cr.PC. at the enhanced rate. Finally the petitioner submitted that the Judgment passed and decree prepared by the Judge, Family Court at Visakhapatnam in O.P. No. 625 of 2005 shall prevail over the order impugned dated 26.7.2008 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jamshedpur in Misc.Case No. 167 of 2005 by which maintenance to the tune of Rs. 350/- was enhanced to Rs. 3,000/- per month putting heavy monetary burden upon the petitioner to pay to the opposite party Smt Anasuya on monthly basis. 8. The learned counsel Mr. Prabhat Kumar Sinha appearing on behalf of the Opposite party Smt.Anasuya submitted that the petitioner has imputed allegations after allegations against the Principal Judge, Family Court Jamshedpur by assailing the order impugned dated 26.7.2008 by which maintenance amount earlier granted to the opposite party Smt. Anasuya was enhanced from Rs. 350/- to Rs. 3000/- per month upon consideration of her petition filed under section 127(1) of Cr.P.C. in the back drop of changing circumstances as also upon the remand order passed in Cr.Rev.No. 941 of 2007 by this Court on 29.11.2007.The learned Counsel pointed out that the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Jamshedpur by a detailed order dated 26.7.2008 reconsidered the matter and maintained his earlier view of enhancement. The petitioner had admitted in O.P. 625 of 1995 that Hindu Marriage was solemnized between him and the opposite party Smt. Anasuya on 9.10.1986 which was dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground of desertion and that in the said O.P. 625 of 1995 opposite party Smt. Anasuya was denied opportunity to plead that there was valid marriage between the parties and that the valid marriage was precondition for passing a decree of divorce. The learned counsel contended that it was the petitioner who had deserted the opposite party Smt. Anasuya and during such period of desertion the petitioner solemnized second marriage before their marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce and for such reason opposite party was not inclined to live with him. The order impugned, therefore, passed under section 127(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not call for interference for want of any order under sections 24/25 of the Hindu Marriage Act in favour of the opposite party herein. 9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I find the short question that has been raised in the instant Criminal Revision is as to whether the order impugned dated 26.7.2008 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Jamshedpur in Misc. Case No. 167 of 2005 under section 127(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure calling upon the petitioner to pay maintenance at the enhanced rate of Rs.3000/- per month is maintainable in view of the observation made by the JudgeShri Vasamsetti Vishnu Pothana @ ... vs Smt.Anasuya on 27 July, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1394493/ 3",['12']

These two Appeals are directed against the common Judgment passed by the Family Court, in two proceedings initiated before it under the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act, in respect of the custody of one Varun, a minor child. G & W.C. No. 73/87 was filed by the grand-parents of the said Varun to appoint them as guardians of their grand-child and G & W.C. No. 75/87 was filed by the father of the said Varun to get custody of his son. The first Petition came to be dismissed and the second Petition came to be allowed and therefore, the grand-parents who happen to be the petitioners in the first Petition and respondents in the second Petition have preferred these Appeals. 2. The evidence has been recorded in the first petition G & W.C. No. 73/87 and in the lower Court the parties have been referred to by virtue of the ranks they had occupied in the 1st Petition. For the sake of convenience we will also adopt the same course of reference to the parties, by virtue of their ranks occupied in G & W.C. No. 73/87 or by virtue of their relationship as occasion may demand. 3. Certain factual events leading up to the filing of the Petitions are practically undisputed, though the parties are at variance in respect of the cause or reasons which led upto the said events. We would in the first instance refer to the undisputed events. Usha the daughter of the petitioners was married to the respondent on 15-7-79. Both the respondent and his wife Usha lived together at Calcutta where the respondent was working during the said time till 23-12-79, on which date she left her matrimonial home to Bangalore to reside with her parents. By that time she had become pregnant and on 7-7-80 she gave birth to Varun a male child. Both Usha and her husband respondent filed a joint Petition for divorce by mutual consent in the Court of the City Civil Judge, Bombay, in M.J.P. 844/82. On 29-4-82 the Bombay City Civil Court passed the order. It reads: ""The Petitioner No. 1 Kongot Ravindran Unni and the Petitioner No. 2 Usha Ravindran Unni jointly pray for a decree of divorce dissolving their marriage solemnized on the Fifteenth day of July one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine at Guruvayurappan Temple, Asthika Samaj, Matunga, Bombay, according to the Hindu Verdict Rites and for an order that the custody of the minor child named Varun do remain with the Petitioner No. 2 and that the Petitioner No. 1 be permitted to see and visit the said minor child at the residence of the Petitioner No. 2 whenever the Petitioner No. 1 desires to do so after giving adequate notice of the date and time of his intended visit to the residence of the Petitioner No. 2 to see the child and for a declaration that the Petitioner No. 2 gives up her claim permanently for the maintenance and/or alimony for herself and for the said minor child Varun and for such other and further orders and directing as may be just equitable and necessary in the circumstances of the case and the Petition being this day called on for hearing and final disposal, the Petitioners appearing by Advocate and upon the Advocate for the Petitioners tendering the Affidavit of the Petitioner No. 1 Kongot Ravindran Unni, herein dated the Nineteenth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty two the affidavit of the Petitioner No. 2 UshaMadhavan Nair vs Ravindran Unni on 10 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36456/ 1Ravindran Unni herein dated the Fifteenth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty two reaffirming the consent of the Petitioner to the divorce and applying that the same may be taken on file and upon the said Advocate for the Petitioners stating that the Petitioners have been living separately for a period of more than one year before the date of filing of the Petition that the consent of the Petitioners to the divorce continues and that neither of the Petitioners has withdrawn their consent AND UPON READING the said Affidavits of the Petitioner No. 1 herein dated the Nineteenth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty two and the Petitioner No. 2 herein dated the Fifteenth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty two AND THIS COURT BEING SATISFIED that the consent of the either of the Petitioners has not been obtained by force, fraud or undue influence THIS COURT DOTH PASS JUDGMENT for the Petitioners AND DOTH ORDER AND DECREE that the marriage between the Petitioner No. 1 Kangot Ravindran Unni and the Petitioner No. 2 Usha Ravindran Unni solemnized on the Fifteenth day of July one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine at Guruvayurappan Temple, Asthika Samaj, Matunga, Bombay according to the Hindu Vedic Rites be and the same is hereby dissolved on the ground of mutual consent of the Petitioners herein, AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the custody of the minor child Varun shall remain with the Petitioner No. 2 AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the Petitioner No. 1 be and he is hereby permitted to see and visit the said minor child Varun at the residence of the Petitioner No. 2, whenever the Petitioner No. 1, desires to do so after giving adequate notice of the date and time of his intended visit to the residence of the Petitioner No. 2 to see the said child."" (underlining by us) As can be seen from the contents of the order there was a decree dissolving the marriage between Usha and the respondent and further an order was passed giving custody of the child Varun to Usha with visiting rights to the respondent. Afterwards, the child was in the custody of Usha till February 1984, when she died of cancer. Thereafter, the said Varun is in the custody of its grand-parents the petitioners. Usha during her life time created a trust for the benefit of her son Varun and she also left a Will appointing her parents as guardians of her son and the said Will came to be probated. Thereafter, the two Petitions referred to already have been filed by the grand-parents as also the father, before the Family Court, Bangalore, 4. On behalf of the petitioners their learned Advocate Mr. Rego advanced the following contentions: (1) It was contended that in view of the fact that the City Civil Court, Bombay at the time of dissolution of the marriage of Usha with the respondent had passed orders regarding custody of Varun under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, if any party wants any further orders regarding custody of Varun, he was to approach only that Court under Section 26 and in that view of the matter, both the petitions filed before the Family Court, Bangalore were not maintainable and deserve to be dismissed. (2) That the Petition filed by the respondent under Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, is not maintainable because even on the very undisputed facts, he did not have custody of the ward Varun at any time and therefore, there could be no question of the ward leaving or being removed from the custody of the guardian within the meaning of Section 25 of the said Act.Madhavan Nair vs Ravindran Unni on 10 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36456/ 2(3) That the petitioners have been appointed as the testamentary guardians of minor Varun by Usha to whose custody the child was given as per the orders passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, and therefore, there is no question of Varun being removed from the custody of the guardian within the meaning of the said Section 25. (4) That, right from the beginning, the respondent father had not evinced any kind of interest in the minor child and every since the birth, the child has been living with its grand-parents and it has also expressed its desire to continue with the grand-parents and irrespective of the rights of the parties, having regard to the paramount consideration of the welfare of the minor child, custody should be continued with the grand-parents. 5. The grand-parents had not raised any point relating to jurisdiction before the Family Court and even in the course of the Memorandum of Appeal, they had not put forward any such ground but nevertheless, as it is a pure question of law, they were permitted to raise an additional ground in that regard for the first time before this Court. 6. We will take up for consideration the point pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Family Court to entertain these Petitions. Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, under which orders were passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, giving custody of minor Varun to Usha reads as hereunder: ""In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree upon application by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending, and the Court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made."" Under this provision, the City Civil Judge, Bombay, had the necessary jurisdiction to pass the order giving custody of Varun to its mother has not been disputed. A mere look at the Section itself would indicate that even after decree, the very same Court before whom the proceeding has been initiated under this Act, is entitled to pass such orders with respect to the custody and maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree as if the proceedings culminating in the decree are still pending. Therefore, the City Civil Judge, Bombay, before whom the divorce proceedings were initiated by the consent petition of both Usha and her husband respondent could also pass appropriate orders regarding custody and other aspects pertaining to the minor even after the decree, as if the proceeding was still pending. Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act which refers to the overriding effect of this Act reads as hereunder:- ""Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act.- (a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to anyMadhavan Nair vs Ravindran Unni on 10 April, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36456/ 3","['4', '26', '25']"

Lakshmanan, J. 1. Heard Mr. M. Vanchinathan learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.P. Mani, learned counsel for the respondent. This revision is directed against the order dt. 8.4.96 in I.A.No. 114 of 1995 in H.M.O.P.No. l9 of 1995 on the file of the Subordinate Judge, Chidambaram awarding interim maintenance pendente lite at Rs. 500 p.m. to the respondent herein and Rs. 250 for the minor daughter and a sum of Rs. 2,000 for litigation expenses. 2. The respondent herein filed H.M.O.P.No. l9 of 1995 for divorce under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage, Act 1955. Pending final disposal of the main OP., the respondent herein filed I.A.No. 114 of 1995 claiming interim maintenance for herself and for her daughter at Rs. 3,000 p.m. and for litigation expenses at Rs. 7,000. 3. The petitioner resisted that application contending inter alia that the allegation that the respondent was treated cruelly by him is not true and on the other hand, respondent has been cruel to him and that application filed for the maintenance pendente lite is not sustainable cither on facts or in law since the maintenance can be awarded to the wife or to the husband as the case may be, in a case of this kind. Further the respondent's family is in affluent circumstances and that there is no necessity to grant any maintenance pending decision of the main O.P. It is also contended that the maintenance if at all can be granted only to the wife and not for the daughter and at any rate, the sum awarded at Rs. 500 for herself and at Rs. 250 for the minor daughter is too high. 4. The learned subordinate Judge, Chidambaram passed an order granting interim maintenance at Rs. 500 per month for the respondent herein and Rs. 250 p.m. to the minor daughter from the date: of the application till date of the disposal of the main O.P. and a sum of Rs. 2,000 towards legal expenses to the respondent herein. Aggrieved by the said order, the husband has filed this revision in this court which was admitted on 15.7.1996. 5. The petitioner mainly contended that the court below has failed to note that Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act contemplates maintenance pendente lite to only one of them either the husband or the wife as the case may be and not to her daughter as in the present case and hence the granting of maintenance pendente lite to the daughter is not sustainable in law. Taking into consideration of the said argument at the time of admission, Arumugham, J granted interim stay stating ""Interim stay with regard to the order passed by the court below regarding the maintenance amount to be paid for the daughter alone, and notice returnable in two weeks."" The respondent is now represented by her counsel Mr.P.Mani. At the time of hearing, the very same legal contention was raised, stating that under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, interim maintenance cannot be granted to the child of the marriage and the same can be granted for the spouse only. It is also urged by Mr.N. Vanchinathan, learned counsel for the petitioner, that the award of maintenance pendentePandian Alias Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127524/ 1lite to the daughter is contrary to the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and therefore, the order of the subordinate court is vitiated by material irregularities in the exercise of its jurisdiction. He denied the allegation that the petitioner is in affluent circumstances and that in any event, the amount now awarded is on the higher side. In support of his contention, Mr.N. Vanchinathan cited the following decision: Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, Kartachand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain, Mr.P. Mani, learned counsel for the respondent in support of his contention that the court has power to grant interim maintenance not only to the wife but also for the children under Scc.26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and that any interim maintenance to wife alone is meaningless if it does not provide for the maintenance of the children. In support of his contention, he cited Dr. D. Thimmappa v. R. Nagavani, AIR 1976 Kar. 215 Manoj K.R. Jaiswal v. Lila Jaiswal, 1986 (II) DMC 269 Damodharan v. Meera, Smt. Subhasini v. B.R. Umakanth, and Gulab Chand v. Sampati Devi, 6. Before considering the rival submissions of the legal aspect of the matter, it is beneficial to look into the two important provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 with which we arc presently concerned in this lis. Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act reads thus: ""Chapter 19 Section 24 - Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceedings, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceedings, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the court to be reasonable. Chapter 21, Section 26 - Custody of Children. In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree, upon application by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining and such decree were still pending, and the court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made"". 8. Let me deal with the cases cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner and then deal with the cases cited by the learned counsel for the respondent. Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., was rendered by a Division Bench of the said Court. The Division Bench held that in view of the clear provisions of Section 24, there cannot be any dispute that the wife is entitled to pendente lite maintenance when she has no independent income sufficient for her support and also the necessary expenses for the proceedings. In view of the matter, the order for pendente lite maintenance was granted to the defendant No. l was maintained. It is also stated in the judgment that Sect. 24 however docs not authorises grant of pendente lite maintenance to the daughter and inPandian Alias Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127524/ 2terms applies either to the wife or the husband as the case may be. The maintenance of Rs. 10 awarded in favour of the daughter was therefore set aside. 9. Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, was rendered by the Acting Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. The learned Judge held that under Section 24 of the Act, maintenance can be granted during the proceeding in favour of the husband or the wife as the case may be and not in favour of a child born out of the wedlock of the litigating spouses. 10. Kartachand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain, was also render by a learned single Judge of the Bombay High Court (Mehta, J). In this case, the Bombay High Court considered the scope of Sections 24 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The Court held that on a reading of Section 24, it becomes evident that section makes provision for granting maintenance pendente lite to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and that section does not provide granting maintenance for the children, that Section 26 of the said Act provides for interim orders from time to time as also for making provision in the decree with regard to custody, maintenance and education of minor children consistently with their wishes, and that therefore Section 26 empowered the court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provided for maintenance both pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. The High Court held that the lower court in granting separate maintenance to each of the three adult daughters had clearly transgressed beyond the scope of the provision of the sections in exercising its jurisdiction and therefore the order was invalid and contrary to law. 11. In the decisions cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in Assam Chinna Bahu v. Akasam Parhati and Anr., and Puran Chand v. Mst. Kamala Devi, both courts have had no occasion to consider the scope of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. However in the judgment reported in Kartachand Dalliram Jain v. Smt. Taravati Kartarchand Jain, , the learned single Judge considered the scope of Section 26 of the Act, and held that Section 26 of the Act empowers the court to provide for the maintenance of the minor children and it provides for maintenance pendente lite as also after the passing of the decree. Further the said court set aside the grant of maintenance to the three adult daughters on the ground that the Court has awarded the same beyond the scope of the provision of Section 24 and 26 of the Act. 12. Let me now consider the rulings cited by the learned counsel for the respondent in support of his contention in Dr. D. Thimmappa v. R. Nagavani, AIR 1976 Karn. 215, a learned single Judge of the Karnataka High Court (B. Venkataswami, J) held that the Court is entitled to grant maintenance not only for the wife but also for children acting under Section 26 and that when a wife claims maintenance and she has children to support, any interim maintenance to wife alone is meaningless if it does not provide for the maintenance of children also. Assam Chinna Babu v. Akasam Parbati and Anr., was cited before the learned Judge of the Karnataka High Court. The learned Judge distinguishing the Judgment of the Orissa High Court held that the said decision had not examined the scope of Section 26 of the Act on which also reliance had been placed by the respondent before the Karnataka High Court. The apart, the order impugned before the Karnataka High Court was that of a Civil Judge, Mysore who has taken into account the Section 26 of the Act while awarding separate maintenance to the children. Therefore, the learned single Judge held that he decision inPandian Alias Ganesan vs Suganthi on 29 October, 1996 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127524/ 3","['26', '13', '24']"

The appellant in the above appeals, is the petitioner in O.P No.650 of 2007, which was filed under Sec.11 of Hindu Marriage Act 1955 to declare the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent as null and void. She is the respondent in O.P No.163 of 2007 filed under Sec.9 of the Act for restitution of the conjugal rights.V. Prema Kumari vs M. Palani on 19 October, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129106004/ 13. The appellants petition for declaration of the marriage as null and void was dismissed and the respondents petition for restitution of conjugal rights being ordered. These appeals were preferred against the common order. 4. The case of the appellant is as follows: The appellant was born on 19.1.1990 and was residing with her parents at No.11/4, II Street, Kamarajar Nagar, Thiru.Vi.K.Nagar, K.C.Garden, Chennai. 5. The respondent was staying on the first floor of the appellants house from the year 2004 to 2005. Taking advantage of the innocence of the appellant, the respondent by exercising fraud, coercion, undue influence, and mesmerizing through chanted lemons, controlled her mind and kidnapped her on 19.10.2005, from the custody of the parents. The appellant was hardly 15 years of the age at the time of the said unlawful act. She was taken to Thiruvannamalai by the respondent. The parents of the appellant lodged a complaint on 21.10.2005 for the alleged offence of kidnapping. On 22.10.2005, the appellant was rescued at Thiruvannamalai. In Feburary 2006, the respondent alleged that he had married the appellant and sent photographs of the alleged marriage to the neighbours, friends and the appellants parents. The respondent was warned about his illegal acts and a complaint was also given to the police. 6. The respondent filed O.P No.163 of 2007 for restitution of conjugal rights. Since the alleged marriage is a child marriage and against the will of the appellant and also without the consent of the guardian, it is null and void and no such marriage exists in law. However, the appellant was constrained to file a petition under Sec.11 of Hindu Marriages Act to declare the alleged marriage dated 19.10.2005 as null and void. 7. The respondent in his O.P No.163 of 2007 and also in the counter filed in O.P No.650 of 2007 would contend that the appellant was not a minor at the time of the marriage and the marriage was solemnised on 19.10.2005 as per Hindu Rights and Customs and it was a love marriage. He would further allege that they lived together as husband and wife for sometime and the parents of the appellant forcibly took her away from the respondent. Therefore, he has filed an application for restitution of conjugal rights and the petition filed by the appellant under Sec.11 is not maintainable. 8. On the above averments, the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai enquired the applications. The Birth Certificate and the Transfer Certificate of the appellant were perused and it was found that the date of birth of the appellant was 19.1.90 and she had completed only 15 years and nine months at the time of the alleged marriage i.e., on 19.10.2005. However, the learned Judge found that Sec.11 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not applicable as the ground raised in the petiiton will not fall under Sec.11. The learned Judge also considered Secs.12(c) and 13(2)(iv) of Hindu Marriage Act and found that the said provisions were also not applicable and in the result, the learned Judge dismissed the petition filed by the appellant and allowed the petition filed by the respondent. Aggrieved by which, the appellant has preferred both the appeals.V. Prema Kumari vs M. Palani on 19 October, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129106004/ 29. We have carefully heard the contentions put forth on either side and perused the materials available on record. 10. In the course of the arguments, both sides admitted that at the time of the marriage on 19.10.2005 the appellant has only completed 15 years and 9 months. Obviously, it is a child marriage. However, the appellant has filed an application under Sec.11 of the Hind Marriage Act 1955 which reads as follows: 11. Void marriages  Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto (against the other party), be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5 11. Sec.11 deals with void marriages. Under the said section if any marriage solemnised after the commencement of the Act, contravens any one of the conditions specified in the clauses (i),(iv) and (v) of Sec.5 is void and either party can approach the court to delcare the marraige as null and void. 12. Sec.5 of the Act reads as follows: Sec.5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage: A marrriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled namely (i) Neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage (ii) At the time of the marriage, neither party (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of (twenty one years) and the bride, the age of (eighteen years) at the time of the marriage (iv) The parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; 13. To attract Sec.11, there must be a contravention of clauses (i),(iv) and (v) of Sec.5. The mere reading of sub clause (i),(iv) and (v) would show that this provision is not attracted.

Heard the learned counsel for the parties. (2). On a petition filed by the respondent u/S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the District & Sessions Judge, Sri Ganganagar, granted the decree for divorce. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant-non-petitioner, has filed this appeal. (3). According to the averment made in the petition, the marriage between the parties was celebrated on 15.12.1985 according to Hindu rites at Sri Ganganagar. After marriage, the appellant gave birth to a daughter Shobhna who was about 7 years of age on the date of the filing of the petition. The respondent in his petition, prayed for the decree for divorce u/S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of cruelty. It was alleged in the petition that the respondent's mother was the owner of house No. 5A/38 situated at Jawahar Nagar and the appellant asked the respondent's mother to transfer the house to her and threatened that if the house was not transferred to her, a report would be lodged at the Police Station, Sri Ganganagar alleging cruelty and dowry. The house was constructed by the respondent's mother by spending her hard earned money. On 18.7.86, the respondent went to Jaipur in order to obtain training. He returned from Jaipur on 7.1.1987. On his return, he came to know that in his absence the appellant-non-petitioner, with the help of her father Bhoor Singh and some others, forcibly entered into house no. 5A/38 situated at Jawaharnagar in which the respondent's parents were residing and after giving beating to the respondent's parents and terrifying them turned them out of the house and unlawfully occupied the house. This incident occurred some time in January 1987 before the respondent returned from Jaipur. As a consequence of the above incident, the respondent's parents suffered physical and mental pain and they started residing in a quarter constructed in the hospital where respondent's mother was serving. After returning from Jaipur, respondent contacted the appellant-non-petitioner. She made a false statement before him to the effect that his parents had gone away to the quarter situated in hospital campus after giving the beating to her parents. On the same day, the respondent with some well-wishers went to the house of his mother and found that the appellant-non- petitioner's father Bhoor Singh and his helpers were there. They misbehaved with the respondent, assaulted him and turned him out of the house. The appellant-non-petitioner was present at that time but she did not make any protest against the conduct of his father. It was also alleged in the petition filed by the respondent that on G.2.87, the appellant-non-petitioner filed a petition u/S. 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar. That petition was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar by order dated 23.12.89. A revision petition was filed in the court of Additional District Judge N. 2 and the revision petition was dismissed by the Additional District Judge No, 2 by order dated 10.10.91. It was alleged by the respondent that in the application the appellant-non-petitioner, with a view to bring bad name to the appellant and his parents made a false allegation to the effect that theSmt. Pramila Bhatia vs Vijay Kumar Bhatia on 19 May, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1427039/ 1petitioner and his parents used to harass with the object of forcing her to bring money from her parents and it was also false alleged by her that she had brought a sum of Rs. 20, 000/- from her father and that a further sum of Rs. 50, 000/- was demanded from her. These allegations, according to the averments made in the petition filed by the respondent were false. It was also alleged in the petition that the appellant- non-petitioner filed a civil suit no. 77/87 in the court of the Munsif, Sri Ganganagar. The suit was decreed on 6.2.1901 and an appeal was filed in the court of Additional District Judge No. 1, Sri Ganganagar against the decree passed by the Munsif, Sri Ganganagar. In appeal, the Additional District Judge No.1, Sri Ganganagar, set aside the decree passed by the Munsif ant! allowed the appeal by judgment and decree dated 20.5.1994. When the respondent's mother Kamla Devi filed a suit for recovering the possession of the house no. 5A/38 belonging to her, an objection as to the deficiency of the court fee was raised by the appellant-non-petitioner and, therefore, a court fee of Rs. 3945/- was paid. The suit was ultimately decreed on 5.8.93 and an appeal against that decree is pending before the High Court. The case set up by the respondent in his petition u/S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was that the appellant-non-petitioner, is guilty of committing cruelly and that he is entitled to a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty. (4). In reply, it was admitted by the appellant-non-petitioner that her marriage had taken place on 15.12.1985 according to Hindu riles. She denied the allegation that she asked the respondent's mother to transfer the house no. 5A/38 situated in Jawaharnagar to her and gave any threat to her for the purpose of obtaining the house. In her reply, the appellant-non-petitioner alleged that in her marriage, her parents gave dowry beyond their means and that after that she was harassed. With a view to bring money from her parents and when she refused to comply with the demand, she was beaten. It was also alleged that on two occasions, her father give Rs. 10, 000/- on each occasion and these amounts were forcibly taken away by her mother-in-law and further demand of Rs. 50, 000/- was made and when she could not comply with this demand, she was subjected to harassment. In her reply, the appellant-non-petitioner further pleaded that her mother-in-law voluntarily left the house and went to live in the quarter situated in the hospital campus and this was done with a view to make false allegations against her. In short, the allegation of cruelly as alleged in the petition by the respondent was denied. (5). A rejoinder was filed in which all the allegations made by the appellant-non-petitioner were denied by the respondent. (6). The learned District and Sessions Judge framed three issues. The first issue was whether the non-petitioner was guilty of cruelty as alleged in para no. 3 to 10 of the petition and the petitioner was entitled to obtain a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The second issue was regarding the question whether the marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken, if so, to what effect. The third issue was regarding relief. (7). The respondent Vijay Kumar Bhatia (A.W.I) was examined himself and produced her mother Smt. Kamala (A. W.2) in support of the allegations made by him. The appellant-non-petitioner Smt. Pramila (N.A.W.1) examined herself and produced her father Bhoor Singh (N.A.W.2) in support of the case set up by her in the written statement. The certified copies of the statement recorded in earlier proceedings and the certified copies of some other documents were also produced by theSmt.

The learned District and Sessions Judge, after considering the evidence of both the parties, decided issues no. 1 and 2 in favour of the respondent-petitioner and granted decree for divorce u/S. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty. (9). The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the learned District & Sessions Judge has not appreciated the evidence of the parties in the proper perspective and has committed grave error by deciding issues no. 1 and 2 together because they deal with different questions. Regarding the allegation of cruelly made by the respondent in his petition as well as in his statement, the learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the allegations of cruelty are completely false and there is absolutely no ground for grant of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. He has prayed that the appeal be allowed and thej udgment and decree of divorce granted by the District & Sessions Judge be set aside. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the allegations of cruelty, have been proved by oral as well as documentary evidence produced by the respondent-petitioner and the learned District Judge has committed no error in coming to the conclusion that the issues no. 1 and 2 should be decided in favour of the respondent. He has, Therefore, prayed for dismissal of this appeal. (10). The expression 'cruelly' has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act. In Smt. Meera vs. Vijay Shankar Talchidia (1), Hon'ble the Chief Justice observed: ""Cruelty is a ground for divorce u/S. 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Whether particular conduct amounted to cruelty would be determined in each case. It has not been defined in the Act as it was not possible to do so. Sec. 13(1)(ia) has undergone a change by 1976 amendment made by the parliament. ""Before the amendment of 1976, the Act contained a different formulation of cruelty. At that time, the petitioner was required to show that the respondent had treated him or her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the respondent. The change in the formulation of cruelty under the Hindu Marriage Act brings it at par with the Special Marriage Act. It has also simplified it. Cruelly in such cases has to be of the type which should satisfy the conscience of the Court to believe that the relations between the parties had deteriorated to such an extent due to the conduct of one of the spouses that it has become impossible for them to live together without mental agony, torture or distress. Cruelly as a ground of divorce u/S. 13(1) (ia) is a conduct of such type that the petitioner could not reasonably be expected to live with the respondent. Now, the act or omission or conduct which constitutes cruelly need not cause any sort of apprehension in the mind of the petitioner. No rigid meaning can be assigned to cruelty in order to come u/S. 13(1) (ia). What may amount to cruelly in one case may not amount to cruelly in another case. In order to consider whether a particular act complained against amounted to cruelty or not, the Court has to lake into account theSmt.

409,"Delhi High Court Inderjit Kaur vs Rajinder Singh on 16 April, 1980 Equivalent citations: 18 (1980) DLT 197, 1980 RLR 666 Author: T Chawla Bench: T Chawla JUDGMENT T.P.S. Chawla, J. (1) If this case is any indication of the way in which the divorce laws are administered in our courts, there is certainly much cause for dismay. On any view, what happened in this case is very perturbing. (2) In February 1977, the husband instituted a petition, under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for restitution of conjugal rights. He alleged that the wife had 'withdrawn' from his 'society' without 'reasonable excuse', and had not returned despite requests. He also made some complaints about her behavior towards him and his mother. (3) By her answer, the wife alleged, that, soon after the marriage, the husband began making extortionate and unending demands for dowry; and when they were not met she was beaten brutally and ill-treated in many other ways. She said, he had even threatened to kill her and her baby daughter so that he could remarry. Ultimately, she was turned out of the house with her little daughter and not allowed to take anything except the clothes she was wearing. (4) The husband, of course, denied the wife's version, and maintained that she had left without 'any cause or reason'. He reiterated that she had 'misbehaved' with him. and the members of his family, and quoted some further instances. He alleged that. in addition to all her clothes, she had taken away cash, jewellery and other valuables with her. (5) After the pleadings were closed, the evidence of the wife was recorded in October and November 1977. She was examined inchief and cross-examined at considerable length. In answer to a question put at the end of her cross-examination she said : 1 do not want to go to the house of the"" petitioner due to his aforesaid attitude'. She had earlier described in detail the manner in which her husband had treated her. On the next day, the .statement of a witness called by the wife was recorded in part. The case was then adjourned for recording the remaining evidence of the parties on 15th December 1977 and the succeeding' days. (6) On 15th December 1977 the judge has recorded that the parties had 'talked about the (sic) reconciliation' and the wife wanted time 'to reconcile the matter' (by which, I think, he means she wanted time to 'consider' the matter). No evidence was recorded, and the matter was allowed to stand over till the next day. (7) On 16th December 1977 the judge recorded the statements of the parties. They are recorded in Hindi, so I will translate them. The wife said :Inderjit Kaur vs Rajinder Singh on 16 April, 1980 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/478185/ 1'I will go with petitioner (the husband) just now. (She then said) I will go next Friday. The petitioner must provide me with a separate kitchen and must not hit or beat me. My parents will be entitled to come and see me. I will not go to my parents every other day. If the petitioner takes me, I will withdraw my other allegations.' It can easily be seen that the wife was filled with misgivings. She was not willing to go with the husband without some assurances. At first she said she would go with him 'just now', but in the next breath postponed it to the coming Friday. She wanted an assurance that she would get a separate kitchen. But most important of all, she sought an undertaking that she would not be beaten. The fact that she stipulated even for the right to have her parents visit her, shows the sorry pass to which things had come. (8) Then, the husband's statement was recorded. He said : I accept what has been stated by the respondent (the wife). Even earlier her kitchen was separate, and it will remain separate in the future. I never beat her, nor will I do so. If the respondent goes with me, I will withdraw all my allegations, provided she lives with me continuously. the then said) I will make the statement about withdrawing the adlegations when the respondent really wishes to live with me and I am satisfied about that.' So, the husband also had his doubts. The chances of reconciliation were obviously not very bright. (9) After recording the statements, the judge adjourned the case to 23rd December 1977 for further orders. It is not clear, what, if anything, happened during the intervening period. From the subsequent proceedings it can be inferred that nothing happened, and the parties did not come together. (10) On 23rd December 1977, the judge again recorded the statements of the parties. This time the statements were extremely brief. The husband simply said : I am taking the respondent with me today to my house'. The wife said : I am going with the petitioner to his house today'. The judge merely adjourned the matter to 2nd January 1978 for further orders. (11) For some reason, no proceedings took place on 2nd January 1978 and the case was adjourned to 9th January 1978. On this latter date the judge recorded an order which, though replete with typing and other mistakes, succeeds in portraying the situation. Uncorrected, the order reads as follows : 'THOUGH the respondent has been living for the last 18 days since 23-12-1977, but it appears that they are not h""ve been very mooth relations. The respondent alleged that she has been hearten and mal-treated and the petitioner abuses on the every person in the family, and denys maltreatment. Today at least the respondent is not willing to go with the petitioner- I adjourn the case till thursday. In the meanwhile both the parties should think. what have they lost and gain during 16 or 18 days. Case shall come up on 12-1-1978. The respondent presently going today with her mother and father.' It is worth noting that, once again, it is the wife who refuses to go with the husband. Immediately thereafter, probably on the insistence of the wife, the judge recorded a postscript : 'THE respondent also allege that her statement has been recorded by tape record. The petitioner states that no tape record has been used to record her statement.' (12) It was thus patent that theInderjit Kaur vs Rajinder Singh on 16 April, 1980 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/478185/ 2attempt at reconciliation was a fiasco, and, indeed, had given rise to further animosity. In that background, the sage advice of the judge that 'both the parties should think, what they have lost and gain(ed) during 16 or 18 days', though doubtless well-meant, seems mawkish and unrealistic. (13) On 12th January 1978 the wife did not come to court, but only her father did. He told the judge that the wife had not come as her daughter was ill. So the case was adjourned to 19th January 1978. (14) On 19th January 1978, when the case was called, only the parties were present, and not their counsel. Without waiting for counsel to arrive, the judge proceeded to record the statements of the parties. The wife made a most remarkable statement. She said I am willing to live with the petitioner whatever the consequences. Even if he hits or beats me, I will bear it. A decree may be passed against me.' This was a total surrender, wholly out of keeping with the wife's attitude in the past. It ought to have put the judge on his guard. But, unaffected and unconcerned, he went on to record the statement of the husband, who said : I am taking the respondent with me. I will keep her happy in every way.' On this occasion, the husband was not even required to expressly give an undertaking that he would not beat the wife. Forthwith a decree for restitution of conjugal rights was granted to the husband. It was based only on the statements made by the parties on that day, and did not touch the merits. (15) Not surprisingly the 'reconciliation' did not last even for a day. This is revealed from applications subsequently moved by each of the parties. According to the husband, on reaching his house the wife said she had no intention of living with him, and had only come with him from the court so that the decree may be deemed to be satisfied. According to the wife, even on the way to his house from the court, the husband started abusing and chiding her for not conceding him a divorce. At the house she was beaten by the husband's mother and sister and then locked out. Both parties say they lodged reports with the police. I am not concerned with those applications, and, in any case, they produced no tangible result. (16) The wife has now appealed against the decree, and the question is whether it should be allowed to stand. In my opinion the appeal must succeed on three grounds. (17) First, assuming that a decree for restitution of conjugal rights can be made on the basis of a compromise (a question to which I will presently turn), nevertheless, here, the judge should have refused to record the compromise for two reasons : (I) The statement made by the wife was obviously not free and voluntary. No woman in her right senses would, of her own free will, say that her husband may beat her as much as he liked and she would put up with it. The very fact that so startling a statement was being made before him by the wife, should have caused the judge to hesitate and consider whether it was voluntary. More especially, when this wife on previous occasions had complained bitterly about being beaten, and had demanded. assurances in that respect before even contemplating an experimental reconciliation. I am astonished that the judge could bring himself to record, a statement by the wife which, on the face of it, gave license to the husband to commit a crime.

Division, Satara, The learned Civil Judge partly decreed the plaintiffs suit for possession, declaring that she has only 1/4th share in the suit property and that she was entitled to get the same separated on partition. The plaintiff who had claimed the possession of the entire suit property, feeling dissatisfied with the said order, has preferred this Appeal. It may be pointed out that defendant No. 1 has filed a Cross Objection, praying for dismissing the plaintiffs suit and for setting aside the findings recorded by the learned Joint Civil Judge to the effect that she was not the legally wedded wife of the deceased Balwant Shingate. 2. A few relevant facts which would be necessary for deciding this controversy are as under : Deceased Balwant Shingate, who died on 11.8.1978 was the father of the plaintiff. Muktabai was the plaintiffs mother, Balwant was working as a Talathi. He had a brother by name Woman. Balwant and Woman owned some ancestral properties which they got partitioned in the year 1967. The ancestral property included agricultural land and house property. In the said partition the plaintiffs father Balwant was allotted the suit property described in Schedule 'A' & 'B', attached to the plaint. There was also a registered partition deed. 3.

According to the plaintiff, she alone is the legal heir of her father and therefore, she alone is entitled to succeed to his properties. However, the suit properties described in Schedule 'A' & 'B' are in possession of defendant No. 1 - Hirabai, who claims to have married plaintiffs father - Balwant on 11.3.1960. The defendant Nos. 2 to 4 are the daughters of defendant No. 1 from Balwant. It is the plaintiffs case that the marriage of defendant No. 1 - Hirabai with her father Balwant having taken place during the life time of her mother - Muktabai is null and void and therefore, the defendant No. 1 cannot claim to be a legally wedded wife of deceased Balwant. Consequently, the defendant Nos. 2 to 4 are the illegitimate children of defendant No. 1. Therefore, the plaintiff filed the abovementioned suit to recover the suit property, which was in possession of defendant No. 1. The plaintiff has also claimed the amount of gratuity and provident fund which was payable to her deceased father Balwant. 4. Defendant Nos. 1, 3, and 4 resisted the suit under their joint written statement and denied the contentions that the defendant No. 1, was not the legally wedded wife of deceased Balwant. They pointed out that plaintiffs mother Muktabai had contacted breast cancer and that she was incapable of bearing any child. At that time Balwant was a. young man. Therefore, according to the defendants, Muktabai insisted on Balwant's giving her divorce, which was permissible in their caste.Kusum Shivajirao Babar Nee Kumari ... vs Hirabai Balwant Shingate And Ors. on 1 December, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/634608/ 1Defendants further contended that at the insistence of Muktabai, Balwant gave her divorce and married defendant No. 1 - Hirabai in 1960. According to the defendants they along with the plaintiff are the legal heirs of deceased Balwant and as such the plaintiff alone is not entitled to claim the suit property. It is alleged that the plaintiff filed the present suit at the instigation of her uncle - Woman with whom she was residing. 5. Before the Trial Court both the parties laid oral as well as documentary evidence. The learned Judge upon consideration of the evidence on the record came to the conclusion that there was a marriage between deceased Balwant and defendant No. 1 during the life time of Muktabai. He, however, negatived the defendants' plea that Balwant had given divorce to his first wife Muktabai and thereafter, married Hirabai. Consequently, the learned Judge held that the defendant No. 1 not being a legally wedded wife of deceased Balwant, she was not entitled to claim any share in the property. However, she was entitled only to get maintenance out of the suit property. As regards defendant Nos. 2 to 4, the learned Judge relied upon the provisions of Section 16(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and held that even though they are illegitimate children of deceased Balwant, they would be entitled to succeed to the property of their father Balwant. In this view of the matter, the learned Judge concluded the shares of the plaintiff in the suit property as being 1/4th and decreed her claim for partition to that extent. He further declared that defendant No. 1 was entitled to get maintenance at the rate of Rs. 200/- month from the date of the order from the suit property. 6. I have heard Shri A.K. Abhyankar, the learned Advocate for the appellant/plaintiff and Shri M.A. Rane, the learned Advocate for the respondents/defendants. 7. Shri Abhyankar did not seriously dispute before me the fact of marriage between the plaintiffs father - Balwant and defendant No. 1 -Hirabai. He submitted that the defendants failed to prove that deceased Balwant had given divorce to the plaintiffs mother Muktabai. Shri Abhyankar pointed out that there is absolutely no satisfactory evidence to prove the alleged fact of divorce as contended by the defendants and therefore, according to him the finding recorded by the learned Civil Judge in that respect needs no interference. Shri Abhyankar, however, contended that the learned Judge was not right in allowing the plaintiffs claim only to the extent of 1/4th share in the suit property. According to him the plaintiffs claim should have been decreed in toto. Shri Abhyankar argued that the learned Judge erred in giving the benefit of provisions of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act to defendant Nos. 2 to 4. According to him the application of Section 16(3) is restricted to the self acquired property and that the same is not applicable to ancestral property. He, however, submitted that children garbed with legitimacy, cannot succeed to the ancestral property of their parents. In this respect he relied upon the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Shantaram Tukaram Patil and Anr. v. Smt Dagubai Takaram Patil and Ors. . 8. Shri Rane, the learned Advocate for the respondent/defendants, on the other hand pointed out that the deceased Balwant did not have any male issue and therefore, the suit property will have to be treated as his absolute and self acquired property. With the result that defendant Nos. 2 to 4 become entitled to succeed to the same. Shri Rane further submitted that the evidence on the record clearly makes it probable that deceased -Balwant must have given divorce to his first wife - Muktabai.Kusum Shivajirao Babar Nee Kumari ... vs Hirabai Balwant Shingate And Ors. on 1 December, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/634608/ 29. There is ample evidence on the record to show that deceased Balwant had married defendant No. 1 - Hirabai in the year 1960 and that both of them were living together as husband and wife. This position is not seriously disputed before me by Shri Abhyankar. It is also not in dispute that defendant Nos. 2 to 4 are the daughters of defendant No. 1 from deceased Balwant. However, the material question to be considered is with regard to the validity or otherwise of the marriage between deceased Balwant and defendant No. 1 - Hirabai. Admittedly the said marriage had taken place during the life time of the first wife Muktabai. Therefore, in view of the provisions of Section 5(i) read with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the said marriage would be a void marriage. The defendants have, however, come out with a case that deceased Balwant had given a divorce to his first wife Muktabai. It is their case that divorce is permissible in the maratha caste to which the parties belong and that since Muktabai was suffering from breast cancer, she did not have any hope to bear any issue. Therefore, according to them at the instance of Muktabai, deceased Balwant gave her divorce and thereafter, he married to defendant No. 1 - Hirabai. The learned Civil Judge has considered the evidence produced by the defendants in this respect and found that the same is neither cogent nor satisfactory and therefore, declined to accept the plea of divorce as; raised by the defendants. I do not find any fault with the said finding of the learned Civil Judge. It may be pointed out that the evidence regarding the alleged custom is very scanty and vague. No concrete Instance of any divorce having been given in the family at any time before the alleged divorce was shown. Defendant No. 1 stated that there was a registered document regarding divorce. She stated in her cross-examination that after the death of Balwant she got possession of his share. If that was so then there was no difficulty for defendant No. 1 to produce the divorce deed. However, the same was not produced. Under these circumstances, the learned Judge was quite right in not accepting the plea of divorce, raised by the defendants. 10. Since the marriage of defendant No. 1 with deceased Balwant took place during the life time of his first wife Muktabai and since no divorce between Balwant and Muktabai is proved to have taken place, it follows that defendant No. 1 Hirabai cannot be a legally wedded wife of Balwant. Consequently, the defendant Nos. 2 to 4 who are her daughters from Balwant would be the illegitimate children. So far as defendant No. 1 -Hirabai is concerned, there cannot be any dispute of the fact that she would not be entitled to claim any share in the property of deceased - Balwant. The question is, whether the defendant Nos. 2 to 4 who are the illegitimate daughters, can claim any shares in the property of their father deceased Balwant. It may be noted that the children born out of lawful wedlock of their parents are legitimate children and normally they are entitled to inherit the properties of their parents. This was, however, not so under the Hindu law, as it prevailed prior to 1955 with regard to the children who were not born out of lawful wedlock or where the marriage is null and void or declared to be null and void, the children born out of such marriage were treated as illegitimate children. Therefore, under the Hindu law as it existed prior to 1955, they could not claim any share in the properties of their parents. It was really unfortunate that they were not only deprived of their rights to claim a share in the property of their parents but had also to carry a social stigma of being bastards for the whole life. This position was sought to be changed by Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 which reads as under:- Section 16. - Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.-Kusum Shivajirao Babar Nee Kumari ... vs Hirabai Balwant Shingate And Ors. on 1 December, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/634608/ 3","['5', '11', '16']"
411,"Gujarat High Court Gajara Naran Bhura vs Kanbi Kunverbai Parbat on 19 June, 1997 Equivalent citations: AIR 1997 Guj 185 Author: R Balia Bench: R Balia JUDGMENT R. Balia, J. 1. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Appellant in this case is the defendant and husband of respondent. Respondent plaintiff filed a suit for maintenance at the rate of Rs. 100.00 per month and the maintenance charges Rs. 200.00, The suit was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division). Bhuj but in appeal the learned Assistant Judge of Kutch set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and decreed the plaintiffs suit to recover sum of Rs. 100.00/-per month for maintenance from the defendant appellant. Costs of the suit and appeal was also awarded. On being Second Appeal preferred before this Court, the Court while admitting the appeal formulated the following substantial question of law said to be involved for consideration in this case : ""Where the marriage solemnised is in contravention of the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act is void or valid. The suit was filed on 11-11-1974. The plaintiff's case was that her marriage with the defendant look place in the Samyat Year 2025 according to rites and ceremony of Leuva Kanbi caste and she resided with ther husband after marriage. She gave birth to one child whose name is Ramji and who is about one and half years old. The defendant deserted the plaintiff without any reasonable cause by sending her to her parents place and not allowing her to return to her husband's house, though she is ready and willing to reside with her husband. The defendant is not paying maintenance to her. The custody of her child is with the husband. In substance on the ground of husband deserting her without reasonable cause, she claims maintenance with effect from 11-11-1974 while residing separately. The defendant while did not deny the factum of marriage having solemnised but denied the validity of its on the ground that age of wife at the time of marriage was less than 15 years. Plea of divorce was also taken. 2. As noticed above, the suit for maintenance stand decreed by the appellate Court and only question which is required to be considered in this appeal is whether marriage solemnised in violation of Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 is void, which could be ignored for the purpose of creating any obligation for maintenance. It is not in dispute as is found by the courts below that the plaintiff ai the time of her marriage was aged about 10-12 years as per her own admission. It is also not in dispute that husband at the time of marriage was of the marriageable age. That marriage was duly consummated and the relationship of husband and wife subsisted even after attaining the eligible age by the wife which resulted in birth of child as well. 3. If one looks at the provisions of Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, the scheme of the Act envisages that it does not deal with the legality or validity of the marriage at all. It defines what is meant by child. It also defines child marriage to mean a marriage to which either of the parties in contract is a child. Section 3 makes a male above 18 years but below 18 years contracting childGajara Naran Bhura vs Kanbi Kunverbai Parbat on 19 June, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/928849/ 1marriage punishable with imprisonment which may extend to 15 days or fine and Section 4 makes the contracting of child marriage by a male above 21 years punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and fine. Section 5 subjects any person performing, contracting or directing child marriage punishable with simple imprisonment. Section 6 makes a person who is guardian of a minor contracting child marriage liable to punishment with simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and fine. Sections 7 to 10 deal with procedural part of taking congnizance of offences and jurisdiction, of the court and preliminary enquiries. Section 12 which is of signifance for the present purposes empowers the court if it is satisfied on information led before it through a complaint or otherwise that a child marriage in contravention of the Act has been arranged or is about to be solemnised to issue an injunction against any of the persons mentioned in Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Act prohibiting such marriage. Reading of Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 leaves no room of doubt that a person contracting a child marriage has been used with reference to marriage with a girl below the prescribed age only. A girl of eligible age marrying a male child is not punishable under Sections 3, and 4, as these provisions apply only to a male marrhing a child. Even under Section 6, the words used are where a minor contracts a child marriage. In the context of Sections 3 and 4. the phrase can reasonably lead to only one inference that here minor is referable to a male below 18 years of age contracting a child marriage, obviously, wilh a girl who look is a child, then the person having in charge of minor male has been held liable to punishment. Thus, firstly, it is to be seen that Child Marriage Restraint Act does not make a wife falling in the definition of child liable to contravention of the provisions of the Act. 4. Secondly, Section 12 which envisages on satisfaction by the Court to issue an injunction against arranging or solemnising a marriage in contravention of the Act clearly goes to show that there is no statutory declaration of affecting marriage against the marriages solemnised between the persons defined as child under the Act by itself to proscribe such a child marriage to be solemnised and injunction of the Court is envisaged rather than statutory prohibition under the Act itself. Had the effect of the Child Marriage Act was to render marriage solemnised between parties who are child was to render void ab initio, the provisions like Section 12 requiring an injunction issued in that regard would not have been there. 5. It is also to be kept in view that marriage in question has been solemnised in Samyat Year 2025. somewhere in 1967 when Hindu Marriage Act has come in force. Parties to the marriage are admittedly Hindus and are governed by Hindu Marriage Act. The legislative field prescribing requisites of a valid marriage, eligible criteria for persons who can contract marriage and effect of any breach of any of the conditions prescribed for a valid marriage has been occupied by Hindu Marriage Act, 1956 and the validity or otherwise of a marriage of Hindu which has been performed by customary rites has to be determined in accordance with the said Act. The provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act puts it beyond the pail of doubt that a marriage solemnised between persons who are not of eligible age and are not in accordance with the provisions of Child Marriage Restraint Act is not void ab inilio but can only be avoided in certain circumstances. Section 5 lays down the conditions for a Hindu Marriage. Sub Clause (iii) of Section 5 provides that one of the conditions for solemnising marriage between two Hindus is that the bridegroom hasGajara Naran Bhura vs Kanbi Kunverbai Parbat on 19 June, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/928849/ 2completed the age of 21 years and the bride the age of 18 years at the time of marriage. The respective age for bridegroom and bride prior to its amendment by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 was 18 years and 15 years. This provisions clearly envisaged at the relevant time, for the present purposes, 1969. that a girl who was minor but above fifteen years of age was eligible for solemnisation of a valid marriage according to the Act. Section 11 provides about the absence of conditions which makes the marriage void ab initio and nullity. According to that provision the only conditions in which a marriage solemnised between 2 Hindus is to be treated null and void and a decree to that effect can be made are that (i) other party must not have a spouse living al the time of marriage, (ii) the parties must not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the customary usage governing each of the parties permit marriage between such decrees, (iii) and that parties must not be sapindas of each other which condition is also subject to custom to the contrary. Section 12 deals with voidable marriages inter alia provides that where the consent of the petitioner or where the consent of guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required as it stood immediately before the commencement of Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978. The consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of me ceremony or to any material fact on circumstances concerning the respondent is voidable which is further inhibited by the condition that no petition annulling a marriage on the said ground shall be entertained if the petition is presented more than one year after the force has ceased to operate or as the case may be, after discovery of fraud on the petitioner has with his on her full consent lived with other party as husband or wife as the case may be. 6. Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act is a complete answer to the contention of the appellant that a marriage Contracted in contravention of the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act is void and cannot be considered us valid on any ground. Firstly, it is to be noticed that mere breach of condition (iii) about the age for solemnisation of marriage between two Hindu by itself does not affect the validity of the marriage and no consequence thereto has been provided either under Section 11 or Section 12 of Hindu Marriage Act. The limited ground for avoiding such marriage by seeking declaration of its nullity and decree of annulment by treating, it to be voidable is that petitioner's consent or if marriage has been solemnised prior to 1978 and the consent on behalf of minor party of the marriage from his guardian was obtained either by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or to any material fact or circumstances concerning the respondent. It is not the appellant's ease that his consent for marriage was obtained by force. or, by practicing fraud. He was admittedly adult at the time, of marriage and does not have an option to get the marriage to be annulled by a decree of nullity because his consent as a party to marriage as an adult contracting party was neither obtained by fraud nor by force. Nor his consent was obtained by keeping back from him any information about the age of wife. As a matter of fact Sub-clause (c) of Section 12(1) only gives an option to the minor contracting party to avoid a marriage by a decree of nullity. Section 12 does not declare the marriage to be void. It only gives an opinion to concerned party to gel a decree for annulment of such marriage by exercise of option to avoid the marriage on condition aforesaid. Without obtaining a decree of nullity, plea of nullity of marriage could, not be taken by the concerned party in defence to a claim for maintenance.Gajara Naran Bhura vs Kanbi Kunverbai Parbat on 19 June, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/928849/ 3","['6', '4', '3', '12', '5', '11']"
412,"Delhi High Court Ms. Suresh Khullar vs Mr. Vijay Khullar on 22 April, 2002 Equivalent citations: AIR 2002 Delhi 373, 98 (2002) DLT 41, II (2002) DMC 131, 2002 (62) DRJ 758 Author: M A Khan Bench: M A Khan JUDGMENT Mahmood Ali Khan, J. 1. This civil revision petition is filed under Section 115 of the CPC assailing the order of an Additional District Judge dated 24.2.1997 whereby he has dismissed an application of the petitioner filed for grant of interim maintenance to her during the pendency of proceeding instituted under Sections 18, 20 and 23 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (hereinafter the Act) against the respondent. 2. The short question that arises for adjudication in this revision petition is whether the petitioner, the second wife of the respondent, may be allowed the interim maintenance under Section 18 of the Act. The facts are short and simple. The respondent was married to one Ms. Manju Khullar in 1980. He filed a divorce petition in the court of the District Judge, Himachal Pradesh and his marriage with Ms. Manju Khullar was dissolved by an ex parte decree of divorce dated 29.10.1984. Thereafter he contracted second marriage with the petitioner on 14.10.1988. Ms. Manju Khullar filed application for setting aside the ex parte divorce decree which was allowed by the District Judge, Himachal Pradesh by order dated 4.11.1989. The petitioner filed a petition against the respondent under Sections 18 and 20 of the Act for grant of maintenance to her. She also filed an application for grant of interim maintenance during the pendency of the proceeding. The allegation of the petitioner was that the respondent had married her by representing to her that he was a divorcee and he had obtained valid divorce from his first wife Ms. Manju Khullar. Later on the petitioner came to know that the respondent had played a fraud upon her. She alleged that after the marriage she was treated with mental and physical cruelty by the respondent and he other members of his family. He filed a petition for divorce against her. During its pendency he moved an application for amendment of the petition stating the divorce decree obtained by him against his wife Ms. Manju Khullar had been set aside and, therefore, the marriage between him and Ms. Manju Khullar shall be deemed to be subsisting at the time of his marriage with the petitioner. He, therefore, claimed a decree of nullity of the marriage. He was a businessman and his income was in four figures. He also had a diploma in Industrial Marketing Management and was a well-to-do man with business interest and properties including commercial office in Lajpat Nagar. She prayed for granting interim maintenance to her. The application is opposed by the respondent. 3. The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the application mainly on the ground that the petitioner being the second wife of the respondent, marriage having been solemnised during the subsistence of the first marriage, was not entitled to be granted maintenance under the Act. He relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bakulabai etc. v. Gangaram 1998 RLR (SC) 171. He also dismissed the main petition.Ms. Suresh Khullar vs Mr. Vijay Khullar on 22 April, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1410260/ 14. The petitioner has not disputed that her marriage with the respondent shall be deemed to have been solemnised during the subsistence of the respondent's marriage Ms. Manju Khullar. The parties are Hindu and are governed by the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act. The provisions of the Act were also applicable on them. Clause (i) of Section 5 of Hindu Marriage Act lays down, for a lawful marriage, the necessary conditions are that neither party should have spouse living at the time of the marriage. The marriage on contravention of this condition was, therefore, null and void. Such a marriage could be declared null and void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. No doubt when the petitioner was married to the respondent on 14.10.1988 the marriage of the respondent with his first wife Ms. Manju Khullar had been dissolved by an ex parte divorce decree by the District Judge, Una in Himachal Pradesh. But the ex parte decree was set aside by the court in 1989. The respondent also withdrew his own the divorce petition. As a consequence of the setting aside of ex parte decree of divorce by the court, the marriage between the respondent and his first wife Ms. Manju Khullar shall be deemed to be subsisting in law on 14.10.1988 when the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnised. If it is so, there is no escape from holding that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent became null and void and conferred no right on the parties. In other words, the petitioner lost the status of a wife who can claim maintenance either under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act or under the provisions of the Act. 5. The petition is filed by the petitioner for maintenance under Section 18, 20 and 23 of the Act. Section 20 deals with legal obligation of a Hindu to provide maintenance to his legitimate or illegitimate children and old parents. Section 23, on the other hand, indicates the guidelines to the court while fixing the quantum of maintenance. Section 18, however, being relevant for deciding the question involved is reproduced below:- ""18. Maintenance of wife.- (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. (2) A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband without for feiting her claim to maintenance.- (a) if he is guilty of desertion, that is to say, of abandoning her without reasonable cause and without her consent or against her wish, or of willfully neglecting her; (b) if he has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with her husband. (c) if he is suffering from a virulent from of leprosy; (d) if he has any other wife living;Ms. Suresh Khullar vs Mr. Vijay Khullar on 22 April, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1410260/ 2(e) if he keeps a concubine in the same house in which his wife is living or habitually resides with a concubine elsewhere; (f) if he has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion; (g) if there is any other cause justifying her living separately. 6. The word ""a Hindu wife"" used in this Section are significant. Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act will be applicable to a person who is a Hindu. The word 'Hindu' has been given a wider meaning and includes within its ambit every person, who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion. Sub-section (3) of Section 2 expands the meaning of the word 'Hindu' further and states that this words included a person who though not a Hindu by religion was nevertheless a person to whom this Act applied by virtue of the provisions of Section 2. The expression 'a Hindu wife', as such connotes that a wife, who is Hindu, as defined by Section 2 of the Act in its widest sense, has a right to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime by dint of Section 18. A Hindu wife whose marriage was solemnised with a Hindu male before the commencement of the Act, who had one or more spouses living, shall also be entitled to be maintained by her husband. Before the enactment of Hindu Marriage Act in 1955 a Hindu male, in law, could have married more than one wife. The embargo on his performing marriage with another woman during the lifetime of his first spouse was put by Hindu Marriage Act It is clear from Section 18 that a non-Hindu wife of a Hindu husband had no right to claim maintenance from her husband under the provisions of this Act. Similarly a wife who ceases to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion is also not entitled to claim maintenance under the Act as per Section 24. 7. The word 'wife' has not been defined under the Act. It has also not been defined by the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act. However, how a marriage could be solemnised between two Hindus legally is codified in Section 7. Conditions essential for a valid marriage are embodied in Section 5 of Hindu Marriage Act. The first condition is that neither party should have a spouse living at the time of the marriage. The expression 'spouse living' used in this Section is to be understood as the existence of a legally wedded spouse, husband or wife. The word 'wife' is used in some of the enactments regulating the matrimony in a narrow meaning i.e., the marriage which is performed/contracted as per procedure prescribed by law. Some other enactments use it in a wider meaning. For instance, Hindu Marriage Act used this word in its restricted sense i.e. a woman whose marriage is performed/solemnised with a Hindu male in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Section 7 of the Act and is not void as declared by Section 5. On the other hand Section 125 of the Civil Procedure Code which empowers a Magistrate to grant maintenance, inter alia, to a wife, states that the word ""wife"" will include a woman whose marriage has been dissolved by divorce and has not remarried. The petitioner has claimed maintenance under the provisions of the Act, which though not defined the word 'wife', but have used it in the same meaning which have been given to this word under Hindu Marriage Act since the right to maintenance arises out of the status of a wife. The expression 'a Hidnu wife', therefore, has to be given its ordinary meaning. A Hindu woman whose marriage is solemnized with a Hindu husband in accordance wit the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act and is not void or dissolved by a decree of divorce is, as such, a Hindu wife within the meaning of Section 18 of the Act.Ms. Suresh Khullar vs Mr. Vijay Khullar on 22 April, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1410260/ 3","[ '20', '23', '18', '24', '12','5','2', '11', '7']"

DHARMADHIKARI, J. DATED : JANUARY 21, 2009. ORAL JUDGEMENT. 1. The husband has filed these two Second Appeals challenging the judgment dated 19.11.1993 delivered in Regular Civil Appeal Nos.14 and 15 of 1991 by the Additional District Judge, Bhandara. By this common judgment, the Additional District Judge has allowed the appeal filed by the respondent - wife before it and dismissed the appeal filed by the husband in the matter. 2. The court of 2nd Jt. Civil Judge, Senior Division, Bhandara was approached in Hindu Marriage Petition No. 2/1984 by respondent wife under section 23 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 claiming judicial separation, under section 37, claiming permanent alimony and maintenance. She also moved application under section 38 and claimed custody of her son. The appellant - husband who was respondent in that matter pointed out that vide Exh.61 the marriage between the parties was dissolved as per the customs prevalent in Kunbi community and hence there was no marriage subsisting. The Trial Court framed various issues and found that the respondent WifeAnandrao vs Madhuri Posing Herself To Be on 21 January, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/726164/ 2could not establish that divorcee deed dated 18.10.1992 was obtained from her by exercising fraud or coercion. It also found that the respondent husband was not entitled to dissolve the marriage by mutual consent in customary way and the marriage was still subsisting and therefore, decree for judicial separation could not be granted. The wife as also husband filed appeals and the Appellate Court then allowed the appeal by wife and granted her decree of judicial separation and dismissed the appeal of husband and held that the marriage between the parties was still subsisting. The husband then filed these two appeals against the said common judgment and on 17.03.1994 the appeals have been admitted by mentioning ground nos. 4 and 5 as substantial questions of law involved in the matter. During arguments the learned counsel for husband also urged that ground no.10 and 11 need to be considered in second appeal. The arguments advanced were as per those questions and hence the said questions are reproduced below for ready reference. ""(4). Whether it is open to the parties whose marriage is solemnized under the Special Marriage Act by mutual consent to dissolve their marriage as per their custom ? (5). Whether a marriage between Hindus can be legally dissolved as per the customs which are saved by the Hindu Marriage Act even though the marriage is solemnized under the Special Marriage Act ? (10).Whether it is within the jurisdiction of a Court acting as a First Appellate Court to travel beyond the pleadings of the petition and grant the relief of judicial separation on a ground not raised and pleaded by the petitioner ? (11) Whether the Lower Appellate Court was justified in granting a decree for judicial separation on a ground on which the petition judicial separation was not presented to the Court and to which the appellant had no opportunity to meet and defend ?"" 3. Advocate Shri Bhutada for appellant / husband has contended that the courts below have erred in not noticing that the Special Marriage Act did not repeal the custom of divorce prevailing amongst Kunbi community. He points out that on facts there is no dispute about existence of such custom and the Courts below have found that the custom is not available as the marriage is solemnized under Special Marriage Act. This approach is erroneous and contrary to the provisions of Special Marriage Act. It is further argued that as both the parties to the marriage are Hindu, Hindu Marriage Act is applicable and hence because of provisions of Section 4 read with 29[2], the custom of divorce prevalent in Kunbi community is protected. Therefore, the customary divorce obtained vide Exh.71 is legal and valid. He further states that Special Marriage Act also does not militates of such application of Hindu Marriage Act and hence the question needs to be answered infavour of the appellant husband. In relation to additional questions sought to be urged, the learned counsel contends that the grounds for judicial separation not raised before the Trial Court have been looked into by theAnandrao vs Madhuri Posing Herself To Be on 21 January, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/726164/ 3",['4']

Since both the above two revisions have been filed against the common order dated 3-7-2010 passed by the 9th Additional Sessions Judge (FTC), Raipur in Sessions Trial No.68/2010, for quashing of the charges framed against the applicants under Sections 304B & 498A of the IPC, they are being disposed of by this common order. 2. As per case of the prosecution, Smt. Kiran Mishra (since deceased) - wife of Rakesh Gautam i.e. applicant No.1 in Criminal Revision No.408/2010, was married to Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 in accordance with her custom. Gouna ceremony was performed in the year 2002. Applicant Rakesh Gautam and other applicants i.e. relatives of Rakesh Gautam - husband of Kiran Gautam, committed torture & cruelty upon Kiran Gautam in connection with demand of dowry and finallyRakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109204247/ 1Kiran Gautam died on 31-12-2008 in her matrimonial house in abnormal circumstances. Report was lodged, matter was investigated and finally, charge sheet has been filed against the applicants. After hearing the parties, the trial Court has framed charge under Sections 304B & 498A of the IPC against all the applicants i.e. husband of the deceased and relatives of husband of the deceased. 3. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused both the criminal revisions, copy of charge sheet and reply filed on behalf of the State/non-applicant. 4. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that as per case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam (since deceased) was married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 and she committed suicide or she died in abnormal circumstances on 31- 12-2008 after more than seven years of her marriage and, therefore, the trial Court was not competent to frame charge under Section 304B of the IPC. Penal provisions are required to be applied strictly and the Court was under obligation to frame charge in accordance with the provisions of Section 304B of the IPC. In order to frame charge under Section 304B of the IPC, the prosecution is required to show prima facie material that there was valid marriage, the bride died in abnormal circumstances as a result of suicide or bodily injury or burns within seven years of her marriage and she has been subjected to cruelty or torture in connection with demand of dowry soon before her death. In the present case, as per case of the prosecution, Kiran Gautam died in abnormal circumstances after more than seven years of her marriage. 5. Learned counsel for the applicants placed reliance in the matter of Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P., Hyderabad v. Tota Basava Punnaiah and others1 in which the High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held that Section 304B of the IPC is a special provision which is inserted by the amendment in 1986 to deal with dowry deaths. It applies where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, if the other conditions i.e. demand of dowry soon before her death and death within seven years of her marriage, are satisfied. Learned counsel further placed reliance in the matter of Baljeet Singh and another v. State of Haryana2 in which the Supreme Court has held that the prosecution is required to establish that the bride died within seven years of her marriage. Learned counsel also placed reliance in the matter of Chhagan v. State of Madhya Pradesh3 in which the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that in case of death of wife after more than seven years of her marriage, no presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short `the Act') would be available. Learned counsel relied upon the matter of Satyabhan Patel v. State of M.P.4 in which the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has held that for the purpose of presumption under Section 113A of the Act, the date of marriage is the material date and not date of Gouna ceremony. 6. On the other hand, learned State counsel opposes both the revisions and submits that definitely, the prosecution is required to collect sufficient material to show that the bride died within seven years of her marriage in abnormal circumstances and to satisfy the other ingredients of the offence of dowry death. Learned State counsel further submits that the word `marriage' should not be construed in technical or limited sense, `marriage' is the sacred union, legally permissible, of two healthy bodies of opposite sexes. In the present case, parties are Hindus and for completion of marriage or solemnization of marriage, parties are required to observe the custom prevailing in theirRakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109204247/ 2caste or society. Learned State counsel also submits that Gouna ceremony is a part of marriage and marriage only completes after Gouna ceremony and prior to Gouna ceremony there was no occasion of meeting of bride with bridegroom and, therefore, the crucial date for reckoning seven years of marriage in case of social group in which Gouna ceremony is prevalent, is the date of Gouna and not the date of technical marriage. 7. As per the material collected on behalf of the prosecution, available in the charge sheet, bride Kiran Gautam was married to applicant Rakesh Gautam in the year 2000 and her Gouna ceremony was performed in the year 2002. If Gouna ceremony is considered as completion of marriage, charge framed by the trial Court is sustainable under the law and if Gouna ceremony is not considered as essential part of marriage, presumption under Section 113A of the Act would not be available and charge framed against the applicants under Section 304B of the IPC would not be sustainable under the law. 8. Both the parties are Hindus, governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides conditions for solemnization of marriage between Hindus which reads as follows: - ""5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage.-A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:- (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity; (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage; (iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;""Rakesh Gautam vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 10 March, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109204247/ 3","['11', '5', '30']"

P Upasani Bench: T C Das, M D Upasani JUDGMENT Dr. Pratibha Upasani, J. 1. The story revealed in these legal proceedings is the story of a husband, wife and the ""other woman"" in the husband's life, as usual. The unusual angle of this usual story is the legal angle which gives food for thought as to what status this ""other woman"" exactly has in a monogamous society, if it turns out that the ""other woman"" also is a legally wedded wife, and has the same status? What then happens to the other wife? What if relationship goes soar with both the wives at one time or the other, the couple is divorced and reunited, and the second wife is now isolated and asks for maintenance? All this material is quite spicy and hot enough to churn out a Hindi Masala Movie, displaying sentiments like love, lust, selfishness, materialism and urge for survival. But, Reeta Bharat Arora, Indu Bharat Arora and Bharat Yasodanandan Arora are not the imaginary characters playing roles on the screen in the reel life. They are the real persons, in flesh and blood, being singed by harsh circumstances. The wives are the puppets in the hands of destiny. And why blame only destiny? Their husband Bharat also has been selfish all throughout, and has spoiled the lives of these two women; and hold your breath, the Law has added to the woes of the wives. But first, the few admitted facts : 2. On or about 26th January, 1981, Bharat Arora married one Indu Kapoor at Delhi. Indu and her parents were hailing from Indore. Bharat and Indu resided together and cohabited as husband and wife at Bombay. On or about 17th August, 1981, Indu left for Indore. On 25th February, 1982, a son namely. Sunny was born to Indu from the said wedlock. Unfortunately, disputes had already started between Bharat and Indu. Earlier also she had left for her parents' place, but there was some sort of compromise between husband and wife. Thereafter, when she went to Indore in the year 1981, prior to Sunny's birth in 1982, she did not come back. Bharat then filed M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984 in the Bombay City Civil Court for divorce on the ground of cruelly and desertion. In the said Petition, Bharat had made several allegations against Indu and had even expressed doubt about paternity of the son. Indu was contesting this matrimonial petition, refuting the allegations, and written statement also was filed by her. Hearing of the matter was adjourned from time to time. During all these years, by and large, Indu used to reside with her parents at Indore. During the pendency of the above referred Petition, sometime in the year 1988. Bharat developed illicit relationship with one Reeta Dhawan nee Reeta Sunil Grover. Incidently, Reeta's divorce proceedings with her husband Sunil Grover also were pending in the City Civil Court till November, 1987 and decree of divorce was granted by City Civil Court in Sunil Grover's favour, dissolving his marriage with Reeta, only on 30th November, 1987. On 28th May, 1989, a daughter by name Shikha was born to Reeta from the illicit relationship with Bharat. The relationship continued, though Reeta very much knew that Bharat was a married person, and his marriage with Indu was subsisting. The stalemate in respect of marriage of Bharat with Indu continued. But on 12th September, 1989, City Civil Court Judge (Ms. R. S. Dalvi) passed ex parte decree of divorce in M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984, after recording evidence of Bharat, in brief, when the matter was in fact appearing on the Board under the caption of ""FramingSmt. Reeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/617601/ 1of Issues"". Neither Indu, nor her Advocate was present at the hearing of this Petition on 12th September, 1989. No issues were framed, nor was any finding given in respect of the alleged matrimonial offence of desertion and cruelty, but the Judge recorded undertaking of the Petitioner Bharat to the effect that ""the Petitioner shall not remarry for a period of thirty days from the date of the said decree"". Thus, the undertaking was restricted to a period of only thirty days. On 5th November, 1989, Bharat got married with Reeta in accordance with Hindu Vedic Rites. On 5lh November, 1989, declaration that Reeta and Bharat were married was made. The said marriage was thereafter registered on 5th February, 1990. Indu Arora, allegedly, came to know of the ex parte decree passed against her, dissolving her marriage with Bharat on 9th November, 1989. By that time. Family Courts were constituted in Bombay in October, 1989. Indu Arora therefore took out Miscellaneous Application No. 2 of 1990 for setting aside the ex parte decree, in the Family Court, accompanied by application for condonation of delay. On 15th December, 1989, Indu also filed First Appeal No. 336 of 1990 in the High Court of Bombay, challenging the ex parte decree passed against her by City Civil Court Judge, dissolving her marriage with Bharat. In Family Court, in reply to the Application made by Indu Arora, for setting aside the ex parte decree. Bharat did not mention that he had remarried. On 7th August. 1991, Family Court Judge (Mr. S. D. Pandit) passed order in Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 2 of 1990, setting aside the ex parte decree. The said order of the Family Court was challenged by Bharat Arora in the High Court by filing Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991. In the meantime, there was reconciliation between Bharat and Indu. In fact, on 2nd June, 1992, Bharat and Indu applied for withdrawal of the proceedings in the Family Court. On 3rd June, 1992. Reeta filed Civil Application No. 2846 of 1992 in Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 filed by Bharat in High Court for being impleaded as a party-respondent. Recta also filed M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 in the Family Court at Bandra for a declaration that her marriage with Bharat was legally valid and subsisting. She also moved Interim Application No. 441 of 1992 and the Family Court passed order, restraining Bharat from throwing Reeta out of the flat at Grand Paradi Apartments, August Kranti Marg, Bombay, where Reeta was staying along with her daughter Shikha. Reeta also got injunction order by way of ad interim relief restraining Bharat from disposing of the said flat in Grand Paradi Apartments, so also restraining Bharat from entering her bedroom. Reeta also moved various applications for interim reliefs in the Family Court, on which, orders came to be passed against Bharat and Bharat challenged all those orders in the High Court by filing various Writ Petitions, including Writ Petition No. 2889 of 1993. In Writ Petition No. 2889 of 1993, Bharat had challenged the interlocutory order passed by Family Court granting maintenance of Rs. 4,000/- per month to Reeta and Rs. 1,500/- per month to daughter Shikha. In addition, the Family Court also ordered Bharat to deposit Rs. 5,000/- towards maintenance of Reeta. Indu also filed M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 in the Family Court at Bandra, inter alia, praying for a declaration that Bharat and Reeta's marriage was not valid. On 22nd September, 1993, Bharat had made application in High Court to withdraw the Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991. Mr. V. P. Tipnis. J. however, declined to pass order permitting Bharat to withdraw the said Petition, observing that complex questions of facts and law were involved in the said Petition, and therefore, it was to be decided on merits only. On 29th April, 1993, Family Court again passed order being interlocutory order directing Bharat to pay Rs. 5,500/- per month to Reeta and Shikha as maintenance. This order, when challenged by Bharat, in the High Court, was upheld, and in fact, undertaking was filed by Bharat in the High Court for payment of maintenance to Reeta and daughter Shikha.Smt. Reeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/617601/ 2Thus, there is no dispute between the parties with respect to the dates, the chronology of events, and the pending litigation between them. 3. This Court (Mr. D. R. Dhanuka, J.) by its common Judgment and Order dated 1st March, 1994 disposed of First Appeal No. 336 of 1990 which was filed by Indu, so also. Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 and Writ Petition No. 2289 of 1993 filed by Bharat. The matter was argued at length by the respective Advocates, and this Court, by giving exhaustive reasons, allowed the First Appeal filed by Indu, and the ex parte decree dated 12th September, 1989 was set aside and M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984 filed by Bharat was dismissed as withdrawn. Objection of Reeta for permitting Bharat to withdraw the said M. J. Petition, was rejected. Both the Writ Petitions filed by Bharat came to be dismissed by this Court by its common Judgment and Order dated 1st March, 1994, and direction was given to the Family Court to dispose of the pending Petitions filed by Reeta as well as Indu being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 filed by Reeta and M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 filed by Indu, as expeditiously as possible. While disposing of these Writ Petitions and First Appeal by common Judgment and Order, this Court made certain observations with respect to the conduct of Reeta. The learned Judge observed that the conduct of Reeta in having illicit relationship with a married person like Bharat since the year 1988, was blame-worthy. Reeta also felt aggrieved because the learned Judge confirmed the interlocutory order of the Family Court, and was not happy with the quantum of maintenance. She was also unhappy because the learned Judge allowed Bharat to withdraw his M. J. Petition being M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984, and the order of allowing the First Appeal filed by Indu and setting aside ex parte decree dated 12th September, 1989 passed by the Judge of the City Civil Court, dissolving the marriage between Bharat and Indu. Being aggrieved, Reeta has filed Letters Patent Appeal No. 86 of 1994 (in Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991), so also. Letters Patent Appeal No. 87 of 1994 (in First Appeal No. 336 of 1990). Reeta also has filed Family Court Appeal No. 3 of 2001, since the Family Court did not pass any order on arrears of maintenance payable to her and daughter Shikha, while disposing of finally heard M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992. Reeta was also aggrieved, as the Family Court did not express its opinion on validity of marriage of Indu with Bharat. Another ground for filing the Family Court Appeal No, 3 of 2001 by Reeta was that the Family Court Judge did not grant her prayer with respect to security deposit for future maintenance to be paid by Bharat to her. It has to be stated here that as per the directions given by Mr. D. R. Dhanuka, J. while disposing of First Appeal No. 336 of 1990. Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 and Writ Petition No. 2289 of 1993, the Family Court Judge recorded the evidence of parties and disposed of both the M. J. Petitions being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 filed by Reeta and M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 filed by Indu by his common Judgment dated 31st December, 1999. By giving exhaustive reasoning, the Principal Judge of the Family Court at Bandra dismissed Indu's M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992, and allowed Reeta's M. J. Petition being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992. The learned Judge gave a declaration that Reeta's marriage with Bharat was valid. Bharat was restrained by an order of injunction from ousting Reeta from her matrimonial home i.e. 91-A. 9th floor, Grand Paradi Apartments, August Kranti Marg, Bombay-36.Smt.

The two points which arise for consideration in this appeal are -(1) whether the quantum of the permanent alimony awarded by the lower Court to the appellant is inadequate; and (2) whether the lower Court has erred in refusing to direct the respondent to return the property claimed by the appellant. 2. The facts necessary for the disposal of this appeal, briefly stated, are as under; 3. Appellant and respondent were respectively the husband and the wife. Appellant filed a petition, M.C.No.81/1981. In the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore (lower Court') praying for a decree against the respondent for divorce; for permanent alimony and for the return of her articles described in the schedule to the petition. By then, the husband had filed a petition, M.C.No.59/1981, in the lower Court praying for a decree of divorce against the wife. The lower Court, by its common Judgment dated 3-12-1982, allowed M.C.No.81/1981 filed by the wife granting her a decree of divorce and monthly alimony of Rs. 200A However, her prayer for direction to the husband to return her articles was rejected. The lower Court also rejected the petition, M.C.No.59/1981, filed by her husband. Not being satisfied with the quantum of alimony and the refusal to direct the return of her articles, the wife has filed this appeal against the decree in M.C.No.81/1981. 3A. We have heard Sri S.G. Sundaraswamy, learned Advocate for the appellant. Respondent though served in the appeal, was neither present at the hearing nor was he represented. 4. It will have to be seen, in the first instance, as to whether the quantum of alimony awarded by the lower Court is inadequate, as contended for. Sri Sundaraswamy, learned Advocate for the appellant, sought to support his contention by placing reliance on the decision in GENGLER v. GENGLER, 1976(2) All E.R. @ 81. According to him, the lower Courts' approach in deciding the quantum of alimony in the present case, should not have been different from the one pointed out in Gengler's case (supra) thus: ""Now the approach in divorce proceedings is that which was at last approved in Watchtel v. Watchtel (1973) 1 All ER 829, [(1973) Fam 72] by the Court of Appeal, namely that one starts with the wife having one-third of the joint incomes less her own earnings. I need not go into the old cases of Ward v. Ward [(1947) 2 All ER 713, (1948) p.62] and Jones v. Jones [(1929) All ER Rep. 424]. Social conditions and the financial and other status of wives and women have greatly changed since those days. This Court has already said, and I repeat, that there is no reason, in my opinion, why the justices should not start with the one-third approach, Counsel for the husband realistically agrees that the joint income is the husband's gross income and the wife's net income. That is the correct approach. One takes the gross income, that is his income before tax, because the maintenance orderGowri vs Satish on 3 August, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/614268/ 1is deducted from his wage or salary before tax is calculated, and the wife's net income because that is all she receives to live on after tax is deducted from her wage or salary. Allowable deductions from a husband's gross earnings are the statutory insurance contributions and travelling expenses to work."" Though we gave our anxious consideration to the said contention of Sri S.G. Sundaraswamy, we have found it difficult to accede to the same because of the express provisions in Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 ('the Act'), laying down the approach required to be adopted by Courts in determining the quantum of maintenance under the Act. In other words, when the Act, itself provides the opportunity for determining the quantum of alimony or maintenance to a Hindu wife or husband, it would not be necessary to look back to the history of English Matrimonial Law, for guidance. In this connection, we can usefully refer to the following passage in the commentary of Mulla's Hindu Law (13th Edition) at page 740, which reads as under: ""In view of the express provisions of this section it is not necessary for the Court, while determining the amount of permanent alimony or permanent maintenance to a Hindu wife or husband, to look back to the history of English Matrimonial Law nor need the Court concern itself with any difference or change of opinion expressed in particular cases in England. There is no reason for assumption of a fixed arithmetical rule even in case of allotment of permanent alimony where the decree is only for judicial separation. The mode of assessment of the amount of permanent alimony or permanent maintenance is entirely a matter of discretion of the Court, A rough working rule may have some usefulness in an application for maintenance pendente lite and it is submitted that even if any such working rule is evolved as of some guidance in case of such interim orders it is not necessary nor desirable that for assessment or permanent alimony or permanent maintenance there should be any notional or prima facie rule which has regard to arithmetical proportions. The question cannot be one of arithmetic and must remain entirely of discretion."" 5. As a perusal of Section 25 of the Act would be sufficient to show, how the express provisions contained therein lay down the approach to be made by the Courts determining the amount of maintenance payable to a wife or husband, if and when sought, the same are excerpted; ""25(1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall, while the applicant remains unmarried, pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant and the conduct of the parties, it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immoveable property of the respondent. (2) If the Court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has made an order under Sub-section (1), it may, at the instance of either party, vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just.Gowri vs Satish on 3 August, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/614268/ 2(3) If the Court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been made under this Section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she has not remarried chaste, or, if such party is the husband, that he has sexual intercourse with any woman outside wed-lock, it shall rescind the order."" 6. That the lower Court's approach in the matter of determining the amount of maintenance is based on the provisions of Section 25 of the Act, becomes apparent from a reading of para-21 of its Judgment. We cannot, therefore, find any fault in the approach made by the lower Court in the matter. Sri Sundaraswamy, learned Counsel for the appellant, however, submitted that the lower Court has overlooked the fact that the appellant would need separate residential accommodation, in that, the accommodation she has found in nor parents house, cannot be regarded as a permanent one. It was also urged by him that even otherwise, the amount of alimony awarded by the lower Court cannot be regarded as adequate, oven on a modest estimate. The submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellant are not devoid of force. It is seen that the appellant is admittedly residing with her parents. It is not said by her that she is thinking in terms of having a separate residence. Though possibly the need for the appellant to have a separate residence might have weighed with the lower Court while determining the total amount of permanent alimony payable to the appellant, we find that the amount awarded by the lower Court towards permanent alimony of the wife is rather Inadequate in the facts and circumstances of the case. As can be seen from the provisions of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the means of the parties and their conduct are the primary considerations which should weigh with the Court in assessing the permanent alimony awardable thereunder. In the instant case, it is seen that the wife-appellant's gross income is Rs. 1,300/- per month, while the husband-respondent's gross income is Rs. 3,600/- per month. It is also seen, as rightly pointed out by the lower Court in its Judgment, that it is the husband-respondent who was guilty of desertion and cruelty. If regard is had to the totality of circumstances, particularly the lower side of the income of the appellant and the higher side of the income of the respondent and further the requirement of separate residence for the appellant, the amount of Rs. 200/- per month fixed by the lower Court as the permanent alimony payable by the respondent to the appellant-wife appears to be rather inadequate. However, having an over-all view of the matter, we consider that it would be just, proper and reasonable to enhance the monthly maintenance amount made payable by the respondent to the appellant from Rs. 200/- per month to Rs. 350/- per month. 7. What now remains for our consideration is the point as to whether the lower Court was in error in refusing to direct the respondent to return the articles claimed by the appellant as belonging to her. The appellant, in her petition, M.C.No.81/1981, has, among other things, prayed for directing the respondent to return to her, her belongings listed in the schedule to the petition. The articles so listed in the schedule are items 1 to 7. Among other things, the articles include gold jewels, sliver articles, stainless steel vessels, costly German Vioglesnder Camera, new Godrej Almirah, costly silk sarees and vast presentation articles given at the wedding. The petitioner- appellant has claimed return of the said articles or alternatively their value. It is seen that the lower Court has rejected the said prayer of the plaintiff on the ground that the evidence of the petitioner-appellant adduced with reference to the articles described in the schedule to the petition was not corroborated and also onGowri vs Satish on 3 August, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/614268/ 3",['25']

Gokhale, J. Page 1241 1. This Appeal by a wife seeks to challenge the common judgment and order dated 29th June 2004 passed by a Judge of the Family Court at Mumbai. The Appellant wife had filed Petition No. A-1822 of 1992 on 23rd November 1992 in the Family Court seeking judicial separation under section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty and ill-treatment. The Respondent husband had filed Matrimonial Suit No. B-96 of 1992 on 23rd December 1992 seeking a declaration that the purported marriage between the Appellant and the Respondent performed on 19th January 1983 be declared null and void since the Appellant was not a Hindu prior to her marriage and that she had not been converted to Hinduism any time prior to the marriage. The learned Judge of the Family Court had accepted this submission of the Respondent that the Appellant had not been converted to Hinduism prior to Page 1242 the marriage and, therefore, the marriage between a Hindu and a non-Hindu could not be said to be a valid marriage under section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The learned Judge, therefore, held that he had no jurisdiction to try and entertain the petition filed by the Appellant wife for judicial separation or the one filed by the Respondent husband seeking a declaration of nullity of the marriage, since neither of the petitions could be said to be maintainable under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. He, therefore, dismissed both the petitions by the said order which is under challenge. 2. The Respondent herein is an industrialist and a businessman of some standing. He is stated to be an engineer and used to run a company by name Technical Products Corporation which manufactured small engineering equipments such as screws, nuts and bolts. He had a factory in MIDC, Andheri, Mumbai. He had divorced his earlier wife one Sugandha Rani some time in December 1982. He had two children; one son and one daughter from his earlier marriage. The Appellant herein was working initially as a clerk and later on in an administrative position in Respondent's company for about 5 years by the time of this divorce. She was a Catholic Christian by birth and her name was Magdhelene Pereira. Her father was a make-up artist in the film industry. The Appellant and the Respondent got married at the Markandeshwar Temple at Worli, Mumbai on 19th January 1983 according to Hindu Vedic Rites. The fact that such a marriage did take place and also that it was performed according to the Hindu Vedic Rites is not disputed by the Respondent husband. Thereafter, the parties on the same evening went to a church at Sakinaka, Mumbai, where they have undergone a church marriage. 3. Two daughters were born from this marriage; the elder one by name Ritu born on 10th December 1983 and the younger one by name Richa born on 3rd August 1986. The parties have lived together at the bungalow of the Respondent at Indu Park Co-operative Housing Society at Four BungalowsSmt. Madhavi Ramesh Dudani vs Ramesh K. Dudani on 1 November, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1840379/ 1area in Andheri (West). It appears that over the years differences developed between them and the Appellant wife has been staying away since about 7th March 1991. 4. The above referred petition for judicial separation was filed on 23rd November 1992. Prayer (a) thereof sought judicial separation, prayer (b) continuation of the custody of the minor daughters with her and prayer (c) her stridhan articles. Prayer (f) sought a partition of the matrimonial home at Indu Park so as to enable her to stay in one part thereof. Prayer (d) was an interim prayer not to sell, alienate or encumber that house and prayer (e) sought an injunction that she should not be restrained from entering into the same. Prayer (g) sought a permanent maintenance of Rs. 15,000/-per month for herself and Rs. 7,500/-per month for the minor daughters. Interim maintenance was sought at Rs. 10,000/-to herself and Rs. 5,000/-per month for the minor daughters. The Appellant took out an interim application therein making two-fold prayers. The first part of prayer was concerning the matrimonial home. Prayers (a) and (b) were to restrain the Respondent from selling, alienating or encumbering or creating any third party rights in the above referred matrimonial home. The second part was regarding maintenance. Prayer (e) was to grant an amount of Rs. 10,000/-to herself and Page 1243 Rs. 5,000/- to each of the daughters during the pendency and disposal of the petition. 5. The Respondent filed a written statement containing a counter-claim and denied the allegations of cruelty and ill-treatment made in the petition for judicial separation. He contended that since the marriage was not between two Hindus, the Appellant could not claim any relief in the proceeding under the Hindu Marriage Act and that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the same. Alternatively, however, he prayed that in case the court held that it had the jurisdiction, the Respondent be granted a decree of divorce for the reason that in fact he had been treated with cruelty. As far as this counter-claim is concerned, the Appellant filed her written statement thereto on 24th September 1993 and submitted that she had become a Hindu and that the court did have jurisdiction. 6. As pointed out above, the Respondent had filed the other matrimonial suit for a declaration being Suit No. B-96 of 1992 praying that the marriage between the two be declared null and void. The Appellant filed her written statement thereto contending that she was converted to Hinduism prior to the marriage and therefore there was no question of granting any decree as prayed by him. Both the proceedings were tried together and issues were framed by the learned Judge. The relevant issues are Issue Nos. 8 and 9 in Petition No. A-1822 of 1992 and Issue No. 1 in Suit No. B-96 of 1992. These issues read as follows:- ""Issue No. 8: Does the Respondent prove that the marriage between him and the Petitioner is null and void ab-initio as on date of marriage, the Petitioner belonged to Christian Religion and was not property converted to Hinduism? Issue No. 9:Smt. Madhavi Ramesh Dudani vs Ramesh K. Dudani on 1 November, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1840379/ 2Whether the petition is maintainable, if the Petitioner is a Christian as the same is filed under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act? Issue No. 1: Does the Petitioner prove that the marriage solemnised on 19.1.1983 between himself and the Respondent is null and void as the Respondent was belonging to Christian Religion on the date of marriage and no valid marriage was performed between the parties under the Hindu Marriage Act? 7. Thereafter the parties led evidence. The Appellant led her own evidence and that of one Mr. Mehta who had attended the marriage. The Respondent examined himself. The matter was argued thereafter. The learned Judge relied upon a few judgments including those of this High Court and that of Kerala High Court and came to the conclusion that since one of the parties was not Hindu, he did not have any jurisdiction to try and entertain the proceedings. It is however material to note that the evidence was recorded on all the issues arising in the matter, i.e. with respect to cruelty by either of the parties, the reasons for their separation, the allegations against each other, and their financial position to decide the question of maintenance. However, as stated above, the learned Judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction and, therefore, dismissed both the proceedings by the impugned order on that finding. He did not give any finding on the other issues. In para 28 he held that therefore the issues on cruelty, judicial separation, maintenance and permanent alimony did not survive. It is this order which is under challenge. Page 1244 8. Before we consider the arguments of the counsel for both the parties, we may refer to the findings given by the learned Judge of the Family Court. In para 21 of the impugned judgment, the learned Judge referred to the fact that in the original petition filed by wife, there was no reference to the Shudhikaran ceremony, but it was through an amendment made in May 1995 that this plea was brought on record. He has also referred to the fact that the Appellant has deposed that she performed pooja and havan on various occasions after the marriage along with the Respondent. She has not stated so in the petition as such. The learned Judge has also noted the fact that after the marriage according to the Hindu Vedic Rites, the parties went to a church for a Christian marriage. In para 22 of the judgment, he has noted that no particulars of the Shudhikaran ceremony like the date and place of performance and the witnesses present were given. He has noted that her witness Mr. Dhirubhai Mehta has stated that he witnessed the Shudhikaran ceremony though in the cross-examination, he has stated that he did not know what is meant thereby. The learned Judge has, therefore, held at the end of para 22 that she has miserably failed that she has undergone Shudhikaran ceremony. 9. With respect to her participation in various religious ceremonies as a Hindu, the learned Judge has noted that the Appellant was performing pooja, havan and various tenets of Hinduism. He has also noted that she performed pooja at the residence, factory premises and when the couple went on tour to religious places like Badrinath. She has stated that Dhirubhai Mehta accompanied them and Mr. Mehta in his statement stated that she performed pooja and havan at different places. It wasSmt. Madhavi Ramesh Dudani vs Ramesh K.

Sikri, J. 1. The appellant herein is duped by the respondent. The respondent, who was already married to one Amarjeet Kaur suppressing this marriage and pretending that he was still a bachelor, married the appellant on 11.12.1977, according to Sikh rites and ceremonies at Jalandhar. Both of them lived as husband and wife for number of years at the matrimonial house, i.e. A-447, defense Colony, New Delhi. Two daughters were born out of this wedlock, on 18.2.1981 and 31.5.83 respectively. According to the appellant, she decided to complete her B.A. Degree, which she had left incomplete earlier before marriage. Therefore, she picked up her studies again. In April 1991, she went to Paghwara, Punjab, to take the exams. On 13.6.1991 when she returned, her mother-in-law did not allow her to go inside the house. She was, thus, deserted by the respondent. At that time she came to know that the respondent was already married to Smt. Amarjeet Kaur. 2. The appellant did not swallow this insult to her. She filed a criminal case against the respondent for committing bigamy (in this case the respondent has been convicted). She also filed a petition under Sections 18 and 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (in short the 'Act') claiming recovery of maintenance and right of residence from the respondent. She claimed decree of maintenance at the rate of Rs. 12,000/- per month plus rent of residence and also prayed for necessary charge on the matrimonial house A-447, defense Colony for securing the right of maintenance. The petition was filed as an indigent person under Order XXXIII Rule 1 CPC, which was allowed. 3. This petition was originally filed in this Court. On 28.8.1997, order was passed directing the respondent to pay interim maintenance of Rs. 5,000/- to the petitioner. Vide order dated 2.3.2000, the Court ordered for payment of a further sum of Rs. 10,000/- to the appellant by way of interim maintenance. Thereafter, vide order dated 28.4.2000 further maintenance of Rs. 5,000/- was allowed. Application for interim maintenance was ultimately decided by the Court vide order dated 11.1.2002 granting interim maintenance of Rs. 400/- per month. The quantum was challenged by the appellant by filing appeal before the Division Bench, which enhanced the maintenance to Rs. 700/- from 1.8.2003 vide orders dated 25.7.2002. On further appeal to the Supreme Court, this interim maintenance was enhanced to Rs. 1,500/- per month with effect from May 2004 till the disposal of the suit, vide order dated 21.4.2004. 4. On enhancement of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts, the petition was transferred to the District Court on 27.11.2003. The respondent did not file the written statement and ultimately vide order dated 11.10.2004 the right of the respondent to file the written statement was struck off. The appellant appeared in the witness-box and submitted her affidavit by way of evidence (Ex. PW 1/1). She also proved various other documents showing financial status of the respondent as well as the appellant's mother-in-law. The respondent did not lead any evidence.Smt. Narinder Pal Kaur Chawla vs Shri Manjeet Singh Chawla on 20 September, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/534776/ 15. The learned trial court, however, has dismissed the petition of the petitioner vide impugned order dated 13.7.2005. This petition is not dismissed on merits but on the ground that such a petition filed by the appellant under Section 18 of the Act claiming maintenance from the respondent is not maintainable as the appellant is not a legally wedded ""wife"" of the respondent. This finding is arrived at by the learned trial court on the premise that since the respondent was already married to one Amarjeet Kaur, his second marriage with the appellant was clearly void and of no legal effect. It is held that under Section 18 of the Act, petition can be filed by a legally wedded wife and not by a person who is not lawfully married and for this conclusion the learned trial court has drawn the support from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya v. State of Gujarat AIR 2005 SC 2141 and of this Court in the case of Suresh Khullar v. Vijay Khullar II (2002) DMC 131. Challenging this judgment, present appeal is filed. 6. The appellant argued the appeal herself whereas Mr. Ranjit Singh, Advocate, appeared for the respondent. Leraned Counsel for the respondent relied upon the reasoning given by the trial court in dismissing the petition of the appellant herein. His submission was that since the appellant was not legally wedded wife, she could not file petition under Section 18 of the Act, as held by the Supreme Court in Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya (supra). 7. The appellant, on the other hand, submitted that it is the respondent who suppressed the factum of first marriage and on his representation that he was a bachelor, the appellant and the appellant married the respondent on 11.12.1977. They lived as man and wife for 14 years before the appellant was denied entry into the house and was deserted by the respondent on 14.4.1991. In such circumstances, it was not open to the respondent to take advantage of his own wrong and deny maintenance to the appellant, who was not a ""concubine"" of the respondent, who lived with him by marrying him. 8. We have given deep thoughts to the respective contentions of the parties and have also gone through the record. The admitted position, which has emerged on the record of this case, may be taken note of as that will have important bearing on the outcome of the case: a) the respondent did not file any written statement to the petition for maintenance filed by the appellant and the right of the respondent to file the written statement was struck off. The appellant examined herself as PW-1 and proved various documents. The respondent has not led any evidence. Therefore, the material, which has come on record as proved by the appellant, remains unchallenged, there being no evidence in rebuttal by the respondent. b) the parties had married on 11.12.1977 according to Sikh rites and ceremonies. They lived together till 14.4.1991, i.e. for almost 14 years. During this period, two daughters were born out of the said wedlock. c) As per the testimony of the appellant, at the time of marriage the respondent had pretended that he was a bachelor. The appellant, therefore, had no knowledge that the respondent was already married. Not only that, for a long period of 14 years when the parties lived as husband and wife in the matrimonial house at defense Colony, the first wife had not surfaced nor was there anySmt.

Thereafter, interim maintenance was fixed at Rs. 400/- per month by the Single Judge of this Court vide order dated 11.1.2002. The Division Bench enhanced that maintenance to Rs. 700/- from 1.8.2003 by orders dated 25.7.2002. This was further enhanced to Rs. 1500/- per month with effect from May, 2004 by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Order dated 21.4.2004 passed by the Supreme Court fixing maintenance is reported as Narinder Pal Kaur Chawla v. Manjeet Singh Chawla and reads as under: 1. Leave granted. 2. Heard the petitioner in person and leraned Counsel appearing for the respondent. We have also perused the counter affidavits and rejoinders along with the written submissions filed by the parties. 3. The present appeal arises out of an interim order dated 11.1.2002 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi in the course of proceedings Instituted by the present appellant claiming to be the second wife of the respondent for grant of maintenance to her under Section 18 read with Section 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act [for short the Act]. The learned Single Judge on the original side of the High Court in the pending proceeding under the Act has by order dated 11.1.2002 granted an interim maintenance of Rs. 400/- per month to the wife. 4. The wife appealed to the Division Bench of the High Court. By order dated 25.7.2003 which is the subject matter of this appeal, the interim maintenance has been increased to Rs. 700/- per month. Not satisfied with the increase In the amount of interim maintenance granted by the Division Bench, the wife has approached this Court seeking farther enhancement of rate of interim maintenance. 5. By this appeal, Interim maintenance @ Rs. 12,000/- per month has been claimed on the ground that the respondent/husband has taken voluntary retirement from the Bank's services and has received substantial amount of retiral benefits. It is stated that he is possessed of valuable properties and assets which are sufficient to pay higher amount of maintenance to the wife to enable her to maintain a reasonable standard of living to which the parties are accustomed. 6. The husband is contesting the maintenance proceeding both on the ground of competence of the present wife to claim maintenance and the quantum. 7. Normally, this Court would not have entertained this appeal as it is directed against an order fixing only interim maintenance pending adjudication of claim of maintenance by the wife under the Act: On the prima facie evidence with regard to the social and financial status of the parties, this Court finds that interim maintenance of Rs. 700/- per month fixed by the Division Bench of the High Court is extremely low. Therefore, after notice issuing on the Special Leave Petition, this appeal is entertained.Smt.

Facts giving rise to this writ petition, briefly stated, are: The petitioner filed a petition for divorce in the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ghaziabad which are registered marriage petition No. 679 of 2000. In paragraph 11 of the plaint it was mentioned that the suit is tentatively valued at Rs. 1,00,000/-and Court-fees of Rs. 37.50 for divorce and Rs. 37.50 for return of articles have been separately paid. The 3rd Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) vide its judgment dated 31-1-2002 granted decree of divorce and also directed for return of articles as mentioned in the plaint. Against the judgment and decree dated 31-1-2002 passed by the 3rd Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ghaziabad a Civil Appeal No. 45 of 2002 was filed by the defendant-respondent in the Court of the District Judge, Ghaziabad. In the aforesaid appeal an application 13-C was filed by the petitioner who was respondent in the appeal stating that the District Judge has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. XIII Additional District Judge heard the counsel for the parties and rejected the application of the petitioner 13-C vide its order dated 27-8-2002. Petitioner by this writ petition has challenged the order dated 27-8-2002. Sri M. K. Gupta counsel for the petitioner raised the following submission in support of the writ petition:-- 1. A petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce is not capable of giving any pecuniary valuation hence appeal against the judgment and decree of 3rd Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) will lie to the High Court since it is the High Court which has residuary power or hearing the appeal. Reliance has been placed on a Full Bench Judgment of this Court in 1961 All LJ 232 : (AIR 1961 All 395), Paras Ram v. Janki Bai alias Savitri. 2. The valuation of suit given by the petitioner in Marriage Petition No. 679 of 2000 of amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- was irrelevant and the said valuation cannot be determinative of the forum of appeal and such a valuation is to be ignored as a petition under Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act is incapable of valuation in the existing law. 4. I have heard counsel for the petitioner and perused the record. The only question raised in the writ petition is as to whether the appeal against the judgment and decree of the 3rd Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division) dated 31-1-2002 will lie to the District Judge or to the High Court?Smt. Shalu Sharma vs Ajay Sharma on 4 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1038932/ 15. For considering the question raised in the writ petition it is necessary to have a look over the statutory provision governing the right of appeal under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 relates to appeal from decrees and orders. Section 28 of the Act is extracted below:-- ""28. Appeal from decrees and orders,-- (1) All decrees made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (2) Orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act under Section 25 or Section 26 shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable, if they are not Interim orders, and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, (3) There shall be no appeal under this section on the subject of costs only. (4) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order."" 6. The words governing the forum of the appeal are contained in Section 28(1), which are ""such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil Jurisdiction. Thus for finding out as to in which Court the appeal shall He, it has to be looked into, to which Court appeal ordinarily lies from the decision of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. Section 3(b) defines ""District Court"" in following manner:-- ""3(b). ""District Court"" means, in any area for which there is a city Civil Court, that Court, and in any other area the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, and includes any other Civil Court which may be specified by the State Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in this Act."" 7. There is no dispute that the Court of Civil Judge has been notified by the State Government as District Court having jurisdiction in the matters dealt with in this Act. Admittedly in the present case petition for divorce was filed before the Court of Civil Judge. The classes of the Court and the forum for filing appeal against the judgment and decree from the original civil jurisdiction are governed by the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Court Act, 1887. Section 3 of the aforesaid Act, provided classes of Civil Court, Section 3 of the said Act is quoted below:-- ""3. Class of Courts, ........... .There shall be following classes of Civil Courts under this Act, namely; 1. The Court of the District Judge;Smt. Shalu Sharma vs Ajay Sharma on 4 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1038932/ 22. The Court of the Additional Judge; 3. The Court of the Subordinate Judge; and 4. The Court of the Munsif. 8. In its application to the State of Uttar Pradesh, in item (3) of Section 3 the word ""Subordinate"" has been substituted by the word ""Civil Court"". Thus in the State of Uttar Pradesh the third category of Court is a Court of Civil Judge. Section 21 of the Act provides for appeal from subordinate Judge and Munsif. Section 21 of the Act is quoted below;-- ""21. Appeals from Subordinate Judges and Munsifs.--(1) Save as aforesaid, an appeal from a decree or order of a Subordinate Judge shall be- (a) to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in any proceeding arising out of which the decree or order was made did not exceed five thousand rupees; and (b) to the High Court in any other case; (2) Save as aforesaid an appeal from a decree or order of a Munsif shall lie to the District Judge. (3) Where the function of receiving any appeals which lie to the District Judge under Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) has been assigned to an Additional Judge, the appeals may be preferred to the Additional Judge. (4) The High Court may, with the previous sanction of the State Government direct, by notification in the Official Gazette, that appeals lying to the District Judge under Sub-section (2) from all or any of the decrees or orders of any Munsif shall be preferred to the Court of such subordinate Judge as may be mentioned in the notification, and the appeals shall thereupon be preferred accordingly. 9.

The present application under consideration has been filed by defendant No. 1 under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (―CPC for short) read with Sections 9 and 151 of the CPC, Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Section 5 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 for rejection of the plaint. 2. The present suit has been filed by the plaintiff No. 1 praying for the following reliefs : a) Grant an anti suit injunction restraining the defendant No. 1 from filing, instituting and continuing, inter alia, any custody proceedings against the Plaintiff in Dubai and from prosecuting any such proceedings already filed; b) Declare that the marriage contracted under Islamic Law by the Defendant No. 1 is void by virtue of its bigamous nature;Vibha Suri & Ors. vs Vikram Suri & Ors. on 23 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1028191/ 1c) Declare that the children would not be subject to the Islamic Law being from Hindu Marriage solemnized and registered under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955;           d)      Declare that the mother is the guardian of the                   children     under   the     Hindu   Minority   and Guardianship Act, 1956. 3. The brief facts leading up to the filing of the present suit are that the plaintiff No. 1 and defendant No. 1 were married at Lucknow on 11th March, 1996 and the marriage was registered at New Delhi on 3rd November, 1998. The parties moved to Riyad, Saudi Arabia in 1998 and then to Dubai in 2000. Two children were born of the wedlock, being the minor plaintiff Nos. 2 and 3 herein. 4. By a letter dated 12th December, 2007 from the Indian Embassy at Cairo (defendant No. 3 herein) addressed to plaintiff No. 1 at 11, RBI Road, New Hyderabad, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh the plaintiff No. 1's parents got to know that the husband of their daughter plaintiff No. 1 i.e. defendant No. 1 had converted to Islam and married a lady by the name of Wassima Khan and the letter enquired if the marriage of plaintiff No. 1 with defendant No. 1 had been dissolved. By letter dated 15th January, 2008 plaintiff No. 1 informed defendant No. 3 that the earlier marriage was subsisting as it had not been dissolved and that defendant No. 1's subsequent marriage was bigamous and void. Defendant No. 1 moved out of the matrimonial home on 1st February, 2008. However, on 20th February, 2008 both the parties negotiated an amicable resolution/ settlement of the dispute and reduced the same into writing. The said agreement contained clauses as to the division of the matrimonial assets as well as visitation rights etc. by virtue of which defendant No. 1 was allowed to visit the minor children on weekends. The said agreement also contained a clause to the effect that if either party violated any term thereof, the other party would have sole custody of the children. 5. It is the plaintiff No. 1's averment that defendant No. 1 started displaying anger towards her and started taunting her etc. even in the presence of the minor children who witnessed this scene every weekend. Plaintiff No. 1, for the sake of her children, continued to be patient with defendant No. 1 despite his unruly and abusive behaviour. 6. On 11th June, 2008, plaintiff No. 1 received an e-mail from defendant No. 1 informing her that he had obtained an order from a Court in Dubai restraining her from moving the minor children out of Dubai. Apprehending that defendant No. 1 may file proceedings for custody of the children in Dubai - and considering the fact that under the Shariat law children must necessarily reside with the father if he so desires - the plaintiff No. 1 filed the present proceedings as the filing of any proceeding before the Dubai Court would be improper since the same was forum non-conveniens and also since the parties would not be governed by their personal law in Dubai but by the Shariat law. Further, defendant No. 1 through the order of the Dubai Court has curtailed the civil and personal liberties of the two minor children by restraining their travel outside Dubai. Thus the present suit was filedVibha Suri & Ors. vs Vikram Suri & Ors. on 23 February, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1028191/ 2before this Court. 7. Defendant No. 1 has raised preliminary objections to the present suit by filing a written statement wherein the following has been submitted :- a) No action lies before the Civil Court as the remedies sought by the plaintiffs are available under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and as such, the present suit is barred by law. b) This Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the present suit, on reasons elucidated in paragraph 7 of the written statement. c) As per the agreement between the parties dated 20th February, 2008, a total of US$ 19,25,000/- were to be transferred in favour of the plaintiff No. 1 by defendant No. 1. Out of this amount, assets and property worth approximately Rs.10,50,00,000/- have already been transferred in favour of plaintiff No. 1 and only the amount of US$ 30,000 is left to be transferred. d) When most of the money had been transacted, plaintiff No. 1 began denying the defendant No. 1's visitation rights as regards the children and tried to frustrate all channels of communication between them. e) Apprehending that plaintiff No. 1 might one day take the children and exit Dubai, defendant No. 1 filed an application in the Dubai Court praying that plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 may not be taken outside Dubai. The said prayer was granted. 8. Having perused the submissions contained in the written statement, this Court makes a note of the fact that when an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC is under consideration, as per well settled law it is only the averments contained in the plaint that are to be seen and considered.

In the application for rejection of plaint being I.A. No. 10514/2008, defendant No. 1 has contended that the reliefs prayed for by the plaintiff No. 1 cannot be granted by way of the present civil suit as the remedies available, if any, are under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the instant civil suit is barred by law as per the provisions of Section 4 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Section 5 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956.

By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the appellant husband seeks to challenge the judgment and decree dated 05.02.2001 passed by the learned trial court whereby the divorce petition filed by the appellant herein under Section 13 (1) (ia) & (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act was dismissed. 2. Brief facts of the case relevant for deciding the present appeal are that the marriage between the parties was solemnized on 13.02.1987 according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and a daughter 'Gudia' was born from the wedlock on 5.1.1988 . The case set up by the appellant in the divorceShri Amar Lal Arora vs Smt. Shashi Bala on 15 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/233180/ 1petition was that the respondent was under the influence of her parents right from the beginning of the marriage and her parents interfered in their affairs. It was also alleged that the respondent never showed happiness in residing with the appellant and never fulfilled her matrimonial obligations. It was also the case of the appellant that the respondent avoided normal sexual life with the appellant and thereby caused mental agony to him. It was also stated that the respondent left for her parental home on 13.12.1987 on the pretext of attending a marriage of some relation and when the appellant went to bring her back to the matrimonial home on 20.12.1987 her parents refused to send her back with him. The appellant again went to bring back the respondent on 23.12.1987 and also on 25.12.1987 along with his father, maternal uncle and two other relations and requested the parents of the respondent to send her but they refused. It was also alleged that the respondent herself also insulted and ill treated them. According to the appellant, when the daughter was born, he was not allowed to see her and was threatened to be killed. The appellant wrote letters dated 12.3.88, 16.3.88 and 25.3.88 requesting the respondent to re-join the matrimonial home but she refused. The appellant, therefore, filed a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for restitution of their conjugal rights and a compromise was arrived at between the parties and the respondent re- joined the matrimonial home on 27.7.89 but the respondent did not mend her behaviour and that she became more cruel and violent and started insulting and humiliating him frequently and also did not take interest in the household affairs and finally left the matrimonial home on 30.9.89. The appellant has also alleged that he was threatened of dire consequences to his life as well as that of his relations on various dates i.e. on 1.10.89, 6.4.91 and in fact was implicated in a criminal case under Section 498-A/406 IPC. It has also been alleged by the appellant that the police did not take any action against the respondent and her family members on his complaint and the respondent failed to join the matrimonial home despite his repeated requests and in this manner she willfully ill-treated him and finally deserted him. The appellant thus filed a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion which vide judgment and decree dated 5.2.01 was dismissed and feeling aggrieved with the same, the appellant has preferred the present petition. 3. The petition was contested by the respondent wife and she claimed that just after about one and half month of marriage, the appellant and his parents started raising demands for colour T.V, scooter and cash of Rs.20,000/- and as her parents could not meet the said demands ,therefore the appellant and his family members started ill-treating her, beat her and threatened her of dire consequences and made her life hell. As per the respondent, she wrote to her parents about her miserable condition vide letters dated 2.6.87 and 11.6.87 and 13.6.87. It was further claimed by the respondent that she was severely beaten and thrown out of the matrimonial home on 29.6.87 and that efforts for compromise/reconciliation were made and in December, 1997 a 'Biradari' meeting was held in which it was settled that the appellant would take her to the matrimonial home after 40 days of delivery. The respondent further alleged that the appellant did not take her back to the matrimonial home even after 40 days of delivery of the child on 5.1.88 and that the family members of the appellant demanded that her entire salary be accounted for the period she stayed at her parental home. It was also alleged that the appellant and his family members did not come to see her and the baby child even after due intimation. It was also alleged by the respondent that it was the meanness and greediness of the appellant's family which made her life hell and she was not allowed to enter the matrimonial home after being kicked out on 29.6.87. The respondent also alleged that after 2 days of her rejoining the matrimonial home she was beaten and humiliated andShri Amar Lal Arora vs Smt. Shashi Bala on 15 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/233180/ 2was pushed out of the matrimonial home with the allegations that she was not capable of giving birth to male child. 4. Based on the above pleadings of the parties, the learned trial court framed the following issues:- ""(i) Whether the respondent treated the appellant with cruelty? OPP (ii) Whether the respondent has deserted the appellant for a continuous period of two years before filing the petition? OPP (iii) Whether the appellant is entitled to the relief prayed for? OPP In support of his case, the appellant examined himself as PW- 1 besides examining his friend Shri Chander Shekhar Bhatia as PW-2. The respondent, on the other hand, examined only herself as RW-1 in support of her case. 5. The learned trial court on both the abovesaid issues returned findings against the appellant and in support of the respondent. On issue no.1 the learned trial court found that the appellant alone had been ill-treating, harassing and beating the respondent and threw her out of the matrimonial home. The trial court also found that the appellant had taken a false stand in the petition as well as in his evidence claiming that the respondent had left the matrimonial home on 30.9.89. The learned trial court further found that the letter written by the respondent and proved on record as Ex.PW1/1 instead of helping the case of the appellant supports the defence of the respondent who claimed that she was ready to join the appellant in her matrimonial home and she had wanted the appellant to visit her to take her back to the matrimonial home. The learned trial court further found that the statement and the undertaking given by the appellant in the proceedings filed by him under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act clearly proved that his behaviour was not proper otherwise he would not have given such an undertaking before the Court to keep the respondent happy and to maintain a congenial atmosphere in the home. The trial court also found the stand of the appellant claiming desertion of matrimonial home by the respondent on 13.12.87 as false and believed the version of the respondent of being thrown out of her matrimonial home on 24.9.89 and that the appellant treated the respondent with cruelty. 6. On Issue no. 2, the learned trial court from the record found that it is clear that the respondent never intended to leave the matrimonial home and she always wanted to stay with the appellant but only wanted to protect her self respect and to be treated well in her matrimonial home. The trial court also found that the appellant did not make any efforts to improve the atmosphere in the matrimonial home despite his undertaking given by him in the proceedings under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which made it clear that the intention of the appellant was to bring cohabitation permanently to an end. It observed that the respondent had reasonable cause for not returning to the matrimonial home and thus decided the issue in favour of the respondent. 7. Assailing the said judgment and decree of the learned trial court, Mr. P.S. Kem, learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that the appellant had duly proved his case by sufficientlyShri Amar Lal Arora vs Smt.

The Point that arises for consideration in C.M.A.No.1775 of 2010 is: Whether the Appellant/Husband is entitled to claim the relief of Divorce against the Respondent/Wife? The Contentions, Discussions and Findings on Points in both CMAs: 5.The Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Husband contends that the Common Order of the trial Court passed in O.P.Nos.993 of 2007 and 519 of 2008 are contrary to law, weight of evidence and probabilities of the case. 6.It is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/ Husband that both the parties never had any understanding right from the first day of the marriage, which was not taken into account by the trial Court. 7.According to the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Husband, the trial Court should have considered that the Respondent/Wife made frequent calls to the Police Department, when they resided together in United States of America and further, she had not discharged her duties as a daughter-in-law. 8.Lastly, it is the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Husband that the trial Court ought to have considered the evidence of R.W.1 (Wife) that she had not lived with the Appellant/ Husband under the same roof continuously for more than a month. 9.Per contra, it is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Wife that the trial Court had taken note of the material facts and circumstances of the case and after appreciating the oral and documentary evidence on record, had come to a clear conclusion that the Appellant/Husband was not entitled to claim the relief of dissolution of marriage in O.P.No.993 of 2007 and also that quite rightly the trial Court granted the relief of restitution of conjugal rights to the Respondent/Wife in O.P.No.519 of 2008, which need not be interfered with by this Court.R.Natarajan vs Sujatha Vasudevan on 29 August, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61450682/ 210.At this stage, it is not out of place for this Court to refer to the averments made by the Appellant/Husband in O.P.No.993 of 2007 on the file of the II Additional Family Court, Chennai. 11.The Appellant/Husband, in O.P.No.993 of 2007 filed under Section 13(1)(i)(ia)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, had averred that the marriage between him and the Respondent/Wife took place on 25.02.2002 at Chennai according to Hindu Rites and Customs and from the very beginning of the marriage, the Respondent/Wife was so arrogant, indifferent and used to abuse him in filthy and ugly language and he had tolerated all the cruelty and cruel treatment meted out to him. Further, he hoped that the Respondent/Wife would be alright and would mend her ways in the near future. But, the same ended in vain. Also, he averred that the Respondent/Wife deserted him on 24.04.2005 without just or sufficient cause and ran away from the matrimonial home and therefore, he was forced to be alone from 24.04.2005 till date. As such, he was entitled to divorce the Respondent/Wife based on the reason of cruelty and wilful desertion for more than one year. 12.As a result of the wedlock, a female child was born on 08.02.2003 viz., Varshinee at the Respondent/Wife's parents house. Further, the Respondent/Wife failed and neglected to discharge her parental duty as a mother and he was even prevented from seeing his child by the Respondent/Wife and her father. Furthermore, all sorts of pin pricks had been caused by the Respondent/Wife on the motivation of her father. 13.Earlier, the Appellant/Husband filed a Petition for restitution of conjugal rights in O.P.No.605 of 2006 on the file of the II Additional Family Court, Chennai with a fond hope that the Respondent/Wife would be tamed on the belief that he being a pious Hindu and things would be alright in due course, which ended in vain. The Respondent/Wife was not prepared to reunite and therefore, he was forced to file a Petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion and there was no possibility of reunion with the Respondent due to her incorrigible attitude. 14.In the counter filed by the Respondent/Wife, it is, inter alia, mentioned that she went to United States of America with the Appellant/Petitioner (Husband) and when she conceived, the Appellant had not acted properly and therefore, she went to San Francisco and stayed at her cousin's house and the matter reached the ears of her parents and at the instance of relatives of both parties, a talk was held wherein the Appellant/Husband assured to behave properly. She gave birth to a female child Varshinee on 08.02.2003. 15.Since the Appellant/Husband's project at United States of America was over, they returned back to India. Prior to that, both parties discussed about the stay in Chennai on return from America. When she suggested to stay away from the parents of the Appellant/ Husband, he suggested on return from USA itself that she should stay at her parents house to avoid any unpleasantness at the hands of his mother, promising that he would later come and take her back. But, the Appellant/Defendant did not turnup. 16.The Appellant/Husband had a duty to lead a happy matrimonial life with her. But, for reasons best known to him, he avoided her and because of the attitude of the Appellant/Husband, her female baby had suffered and now she grew up and the absence of father was placing her in greatR.Natarajan vs Sujatha Vasudevan on 29 August, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61450682/ 3","['9', '13']"

The undisputed facts of the case are that at the time of marriage of the plaintiff Siddagangamma with the 1 st-defendant Basappa, the first wife by name Hanumakka was alive. In the suit, the plaintiff sought for maintenance and for a charge on the properties belonging to the first defendant. The husband-appellant while admitting the subsistence of his marriage with one Hanumakka denied his marriage with the plaintiff and also the factum of a child having been born to their wedlock. Further, he contested the suit mainly on the ground that the suit as being not maintainable in view of his marriage with the plaintiff as being null and void by virtue of the provisions of Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which came into force on 18-5-1955 disentitling her claim for maintenance. Both the Courts have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff's suit for maintenance under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, which came into force on 21-12-1956 as being maintainable inspite of affirmation of the issue that her marriage with the first-defendant as being null and void. This Court in KISHAN v. SAKHARABAI AND ANR., 1987(2) KLJ 357 has discussed the scope and ambit of Sections 11 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and as well as the scope and ambit of Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. The relevant observations are as follows: ""The argument of Sri V. Krishna Murthy is based on the principle that in the case of a wife pre-existing right to claim and receive maintenance is a must in law. He argued that when Section 5Basappa vs Siddagangamma on 10 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95752/ 1of H.M.Act declares the marriage between plaintiff-1 and the defendant void, the marriage is ipso jure void. Hence, even if the requisite Hindu ceremonies had been performed, the marriage became non-est and did not secure legal status of a wife to plaintiff-1 and she had no right to claim and receive maintenance. He further argued, proceeding on these lines, that such a right must be existing till a decree under the provisions of H.M.Act is passed and because of the decree so passed the status as wife must get extinguished and then only the ingredients of Section 25 of the H.M.Act would be satisfied. According to him, the use of the words ""husband and wife"" in Section 25 of the H.M.Act supported this argument and conclusion and therefore on a decree being passed in a petition under Section 11 of the H.M.Act, the so-called wife would not be entitled to claim and receive maintenance. When that is so, no question of such a so-called wife being conferred with a right to claim and receive maintenance under Section 25 of the H.M.Act can arise and much-less in any other proceeding or suit. He strongly relied on A.P.K. Narayanaswami Reddiar v. Padmanabhan (minor) and Ors. and disagreed with the views expressed in the decisions in Dayal Singh v. Bhajan Kaur . Govindrao Ranoji Musale v. Sou.Anandibai and Anr. . Smt.Rajeshbai and other v. Smt.Shanthabai and Shantaram Tukaram Patil and Ors.. !t may be stated here that he is supported by the decision in A.P.K. Narayanaswami Reddiar. (underlining by me) Sri N.A.Mandgi, learned Counsel, argued that H.A. & M.Act codifies the Hindu Law on Adoption and Maintenance and makes the provisions in that Act over-ride any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, by stating so in Section 4 of H.A. & M. Act. Therefore, Section 18 of the H.A. & M, Act would necessarily mean that only a wife who continues to have that legal status has the right to claim and receive maintenance provided she satisfies the conditions laid down therein. He made it clear by stating that Section 18 of the H.A. & M. Act does not permit a divorced wife or a wife whose marriage has been annulled by a decree of nullity or declared void by a decree of nullity to claim and receive maintenance. According to Sri N.A.Mandgi, the H.M. Act codifies the law on Hindu Marriage and therefore deals with all aspects about the Hindu Marriage and its incidents. His exposition is that Section 25 of the H.M.Act not only deals with passing of all the decress under the provisions of the Act, but also makes provision regarding the incidents arising on the passing of the decrees. The words ""any decree"" occurring in Section 25 of the H.M.Act cannot be given a restricted meaning so as to exclude a decree of nullity either contemplated under Section 11 or Section 12 of the H.M.Act. Plain reading of Section 25 of the H.M.Act, according to him, shows that at the time of passing of a decree or at any time subsequent thereto, the spouse concerned (stated as husband or wife in the Act) is given a right to make an application claiming maintenance, for adjudication by the Court exercising jurisdiction under that Act (hereinafter referred to as Matrimonial Court). Sri. N.A.Mandgi's argument further is that this is a special provision in the Act. It provides, for a specific right which arises under the conditions enumerated in the provision, the remedy and the forum to grant relief. When that is so, such a spouse has to claim such a relief in accordance with the provisions of Section 25 of the H.M.Act and it is not open to such spouse to claim maintenance in any other proceeding even if the question of declaring the marriage void in view of Section 5{i) of the H.M.Act arises for consideration in that proceeding i.e., in the ordinary Court.Basappa vs Siddagangamma on 10 March, 1992 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/95752/ 2One more aspect is available for consideration as expressed by V.B.Raju J., in State of Gujarat v. Chandramani Shankar Jadhavalal Sanghi and Ors. . This decision is cited in Dayal Singh's case and Narayanaswami Reddiar's case, in support of the proposition that Section 25 of the H.M.Act applies to all actions and proceedings under the Act, whether they be for judicial separation or dissolution of marriage or for decree or nullity. Through reading of this decisions shows that if an application is given subsequent to the passing of the decree for divorce or decree of nullity annulling of marriage or decree of nullity declaring the marriage void, an orderfor payment of alimony would be outside the scope of Section 25 of the H.M.Act, as, to be entitled to maintenance even after a decree under the provisions of the H.M.Act a wife has to have existing legal status as a wife. Therefore, maintenance under Section 25 of the H.M. Act can in law be granted only on the passing of a decree for judicial separation or for restitution of conjugal rights. It may be remembered in this connection that the aspect argued by Sri V.Krishnamurthy is slightly different in as much as it is based on the principle that but for the passing of the decree under the Act the parties ought to have been husband and wife. The view point would make granting of alimony possible even when a decree for divorce is granted while the same is ruled out by the decisions of the Gujarat High Court. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriaqe Act reads as follows: Section 5 Conditions for a Hindu Marriage; A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:- (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage, (ii) at the time of marriage, neither party- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity or epilepsy. (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage; (iv) the parties are not within the decrees of prohibited, relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not SAPINDAS of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.

As a result, the prayer for transfer has been rendered infructuous and is disposed of as such. C.M.No.25152-CII of 2008 Prayer in this application is for altering the petition titled as ""Ravinder Kaur v.

C.M.No.25153-CII of 2008 Prayer in this application is to dispense with the statutory period of six months provided under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, for grant of a divorce by mutual consent. The applicants have filed a petition under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, praying for dissolution of their marriage by grant of a decree of divorce by mutual consent. Parties have arrived at a mutually acceptable settlement duly reflected in the compromise Annexure P-4. The parties who are present in the Court state that they are residing separately since 01.12.2007 and after considering their circumstances have arrived at a firm decision that they would like to bring an end to this marriage, so as to enable them to start their lives afresh. I have heard counsel for the parties and perused the averments made in the application as also in the compromise Annexure P-4. The applicants have been residing separately since 01.12.2007. The petition for divorce has been pending for more than six months. I am satisfied that there is no legal impediment that would dis-entitle the applicants to such a relief. Consequently, the application is allowed and the period of six C.M.Nos.25149-53-CII of 2008 and -3 Transfer Application No. 125 of 2008 and C.O.No.7 of 2008 months provided under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act is waived. C.M. stands disposed of accordingly. C.O.No. 7 of 2008 The petitioners, namely, Ravinder Kaur and Harinder Singh Sandhu pray for grant of a decree of divorce by mutual consent under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The marriage between the petitioners was solemnized on 07.07.2007 at Ambala Cantt. They lived and co-habited as husband and wife at Bathinda. During their marriage, serious differences led them to start residing separately from 01.12.2007. Ravinder Kaur, Petitioner No.1, lodged FIR No.98, dated 13.05.2008 under Sections 406, 498-A, 34 IPC, at Police Station Mahesh Nagar, District Ambala. The husband Harinder Singh Sandhu, was, however, granted anticipatory bail. Harinder Singh Sandhu, filed a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, for restitution of conjugal rights at Bathinda. Petitioner No.1 thereafter filed a transfer petition praying for transfer of the petition filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act to a competent court of jurisdiction at Ambala. During the pendency of these cases, parties made a concerted attempt to effect a conciliation/settlement. Despite intervention of well wishers, friends and relatives, all attempts at reconciliation ended in failure. Faced with an uncertain future and ever increasing litigation, the petitioners decided that as their fundamental differences defy resolution, it would be appropriate to resolve their dispute amicably and jointly pray for grant of a divorce by mutual consent. In order to effectuate this decision, the petitioners executed a written compromise. The petitioners, who are present in person acknowledge their signatures on the compromise, which is taken on record as Ex. P-4. The contents of the compromise/settlement read as follows:-  C.M.Nos.25149-53-CII of 2008 and                            -4 Transfer Application No. 125 of 2008 andRavinder Kaur vs Harinder Singh Sandhu on 22 December, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/623863/ 2C.O.No.7 of 2008          ""That this compromise         deed is executed on 5th day of December, 2008 at Chandigarh between Ravinder Kaur w/o Harinder Singh Sandhu and d/o Capt.

425,"Delhi High Court Sharad Dutt vs Kiran on 3 November, 1997 Equivalent citations: II (1997) DMC 643 Author: A Srivastava Bench: A Srivastava JUDGMENT A.K. Srivastava, J. 1. This appeal has been filed against the judgment and order dated 30.11.1994 passed by Shri S.N. Chopra, Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi in HMA No. 584/88, Sharad Dutt Vs. Smt. Kiran. By the impugned order, the petition of the appellant for getting his marriage with the respondent annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short 'the Act') has been dismissed on merits. It was found to suffer from laches as well. The alternative prayer of the appellant for getting divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion has also been negatived by the learned Trial Court. 2. During the course of argument, in appeal, learned Counsel for appellant gave up the ground of desertion for seeking divorce and relied only on the main prayer in the petition for annulment of marriage under Section 11 of the Act and in the alternative for divorce under Section 13 of the Act on the grounds of cruelty only. 3. It order to appreciate the issues involved in this appeal, it would be pertinent to state the facts of the case in brief. The parties to this appeal got married on 9.12.1984. Appellant's mother is sister of respondent's father. They are thus, admittedly, first cousins within the definition of ""prohibited degrees of relationship"" given in Clause (g) of Section 3 of the Act. The fore-fathers of the parties were residing in District Jhang (now in Pakistan) which had a population of Hindus, Muslims besides other communities. Among the Hindus, there were Brahmins, called Panch-Jatia Brahmins consisting of five sub-castes, namely: Jaitely, Trik has, Mohlas, Jhingan and Kumarias. The appellant is Jhingan and the respondent was Jaitley before marriage. After marriage, the appellant and the respondent lived as husband and wife in appellant's house for some time and the respondent, admittedly, left the matrimonial home on 24.6.1985. Since then the parties have never lived together and consequently did not discharge their martial obligations to each other. As is apparent, disputes arose between the parties between 9.12.1984 and 24.6.1985. Efforts in vain are alleged to have been made for amicable settlement in the interest of both the parties. The respondent approached the Indian Women Welfare Association by her letter dated 26.6.1986. On 3.4.1987 an out of Court agreement reached between the parties (admittedly signed by the respondent) in the following terms: ""AAJ SANSTHA KE SADASYON AUR NIMINLIKHIT SADASYON KE SAAMNE KIRAN APNE DAHEJ KA SARA SAAMAAN LEKAR JA RAHI HAI. 14,000 RUPAIY (CHAUDHA HAZAAR RUPAIY) KA CHEQUE SANSTHA KE NAAM SE DIYA JA RAHA HAI, JO KIRAN KO TALAQ KE SAMEY DE DIYA JAYAIGA. AB KISI BHI TARAH KA LEN DEN BAKI NAHIN RAHA AUR NAHI KOI VYAKTI KISI TARAH KA KOI CASE KARENGE.

Mangalsutra was, no doubt, kept by mother of the appellant on the pretext that since there ceased to be any relationship of husband and wife between the appellant and the respondent, it was no longer needed by the respondent but later on, admittedly, when subsequent complaints were made by the respondent, the same was returned to the respondent in the Dowry Cell. 5. From the aforesaid out of Court settlement, the parties appeared to have agreed to bring to an end to the marriage by mutual consent, but it appears that the respondent did not agree to file a joint petition for divorce by mutual consent. Appellant's Advocate gave a notice to the respondent on 11.6.1988 (Ex. P.W.8/1). In response the respondent filed a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime against Women, Police Headquarters, New Delhi on 11.7.1988. Thereafter, another complaint was made by respondent on 1.8.1988 to the Police. On the basis of these two complaints, the proceedings before the Crime against Women Cell Started but nothing came out. Seeing the attitude of the respondent that she was not prepared to move a joint petition for divorce by mutual consent, the appelant moved the aforesaid petition for annulment of marriage under Section 11 of the Act and in the alternative for divorce under Section 13 of the Act on 12.9.1988. 6. When the Authorities of the Crime against Women Cell did not proceed against the appellant and her elatives in the aforesaid two complaints dated 11.7.1988 and 1.8.1988 made to them by the respondent and advised her to go to the Civil Court, the respondent filed a private complaint against the appellant, his mother, his uncle and his aunt under Sections 406/498-A of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. A copy of that private criminal complaint is at pages 449-465 of the paper book of the Trial Court though not formally proved. The appellant and his relatives moved to the High Court for quashing of that private criminal complaint and by judgment dated 24.2.1993 that complaint was quashed by this Court by R.L. Gupta, J. The judgment and order is Ex. P.W.12/1 at pages 765-771 of the paper book of the Trial Court. The following was observed in the aforesaid order quashing the criminal complaint of the respondent: ""From the above writing, its quite clear that in the presence of the office holders of the Women Welfare Association, respondent had received all her dowry articles and she said that nothing more remained due. Inspite of that she again started harassing the petitioner saying that she had not been given her Mangalsutra. Then on 4.8.1988 she received one Mangalsutra in the office of the ACP, Anti-Dowry Cell from petitioner No.1. But it is not understood why she mentioned in this writing that she had received the same without prejudice to her right to recover the list of her jewellery presented to her by her in-laws at the time of her marriage. The report of the Anti-Dowry Cell (Annexure C at page 19) also indicates that the enquiries conducted by them indicate that there was no evidence of the commission of offences under Sections 498-A/406, IPC. It is rather strange that despite having recovered everything allegedly given in dowry and having executed a receipt in the presence of the once holders of the Women Welfare Association, the respondent is not satisfied and rather she still has harassed the petitioners by filing the present complaint. I am, therefore, of the view that the summoning order by the learned Magistrate on theSharad Dutt vs Kiran on 3 November, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1253515/ 2basis of such a complaint was not called for. Therefore, the complaint and the order passed by learned Magistrate are hereby quashed."" 7. A special leave petition against the aforesaid order was filed by the respondent in the Supreme Court but the same was dismissed on 26.11.1993. A copy of the order of the Supreme Court is Ex. PW 12/2. Review application was also dismissed. Filing of criminal complaint, quashing of the same by this Court, filing of an SLP in the Supreme Court and the same being dismissed and review application also being dismissed has been admitted by respondent in her statement before the Trial Court at pages 128-129. The statement is reproduced as below: ereafter, I filed private complaint before the Magistrate against the petitioner, his mother, aunt and uncle Jagdish Chander u/Sections 498/406, IPC. They were summoned and they furnished bail. They faced the trial for two years. Complaint was quashed by the High Court. I filed SLP in the Supreme Court. That was also dismissed. Review was filed by me but it was dismissed. "" 8. After giving the facts and the brief history of the case, I would now come to the precise disputes for disposal in this appeal. The issues are as follows: (1) Whether the marriage between the parties can sustain because of any custom/usage between the parties? If not, whether the appellant is entitled to annulment of the marriage with the respondent under Section 11 of the Act ? (2) Whether the petition of the appellant before the Trial Court could be rejected on the grounds of laches ? (3) Whether the ppellant, in the alternative, is entitled to get divorce under Section 13 of the Act on the grounds of cruelty allegedly committed by the respondent. 9. After formulating the issues involved, l would now proceed to decide the same one by one. Issue No. 1: Admittedly, the parties are within the degrees of prohibited relationship as the appellant's mother and respondent's father are real sister and brother. The term ""degrees of prohibited relationship"" is defined in Clause (g) of Section 3 of the Act to include children of brother and sister. Section 5 of the Act provides that one of the conditions for the Hindu marriage is that parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. Section 11 of the Act says that any marriage solemnised after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void if it contravenes one of the conditions specified in Clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of Section 5. Clause (iv) of Section 5 says that the parties to a Hindu marriage shall not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. 10. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid legal position and the facts being admitted that the parties are within the degrees of prohibited relationship, the only question to be decided is whether any customSharad Dutt vs Kiran on 3 November, 1997 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1253515/ 3","['6', '3', '13', '5', '11']"

This appeal is by the appellant-defendant, wife of respondent-plaintiff, to challenge the divorce decree dated 21.1.2004 granted by the Trial Court against the appellant- defendant. The Trial Court granted the divorce decree under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. Brief facts of the case are that marriage of the plaintiff- respondent and the defendant-appellant was solemnized on 6.12.1994 at village Loonkaransar in accordance with the Hindu rites. The plaintiff alleged that even at the time of Saptpadi, the defendant-appellant had no control over her body and she was not in position to take Saptpadi. The defendant's sister gave one tablet to the defendant and she told the plaintiff that the defendant is sick. Just after Saptpadi, when photos were taken, the defendant's brother again gave one tablet to the defendant. The marriage was not consummated between the parties despite efforts of the plaintiff on the first night of the marriage or in four days after the marriage. After four days, on 11.12.1994, the appellant's brother took the appellant-defendant to her parent's house. During this short period of four days, whenever the plaintiff-respondent tried to talk with the defendant-appellant, she gave irrelevant answers. The plaintiff-respondent got an impression that the defendant-appellant is not mentally developed lady. From 11.12.1994, the defendant-appellant remained at her parents' house and whenever the plaintiff tried to contract with his wife-appellant, her parents successfully avoided any talks between the appellant and the respondent by saying that she is suffering from some injury or she is sick. During this period of nine months, no efforts were made by the defendant-appellant to come to the plaintiff-respondent's residence. According to the plaintiff, when the plaintiff brought the defendant-appellant at Jodhpur, she avoided to live with the plaintiff and she always insisted for going to her parent's house and gave threat that in case she will not be sent back, she will burn herself and will commit suicide. During this short period also, the plaintiff found that she is talking absolutely irrelevant. The plaintiff shocked when he found that the defendant used to urinate and ease-out, out side the bathroom and latrine. In total three years' period, the defendant lived with the plaintiff only 5 to 6 days but avoided consummation of the marriage. Ultimately, she again left for her parents. 3. On 13.10.2000, the defendant's brother Rajendra brought the defendant-appellant at plaintiff's village and at that time, the defendant started using abusive language in the presence of number of persons and people of entire village came to know that the defendant is suffering from some mental disorder. The plaintiff's grand-father and grand-mother strongly protested to the defendant's brother Rajendra for their giving a mad girl to the plaintiff. The defendant's brother Rajendra, on 14.10.2000, told the family members of the plaintiff that the defendant is suffering from mental disease and she was given treatment at Bikaner. He took the defendant with him and assured that after treatment, he will try to send the defendant to the plaintiff. By this way, the defendant-wife of the plaintiff-respondent remained with the plaintiff for 5 to 6 days only in six years, that too withoutVandana (Smt.) vs Suresh Charan on 24 January, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7195/ 1consummation of the marriage. 4. On these pleadings, the plaintiff-respondent sought decree for divorce under Sub-clause (iii) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. The defendant submitted written statement and denied all the allegations leveled by the plaintiff. In addition to denial of the allegations, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff's maternal aunt was residing at Bikaner and the plaintiff used to come to Bikaner to meet with his maternal aunt. It is also submitted that, at the time of marriage the plaintiff was not in employment and he was preparing for competitive test only therefore, plaintiff and his family members kept the defendant in her parent's home so that plaintiff may prepare for his exams. When plaintiff passed the Rajasthan Administrative Services Examination he started disliking for defendant and wished to marry more beautiful girl and, therefore, he leveled allegations against the defendant. It is also alleged that the plaintiff used to make sarcastic remarks as the defendant did not bring more dowry. 6. The plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for amending the divorce petition so as to include ground to challenge the marriage itself. The plaintiff alleged that marriage of plaintiff and the defendant is void because the defendant was mad before and at the time of marriage and this fact was suppressed by the defendant's parents and by suppressing this material fact, obtained the consent of the plaintiff for marriage. The plaintiff sought declaration that marriage of the plaintiff and defendant may be declared null and void under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the decree was not granted on the said ground because of the fact that the petition for declaration under Section 12 could have been filed within a period of one year from the date of marriage but present petition was filed after about more than six years. Therefore, the divorce petition remained for consideration for grant of decree for divorce under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 7. Issues were framed and plaintiff himself appeared in the witness-box and gave his statement and he was cross-examined by the defendant. The plaintiff in his evidence produced; P.W.2- Karan Singh, his brother, P.W.3-Dalpat Singh, his village neighbour. Plaintiff also produced doctors P.W.4-Dr. L.N. Gupta, P.W.5 Dr. Ashok Kumar Singhal and P.W.6-Dr. K.K. Verma, to prove defendant's unsoundness of mind. To rebut the allegations the defendant produced her father D.W. 1-Laxman Dan and her brother D.W.2-Rajendra Singh in evidence. The defendant did not give her statement nor produced any doctor to prove her mental condition. 8. During trial, the plaintiff submitted an application for medical examination of the defendant by the Medical Board. Initially the defendant tried to avoid but ultimately she presented herself for her medical examination. The Medical Board opined that the appellant is mentally sick as she is suffering from schizophrenia. 9. The Trial Court considered the evidence available on record and the facts of the case and held that the appellant is suffering from mental disorder and the marriage was not consummated between the parties even in long period of more than six years. The defendant as well as her parents have not shown their willingness to send the defendant, wife of the plaintiff to plaintiff-respondent. The TrialVandana (Smt.) vs Suresh Charan on 24 January, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7195/ 2Court also drew adverse inference against the defendant as she did not appear to rebut any allegation. The Trial Court also relied upon the opinion of the Medical Board and after considering the documents relating to the treatment of the defendant, held that the plaintiff is not expected to live with defendant who is suffering from such a mental disorder. 10. The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that the divorce petition of the petitioner should have been dismissed at initial stage itself as there are no sufficient pleadings so as to make out a case for filing the divorce petition against the appellant-defendant. It is submitted that the plaintiff did not plead that the defendant-appellant is suffering from any mental disease which is incurable or the defendant-appellant is suffering from any mental disorder which is of such kind and is of such extent that the plaintiff cannot live with the defendant because of that disorder. It is submitted that in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court delivered in the case of Ram Narain Gupta v. Smt. Rameshwari Gupta (Supra), mere branding of spouse as schizophrenic is not sufficient. It is for the plaintiff to plead and prove the degree of mental disorder of the spouse, also in addition to pleading that the defendant is suffering from mental disorder. Not only this put it is for the plaintiff to further plead and prove that because of defendant's mental condition, the plaintiff cannot live or expected to live with the defendant. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the expression ""incurably unsound mind"" cannot be interpreted so as to cover the feeble- minded persons or persons of dull intellect, as held by the Gujarat High Court in the case of Ajitrai Shivprasad Mehta v. Bai Vasumati (AIR 1969 Guj. 48). Any state of mind which falls short of lunacy or idiocy cannot be allowed to be a ground for annulment of a marriage, as held by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Mt. Titli v. Alfred Robert Jones (AIR 1934 All. 273). According to the learned counsel for the appellant-defendant, the plaintiff-respondent was preparing for his M.A. Examination and, thereafter, he started preparation for competitive test and, therefore, the plaintiff-respondent himself avoided to keep the defendant-appellant with him. He was also preparing for the Rajasthan Administrative Services Examination and whenever the defendant tried to come to the house of the plaintiff-respondent, it was avoided by saying that let the plaintiff build his career. When the plaintiff got the success in the Rajasthan Administrative Service Examination, he immediately filed the divorce petition so that he may have a more beautiful wife with good dowry. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the divorce petition filed by the plaintiff in such situation deserves to be dismissed on the ground of inordinate delay. In support of his argument, the learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court delivered in the case of Jasmel Singh v. Smt. Gurnam Kaur (AIR 1975 P & H 225), where prayer for divorce was refused to the applicant on the ground of filing the divorce petition after inordinate delay. 11. On facts, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the plaintiff-respondent miserably failed to prove that the defendant-appellant is suffering from any mental disorder or she is incurably of unsound mind. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the heavy burden was upon the plaintiff to prove his case. The plaintiff even did not produce the best witnesses and those witnesses were his own mother and father, therefore, the adverse inference is required to be drawn against the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court delivered in the case of Pramatha Kumar Maity v. Ashima Maity (AIR 1991 Cal. 123) and the Division Bench judgment of the Calcutta High Court delivered in the case of Smt.

427,"Punjab-Haryana High Court Sukhdev Singh vs Chhinder Pal Kaur on 28 September, 2000 Equivalent citations: II (2001) DMC 172 Author: R Anand Bench: R Anand JUDGMENT R.L. Anand, J. 1. This is.a Civil Revision and has been directed against the order dated 15.11.1999, passed by the Court of Additional District Judge, Muktsar who allowed the application of rcspondent-Chhinder Pal Kaur under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and granted Rs. 5,000/- by way of litigation charges besides Rs. 1,000/- per month as maintenance pendents lite. 2. Some facts can be noticed in the following manner. Earlier, Smt. Chhinder Pal Kaur filed a petition under Section 11 ofthe Hindu Marriage Act against her hus-band Shri Sukhdev Singh and the said petition was al-lowed on 18.4.1998. In the said petition, it was alleged by Smt. Chhinder Pal Kaur that Shri Sukhdev Singh had spouse living by the name of Naseeb Kaur at the time of her marriage with Sukhdev Singh and, therefore, marriage between the parties was a nullity. The petition was not contested by Sukhdev Singh, as a result of that ex parte decree was passed on 18.4.1998 and it was held by the Court of Additional District Judge, Muktsar that the marriage between the parties was a nullity under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act and necessary declaration was granted and the petition was allowed. Later on Sml. Chhinder Pal Kaur filed the petition under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the Court of Additional District Judge, Muktsar and during the pendency of that petition, she also filed an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and claimed litigation expenses amounting to Rs. 10,000/- besides Rs. 10,000/- per month as maintenance pendente lite. 3. This application was contested by the respondent mainly on the ground that the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is not legally maintainable so much so even the main petition under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not maintainable because the status of the parties as per the own admission of Srnt. Chhinder Pal Kaur, was not that of a valid husband and wife because the decreeunder Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act was passed in favour of Chhinder Pal Kaur. The learned Additional District Judge vide impugned order dated 15.11.1999 allowed the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act by rejecting the contention of the present petitioner and awarded a sum of Rs. 5,000/- by way of litigation expenses and Rs. 1,000/- per month a maintenance pendent e lite. 4. Aggrieved by the order dated 15.11.1999 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, the present revision has been filed. 5. I have heard Shri Ashok Singla, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Shri D.S. Brar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent and with their assistance have gone through the record.Sukhdev Singh vs Chhinder Pal Kaur on 28 September, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1116097/ 16. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner vehemently submitted that since Sml. Chhinder Pal Kaur obtained a decree under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act vide which it was held by the Court that there was never a valid marriage between the spouses because Shri Sukhdev Singh had a spouse living at the time of his marriage with Chhinder Pal Kaur and, therefore, that marriage was a nullity in the eye of law and it will have to be inferred as if the parties were never married in a valid manner. In these circumstances, there was hardly any status of wife upon Smt. Chhinder Pal Kaur, therefore, she had no locus standi to file the petition under Section 25 ofthe Hindu Marriage Act and similarly, she had no locus standi to file the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 7. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon AIR 1988 S.C, 644, Smt. Yamunabai Anantrao Adhav v. Anant Rao Shivram Adhav and another, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, was pleased to observe as follows :- ""Clause (i) of Section 5 lays down, for lawful marriage, the necessary condition that neither party should have a spouse living at the time of the marriage. A marriage in contravention of this condition, therefore, is null and void. The plea that the marriage should not be treated as void because such a marriage was earlier recognised in law and custom cannot be accepted. By reasons of the overriding effect of the Act as mentioned in Section 4, no aid can be taken of the earlier Hindu Law or any custom, or usage as apart of that Law inconsistent with any provision of the Act. Such a marriage cannot also be said to be voidable by reference to Section 12. So far as Section 12 is concerned, it is confined to other categories of marriages and is not applicable to one solemnised in violation of Section 5 Cl. (i). Sub-section (2) of Section 12 puts further restrictions on such a right. The cases covered by this section are not void ab initio, and unless all the conditions mentioned therein are fulfilled and the aggrieved party exercises the right to avoid it, the same continues to be effective. The marriages covered by Section 11 are void ipso jure, that is, void from the very inception, and have to be ignored as not existing in law at all if and when such a question arises. Although the section permits a formal declaration to be made on the presentation of a petition, it is not essential to obtain in advance such a formal declaration from a Court in a proceeding specifically commenced for the purpose. The provisions of Section 16 also throw light on this aspect. Section 16(3) prominently brings out the basic difference in the character of void and voidable marriages as coveied respectively by Sections 11 and 12. It is also to be seen that while the legislature has considered it advisable to uphold the legitimacy of the paternity of a child bom out of a void marriage, it has not extended a similar protection in respect of the mother of the child."" 8. The counsel further supplemented his submission by stating that the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yamunabai's case (supra) were not taken note of by the High Court in the judgment reported as AIR 1999 Punjab and Haryana 229 : 1998(4) RRR 657 (P&H), Devinder Singh v. Jaspal Kaur. The counsel also placed reliance on a judgment of this Court reported as 1990(2) PLR 97, Manjit Singh v. Parson Kaur, Attention of this Court has also been invited to 1993(11) Divorce and Matrimonial Cases 398, Bhaiyalal v. Phoolwati Bai, an authority of Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh High Court. Yet my attention has been invited to AIR 1967 Patna 227, Bansidhar Jha v. Chhabi Chatterjee. Mr. Singla further relied upon 1985(1) HLR 214, Smt. Ramvati Gupta v. State of U.P. and another.Sukhdev Singh vs Chhinder Pal Kaur on 28 September, 2000 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1116097/ 29. On the contrary, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has relied upon judgment of this Court reported as AIR 1999 Punjab and Haryana 229, Devinder Singh v. Jaspal Kaur and submitted that thfs judgment squarely covers the case of the respondent and this judgment has also taken note of the earlier judgments including that of the judgment of the Hon'bte Supreme Court reported as 1993 AIR SCW 2548 : 1994(1) RRR 574 (SC), Smt. Chand Dhawan v. Jawahar Lal Dhawan, 1993(2) Hindu Law Reporter 203. The counsel for the respondent submitted that the judgment of this I ligh Court, namely, Devinder Singh's case (supra) is again based on a judgment of the D.B. of the Bombay High Court reported as 1987(2) Hindu Law Reporter 343 : AIR 1987 Bombay 182. Mr. Brar, learned counsel for the respondent further submits (hat the case which has been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner is mainly under the provisions of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under Section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (old). 10. I have considered the rival contentions of the learned counsel for the parlies and am of the considered opinion that the case law which has been relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner is safely distinguishable. 11. Let us see the basic provisions which have been incorporated in the Hindu Marriage Act in this regard. Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down that ""any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding (he life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conducl of the parties and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable property of the respondent."" 12. While incorporating these provisions in the Act, the Legislature always wanted to secure the interest of female spouse by liberally using the word ""husband"" or ""wife"". Otherwise, the very purpose of providing shelter to a woman will be defeated. The Legislature in its wisdom, if wanted to defeat the rights of a woman who has secured a decree under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, could conveniently say that ""any decree other than the decree obtained under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act"". The moment the proceedings are launched under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, by a husband or by a wife in order to get the maintenance even after the passing of the decree, Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act will come into play as I will presently try to show. 13. Section 24 lays down that where in any proceeding under this Acl, it appears to the Court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it can apply to the Court forgrating relief under this Section. If the contention of Mr. Singla is accepted then it will lead to dangerous consequences. This was never the intention of the Legislature. The Legislature did not want to discriminate the man or woman who files the proceedings under Section 13, 9 or 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act or under Section 11 of the Act. That is the reason the word ""any decree"" has been used in Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. This is the correct interpretation in my opinion.

428,"Madras High Court Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Equivalent citations: I (1992) DMC 347, (1991) IMLJ 290 Author: Ratnam Bench: Ratnam JUDGMENT Ratnam, J. 1. This Civil Revision Petition, at the instance of the wife, is directed against the order of the Court below dismissing the application filed by her in I.A. No. 80 of 1987 in H.M.O.P. No. 171 of 1986, underSection 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, praying that the respondent should be directed to pay the petitioner maintenance in a. sum of Rs. 200/- every month and Rs. 750/- to meet the expenses of that proceeding. 2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the Civil Revision Petition, are as follows:-On 17.9.1977, the respondent herein married the petitioner at Salem and the petitioner gave birth to a daughter. The petitioner and the respondent lived together as wife and husband till 22.8.1984. Misunderstandings appear to have arisen between the parties, which ultimately led to the petitioner being obliged to leave for her parents' house. On 15.7.1985, the petitioner issued a notice to the respondent, setting out the circumstances, under which she was obliged to leave the house of the respondent and demanding payment of maintenance by the respondent and other expenses, to which, on 23.7.1985, the respondent replied, requiring the petitioner to come and live with him. To this, on 29.7 1985, the petitioner sent a rejoinder and subsequently, the petitioner filed M.C. No. 9 of 1985 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, under Section 125, Code of Criminal Procedure, praying for the award of maintenance to her. In that application, the petitioner stated that the respondent was addicted to drinks and had also developed illicit intimacy with another woman and that she was beaten and dirven out of the house by the respondent, justifying her living separately from the respondent and claiming maintenance. That application was resisted by the respondent disputing the grounds alleged by the petitioner. However, on 31.3.1986, in M.C. No. 9 of 1985, the Chief Judicial Magistrate found that the petitioner had established the grounds set out by her in that petition and also found that the petitioner was obliged to leave the respondent for a just cause and that the respondent should pay the petitioner maintenance at the rate of Rs. 250/- per mensem from 31.3.1986 onwards, having regard to the income of the respondent. In Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986, the respondent questioned the correctness of that order, but by order dated 30.1.1990, this Court confirmed the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, in M.C. No. 9 of the 1985 and dismissed Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986. It is not now in dispute and it is also indeed the finding of the Court below in the present proceedings, that the respondent had not paid the maintenance amount to the petitioner, as ordered in M.C. No. 9 of 1985 and confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986. While matters stood thus, the respondent, some time in November, 1986, instituted H.M OP. No. 171 of 1986, Sub Court, Salem under S 13 (1) (1-b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, praying for the passing of a decree for divorce annulling the marriage between the respondent and the petitioner on the ground that the petitioner had voluntarily and wilfully withdrawn from the company of the respondent, without any valid or reasonable cause, for a period of two years from 23.8.1984. That proceeding is being contested by the petitioner on grounds, which need not be noticed for purpose of the present Civil Revision Petition. In I.A. No. 80 of 1987 in H.M.O P, No. 171Vanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883836/ 1of 1986, filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the petitioner prayed for a direction to the respondent to pay her Rs. 200/- every month towards maintenance and Rs. 750/- to meet the expenses of the litigation launched by the respondent. Amongst others, an objection was raised by the respondent that having regard to the prior proceeding under Section 125, Cr. P.C. in M.C. No. 9 of 1985, on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Salem, confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300 of 1986, the petitioner was not entitled to make a claim against the respondent for maintenance and that the petition deserved dismissal, as the petitioner was not entitled to any relief. The learned Subordinate Judge, Salem found that the respondent had not paid to the petitioner the maintenance amount awarded in M.C. No. 9 of 1989, as confirmed by this Court in Crl. R.C. No. 300/86, but that, in view of the decision in Mamta Rani v. RiaJ Kumar, I (1985) IMC 141, the petitioner cannot seek payment of maintenance from the respondent for a second time in view of the prior procedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. However, the Court directed the respondent to pay the petitioner Rs. 300/- towards litigation expenses. It is the correctness of this order in so far as it is against the petitioner that is challenged in this Civil Revision Petition. 3. Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended relying upon the conclusion arrived at by the Court below that the respondent had not paid the maintenance amounts to the petitioner as per the order passed in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. that the view taken by the Court below that the petitioner is not entitled to claim maintenance even in proceedings under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, owing to the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. is erroneous. It was also further pointed out that the decision relied by on by the Court below in Mamta Rani v. Raj Kumar, 1 (1985) IMC 141, did not have any application at all. Attention was also drawn by learned Counsel in this connection to the decisions reported in Surjtt Kaur v, Tirath Singh, AIR 1978 P.&.H. 112, Ramesh Chander v. Veena Kaushal, , Ganapathy v. Rajalakshmi, AIR 1982 T.L.N.J. 426, and Sriramachandra Murthy v. Satya Sathimani, I (1984)-I-MMC 406 (A.P.). On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the petitioner having already succeeded in obtaining an order for payment of maintenance from the respondent in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. cannot be permitted again to recover maintenance under Section 24, Hindu Marriage Act, and strongly relied upon the decisions in Mamta Rani v. Raj Kumar, I (1985) IMC 141, and Sudershan Kumar v. Deepak, 1985 Crl. L J.N.O. C 25 (P&H)-II (1981) DMC 191 (P&H). 4. Whatever previously might have been the right of the wife to claim maintenance as an inicident Of the status of matrimony on the establishment of the relationship of wife and husband, now, under Section 18(1) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, which came into operation on 21.12 1956, a Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of that Act, shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. Section 18(2) of that Act enumerates the circumstances, under which, a Hindu wife is entitled to live separately from her husband, without forfeiting her claim to maintenance. Thus, the right of the wife to claim maintenance from the husband, even in those cases falling under Section 18(2) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, when she is obliged to live separately from her husband, is a statutory one. The method and manner of enforcing this right, would necessarily depend upon the circumstances obtaining in any particular case. It may be that in a given case, the wife may resort to proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. in the hope and with the expectation that she would get quicker and speedier relief in those proceedings. Equally, it may well be that a wife may resort to proceedingsVanaja vs Gopu on 16 November, 1990 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883836/ 2before a Civil Court for the enforcement of such right. Those, however, may at best be characterised as the adoption of different methods for the enforcement of the right to maintenance. It is necessary in this connection to remember that the right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is in the nature of a special right, arising on initiation and during the pendency of the proceedings by one or the other of the parties to the marriage, under the provisions of that Act. Under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the pendency of proceedings under that Act, is an essential condition for the exercise of the right either by the wife or the husband, as the case may be seek an order for payment of the expenses of the proceeding and a monthly sum sufficient for his or her support. It is thus clear that the right to claim maintenance or litigation expeneses under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is not made available generally to the parties to a marriage, but only when a proceeding between the spouses is pending under that Act, and in that respect, the right conferred under Section 24 of that Act, is in the nature of a special statutory right not in any manner outside the provisions Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The purpose behind Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is that parties to a matrimonial cause should not take undue and unfair advantage of a superior financial capacity to defeat the rightful claims of a weaker party and the proceedings under Section 24 of that Act serve a limited purpose, i e. during the pendency of proceedings under that Act, to enable the weaker party to establish rights without being in any manner hindered by lack of financial support. If the special nature of the statutory right under Section 24 of that Act and its purpose, are borne in mind, it is at once clear that the enforcement of that right, cannot in any manner be hedged in by a consideration of proceedings otherwise initiated, either under Section 125, Cr.P.C. or under the ordinary law. Furthermore, in this case, the finding recorded by the Court below is to the effect that the respondent had not paid to the petitioner even the amounts of maintenance awarded in the proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C., and there can, therefore, be absolutely no justification whatever for declining to countenance the claim of the petitioner for maintenance on the ground of the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C, It may also be pointed out that in proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C. the power of the Magistrate is limited to an award of monthly maintenance not exceeding Rs. 500'-in the whole, and under Section 127(2) and (4) Cr.P.C. provision is made for the cancellation or variation of the magisterial order, as a consequence of a decision of a competent civil Court and for the civil Court to take into account the amount paid to recovered by a person, pursuant to an order under Section 125 Cr.P.C. The aforesaid provisions do not in any manner impinge upon the specific statutory right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, upon the parties to a proceeding under the provisions of that Act. It would, therefore, follow that the prior proceedings under Section 125, Cr.P.C, cannot be put against the petitioner, as a ground for declining to entertain her claim, for maintenance in enforcement of her statutory right under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 5. It would be appropriate at this stage to refer to the decisions relied on by learned Counsel for the petitioner. In Surjit Kaur v. Tirath Singh, AIR 1978 P&H 112. Interpreting Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and considering the question whether proceedings under Section 488 of the old Cr.P.C., corresponding to Section 125, Cr.P.C. would have any impact upon the right conferred under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, it was held that a mere pre existing order under the Criminal Procedure Code for payment of maintenance, does not oust the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to allow maintenance Pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In so holding, reference was made to Harbans Lal v. Ganga Devi, 1976 Chand.

Both the suits were tried analogously. The suit for restitution of conjugal rights filed by the husband was decreed and the suit for dissolution of marriage filed by the wife was dismissed. Both the suits were thus disposed of by delivering one judgment on 28.1.94. 5. After expiry of more than one year from the date of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the wife/respondent filed a suit for divorce on the grounds contained in Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act alleging that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights between the parties for a period of more than one year after the passing of the decree under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act on 28.1.94 and therefore the wife/respondent was entitled to a decree of divorce. It was further case of the wife/respondent that after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights the husband/appellant never made any attempt to take back the wife. The wife suffered a fracture in her right leg and was admitted in the S.S.K.M. Hospital, Calcutta and she was under treatment from February 1994 to December 1994. Although this fact of fracture was known to the husband/appellant, he did not care to visit her or to take any information about her illness. According to the wife/respondent the husband/appellant had no honest intention to resume the matrimonial relation after the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. On the contrary appellant's mother and sister instituted a money suit being No. 5/93 in the Court of learned Assistant District Judge, 2nd Court, Howrah against the wife/respondent for malicious prosecution. The husband/appellant also filed a criminal case against the brother of the wife/respondents. All these subsequent events after the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal as also the subsequent conduct of the husband/appellant, clearly suggest that the husband/appellant had never any intention to take back his wife. 6. It is the contention of the present appellant/husband that he had always honest intention to resume the matrimonial relationship and for that he filed the suit for restitution of conjugal rights which was decreed in his favour. After the suit was decreed she made all possible attempts to takePrabhat Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt. Papiya Chakraborty on 14 February, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/851650/ 1his wife back. But the wife/respondent deliberately thwarted all attempts on the part of the husband to resume conjugal life by refusing to come back to her matrimonial home. This, according to the husband/ appellant, was not only a mere non-compliance but also a deliberate act on the part of the wife to frustrate the decree for restitution of conjugal rights. According to the husband/appellant such non-compliance of the decree by the wife/respondent was only for the purpose of making out a case of non-restitution to her advantage also to make out a case under Section 13(1a)(ii) for dissolution of marriage. This, according to the appellant, is a ""wrong"" committed by the wife/respondent within the meaning of Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and the wife should not be allowed to take advantage of her own ""wrong"". 7. In support of his contention the petitioner/appellant relies on a judgment of the Supreme Court [T. Srinivasana v. T. Varalakshmi (Mrs.)]. In the said case the husband obtained a decree for conjugal rights and the wife thereafter wanted to join him. But the husband refused to allow her to enter the house and drove her away. It was held that these acts of the husband were positive ""wrong"" amounting to ""misconduct"" un-condonable for the purpose of Section 23(1a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The husband was rightly denied relief under Section 13(1-A) of the Act. 8. We have gone through the judgment referred to above. In our view the said judgment does not have any manner of application as the facts and circumstances of the present case are quite different from the case referred above. 9. The next judgment relied upon by the appellant is reported in AIR 1995 Orissa 180 (Balabhadra Prodhan v. Sundasimoni Devi). In the said judgment it was held by the learned single judge of Orissa High Court that the provisions of Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act apply to a petition for divorce under Section 13(1A) of the Act. If the wrong is committed by a spouse subsequent to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights and that wrong is serious enough, the same would disentitle him/her to obtain a decree for divorce. It was further held that if the 'wrong' existing prior to the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights continues, the same may in suitable case be considered as an ground for refusing the relief for decree for divorce. In the facts and circumstances of the said case it was held that even if the wife's allegation that the husband committed 'wrong' in not providing her residential accommodation or in not taking her to his place of service at Durgapur, is taken to be true, the same cannot be said so serious as to disentitle the husband to his relief for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce. 10. Next judgment referred to by the appellant is [Geeta Lakshmi v. C.V.R.K. Sarveswara Rao]. In the said case the wife obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. After the decree the husband did not comply with the decree, but did positive acts of ill-treating her and finally drove her away from the house. After 2 years husband filed a petition for divorce alleging that there was no resumption of cohabitation for 2 years. The wife opposed the said petition contending that the husband was taking advantage of his own wrong. It was held that it was not the case of mere noncompliance of a decree, but fresh positive acts of cruelty. It was held that the husband was not entitled to a decree for divorce in view of the commission of wrong as contemplated under Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act.Prabhat Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt. Papiya Chakraborty on 14 February, 2003 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/851650/ 211. In the judgment (Mrs. Sanita Rajendra Nikaljee v. Rajendra Eknath Nikaljee), relied upon by the appellant, it was held that mere disinclination or reluctance to accept the other spouse is not sufficient. There should be attempt of making it impossible for a spouse to resume cohabitation after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights is passed. The discretion is conferred to strike a balance. All this is necessary to be viewed against the back drop of facts and circumstances of each case. 12. Next judgment relied upon by the appellant is (Smt. Guru Bachan Kaur v. Pretam Singh). From a reading of the said judgment it appears that the husband initiated proceeding seven years after alleged desertion. It was the constant plea of the wife/appellant that she was ready to live at Allahabad and she was still ready to resume cohabitation. It was the husband who hesitated to perform his marital duties. In such circumstances it was held by the Division Bench of Allahbad High Court that the husband should not be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong. Appeal preferred by the wife was allowed and the judgment and decree of divorce was set aside. 13. The appellant relying upon the aforesaid judgment argued that after the decree for restitution conjugal rights was passed by a competent Court, he took all possible steps to take back his wife. But all the time she refused to come back to her matrimonial home. Immediately after the expiry of one year from the date of decree for restitution of conjugal rights, she filled a petition for dissolution of marriage. This was a deliberate act on the part of the wife to frustrate the decree for restitution of conjugal rights and this was done by the wife/respondent only to make out a case of non-restitution so that she could file a petition for dissolution of marriage. Accordingly to the appellant/husband this was a ""wrong"" committed by the wife within the meaning of Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and she should not be allowed to take advantage of her own wrong. 14. The next argument advanced by the appellant is that when the earlier suit for divorce filed by the wife was dismissed the second suit was not at all maintainable on the self same cause of action and same is barred by the principle of res judicata. Referring to some portions in the earlier judgment dismissing the suit for divorce filed by the wife, it is submitted by the appellant that the allegation of cruelty, torturer and ill treatment could not be substantiated by the wife by adducing evidence for which the earlier suit for divorce filed by the wife was dismissed. On the other hand suit for restitution of conjugal rights filed by the appellant/husband was decreed in his favour. But the respondent/wife deliberately did not comply with the said decree in spite of honest efforts made by the appellant/husband and after the expiry of one year after the passing of such decree she filed her petition for divorce on the self same cause of action under Section 13(1)(A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 15. It is the contention of the appellant that the second suit is barred by the rules of res judicata. In support of his contention the appellant relies on a judgment of the apex Court (Daryao v. State of Uttar Pradesh). In the said judgment it was held by the Supreme Court that the Rules of res judicata is not merely a technical rule but is based on public policy and the same can be invoked against a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. It was held that if a judgment is pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it is binding upon the parties unless it is reversed or modified by appeal, revision or other procedure prescribed by law. It was further held that it is in the interest of the public at large that finality should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by Courts ofPrabhat Kumar Chakraborty vs Smt.

The parties are husband and wife. Their marital relationship began in January, 1981 and ended in July, 1981 when they separated. During the time that they were together they lived at Girgaum which was their matrimonial home being a family bungalow of ground plus 2 upper floors. It was a joint family property in which they lived with 2 brothers and 2 cousins of husband. They used 2 rooms and a bath on the second floor, and the common kitchen (mess) and hall for visitors. This lis began in 1984 and has left the parties as they were 22 years ago. 2. The wife separated and sued the husband for maintenance. The husband sued her for nullity of their marriage under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground of their relationship being sapinda relationship, in the alternative for divorce on the ground of cruelty, desertion and schizophrenia under Section 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The husband also sued for an injunction restraining the wife from coming into the matrimonial home which was his joint family property. 3. The Additional Principal Judge of the Bombay City Civil and Sessions Court decreed the husband's petition being MJ Petition No. 980 of 1984 on 29th January, 1988. He declared the marriage to be null and void and granted him a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty as well as an injunction restraining her from entering upon the joint family property of the husband. However, he directed him to pay costs of the Petition fixed at Rs. 3000/-. 4. The First Appeal from the said judgment being F.A. No. 1464 of 1988 came to be disposed of by the learned Single Judge by his judgment and order dated 15th March, 1991 setting aside the decree of nullity of marriage as well as the decree of divorce as also the order of injunction and instead granting a decree of judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The order directed the husband to pay the costs of the Appeal fixed at Rs. 5000/- in addition to the costs granted by the trial Court. 5. Both the husband and the wife have been aggrieved by the said order and have filed their separate appeals challenging part of the said order in First Appeal passed by the learned Single Judge. The husband has challenged the judgment setting aside the decree of nullity of his marriage, the decree of divorce as also the order of injunction. The wife has challenged the decree of judicial separation which was not even claimed by her. The above L.P.As. are accordingly filed by both the husband and the wife. 6. It would be apt to first consider the decree of nullity claimed by the husband under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The relationship of the parties is admitted. They come from a common ancestor one Moroba who had one son Laxman and one daughter Champubai. The husband is theArun Laxmanrao Navalkar vs Meena Arun Navalkar on 12 April, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455570/ 1son of Laxman. The wife is the daughter of Champubai's son. Upon this admitted relationship the husband claims that they are sapindas of one another. The wife claims that they are not. The sapinda relationship defined under Section 3(f) and the prohibited relationship under Section 3(a) of Hindu Marriage Act runs thus : 3. Definitions -- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, --""3. (f) (i) ""sapinda relationship"" with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother, and the fifth(inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation; (ii) two persons are said to be ""sapindas"" of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them; 7. In Section 3(f) of the Hindu Marriage Act read with prohibited relationship under Section 3(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act show that the parties must be within 5 generations of lineage from common ancestor through the male ascent. The ascent for both the parties are their respective fathers. Hence, their lineage is therefore male ascent. The wife however, claims that the sapinda relationship is not established as their lineage is intervened by her grand mother who is the husband's parental aunt. However, in the definition of sapinda relationship any breakage of the relationship by such intervening is not contemplated. The parties have a common lineal ascendant (ancestor) Moroba within 5 generations of each of them. The parties are therefore in sapinda relationship. 8. The provisions of Section 5(v) read with Section 3(f) of the Hindu Marriage Act shows that their marriage would be void unless there is a custom in their community to the contrary. 9. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act runs thus : 5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage -- A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:-- (i) neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage; (ii) at the time of the marriage, neither party -- (a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or (b) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or (c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity (iii) the bridegroom has completed the age of (twenty- one years) and the bride, the age of (eighteen years) at the time of the marriage;Arun Laxmanrao Navalkar vs Meena Arun Navalkar on 12 April, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455570/ 2(iv) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; (v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; 10. It will have to be seen whether there is any custom in the community to which the parties belong allowing or enjoining marriage between parties without sapinda relationship and whether there have been (several) such marriages over a period of time which have been performed and are accepted by the community. 11. It is elementary that the onus of proving such a custom would necessarily lie on the party propounding it. What is the burden of proof and how the burden of proof of a given fact is to be discharged under Sections 101, 102 and 103 of the Indian Evidence Act is thus: Section 101 - Burden of proof - Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person. Section 102 - On whom burden of proof lies - The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. Section 103 - Burden of proof as to particular fact - The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person. 12. Consequently in this case it is for the husband to prove sapinda relationship. It is for the wife to prove that there is a custom allowing marriages amongst sapindas in their community. The relationship of the parties being admitted, sapinda relationship need not be proved. The custom to the contrary is required to be proved. 13. The trial Court considered the onus as above. The learned single Judge however, held that it was for the husband to discharge the onus that there was no custom of marriages within sapinda relationship in their community and that since he failed to discharge such a negative onus, his claim to the decree of nullity must fail. It is contended on behalf of the husband by Mr. Patwardhan that no party can discharge a negative onus and hence calling upon the husband to prove lack of custom results in failure of justice. 14. Section 5(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act has indeed not only laid down merely that the marriage of the parties in sapinda relationship is void. It lays down that it would only be void unless there was a custom to the contrary. It is in view of such phraseology that the learned single Judge has held that not only must the party propounding such a relationship to show such relationship but further showArun Laxmanrao Navalkar vs Meena Arun Navalkar on 12 April, 2006 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455570/ 3","['10', '3', '13', '5', '11']"

This revision is directed against the order dated 1st September, 1986 passed by the learned Judge of the City Civil Court, Bombay on Notice of Motion No. 2689 of 1986 arising out of M.J. Petition No. 1078 of 1985 whereby applicant-wife's application for interim maintenance and expenses of the proceedings under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act has been dismissed by the learned judge. 2. The applicant Mrs. Sonia and the opponent Yashpal Khanna were married according to Hindu Vedic rites on 1-8-1984 at Bombay. Soon after the marriage the parties fell out and the opponent-husband Yashpal Khanna on 18th November, 1985 filed a petition for divorce. In those proceedings the applicant-wife took out Notice of Motion No. 2689 of 1986 for interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 4000/- p.m. and costs of the proceedings amounting to Rs 6000/-. Her case was that she had no independent source of income for her maintenance and for meeting the expenses of the proceedings. According to her, the capital account of her husband in the year 1984-85 was about Rs. 2,50,000/- and in the year 1985-86 about Rs. 2,80,000/-. According to her, the income of her husband, as disclosed in his income-tax return for the years 1982-83, 1983-34, 1984-85 and 1985-86 was Rs. 48,000/-, Rs. 48,000/-, Rs. 54,000/- and Rs. 56,000/- respectively. Besides, he had income of interest of Rs. 22,000/- in the year 1984-85 and Rs. 24,000/- in the year 1985-86. Out of the total income of Rs. 50,000/- and Rs. 56,000/- for the said years respectively, she has also submitted that the petitioner opponent also had Rs. 11,000/- in C.D.S., Rs. 16,000/- in P.P.F. and Rs. 8000/- in National Savings Certificates. She submitted that as against this income, the personal withdrawal of her husband during the year 1984-85 was Rs. 7,300/- and in the years 1985-86 it was Rs. 8400/-. Thus the monthly household expenses of her husband during the said period were to the tune of Rs. 600/- to Rs. 700/- p.m. She has further stated that the opponent has his own flat to reside and there was no one in his family defendant on him. According to her, taking into consideration the income of her husband and the paltry amount he required for his maintenance, he could conveniently pay Rs. 4000/- to Rs. 5000/- for her maintenance. She has demanded interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 4000/- and Rs. 6000/- as expenses of the proceedings. 3. The opponent-husband denied that the applicant wife had no independent source of income for her maintenance and for meeting the expenses of the proceedings. According to him, the applicant-wife was a partner in M/s. Kashmirilal & Co. and M/s. R.P. Mehra & Sons and she had yearly income of Rs. 35,000/- from those two firms. She also joined a third firm of M/s. S. Rajesh & Co. started in January 1985. Her yearly Income for the accounting year 1982-83 from that firm was shown at Rs. 34,000/- and for the years 1983-84 and 1984-85 her income has been shown at Rs. 34,000/- per annum from the two firms viz. M/s. Kashmirilal & Co. and M/s. R.P. Mehra & Sons. He submits that apart those sources of income, a large amount of nearly Rs. 2,25,000/- has been lying with the wife as capital income. She has 20% shares in the firm of M/s. Kashmirilal & Co. and 20% shares in M/s. R.P. Mehra & Sons. Thus according to the opponent the applicant has sufficientSonia Wife Of Yashpal Khanna vs Yashpal Kishorilal Khanna on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93569/ 1means of income and as such she was not entitled to the maintenance and the expenses of the proceedings claimed by her. 4. The learned trial Judge after considering the evidence on affidavits adduced by the parties and the documents produced by them, found that the applicant-wife had sufficient means of income for her maintenance and for defraying the expenses of the proceedings and as such she was not entitled to the interim maintenance and the expenses of the proceedings from the opponent-husband. Consistent with these findings, the learned trial Judge dismissed the petition of the applicant-wife. 5. Feeling aggrieved with the order dismissing her petition under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act by the learned Judge of the trial Court, the wife has preferred this revision petition. 6. On the contentions raised and the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the parties, the following points arise for decision in this case :--- (1) Whether this Court in revision under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code cannot interfere with the order of dismissal of application under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act passed by the trial Court ? (2) Whether applicant-wife has no independent income sufficient for her support and for meeting the necessary expenses of proceedings? (3) Whether the applicant-wife is entitled to maintenance at the rate of Rs. 4000/- p.m. and the amount of Rs. 6000/- to meet the expenses of the proceedings ? 7. The learned Counsel for the opponent-husband Mr. Vashi contends that the leaned trial Judge on considering the affidavit evidence and the documents produced before him, found that the applicant-wife has sufficient income to support herself and to meet the expenses of the proceedings and, therefore, dismissed the petition under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act and this Court in revision cannot interfere with the said finding of the learned trial Judge and cannot award maintenance pendente lite and expenses of the proceedings under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In support of his contention he relied on the decision in Haji Suleman Ayub Bhiwandiwala v. Narayan Sadashiv Ogale, 84 Bom.L.R. 122. It is a case under the Bombay Rent Act. Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code was considered in that case and their Lordships of the Supreme Court laid down that section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code applied to jurisdiction alone, the irregular exercise or non-exercise of it or illegal assumption of it and that the section is not directed against the conclusions of law or fact in which the question of jurisdiction is not involved. The expression 'illegally or with material irregularity' in Clause (c) of section 115 means errors relating to material defects or procedure, and not to errors of either law or fact after the formalities which the law prescribed have been complied with. The second decision relied on by him is Ratilal Balabhai Nazar v. Ranchhodbhai Shankarbhai Patil & another, . It was also a case under the Bombay rent Act. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court, while considering the provisions of section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code, held that erroneous construction placed upon a statute by the trial Code does not amount to exercising jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity and would not furnish aSonia Wife Of Yashpal Khanna vs Yashpal Kishorilal Khanna on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93569/ 2ground for interference under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code. The third decision relied on by him is Maitreyee Banerjee v. Prabir Kumar Mukherjee, . In that case the trial Court had allowed amendment of the plaint. The High Court in revision set aside the order of the trial Court. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court, on going through the amendment, prayed for, were unable to agree with the High Court that the appellant by virtue of the amendment sought, had altered the entire nature of the case or substituted a new cause of action. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court held that the High Court in its power of revision ought not to have interfered in a case like that as no jurisdictional error was involved. The fourth decision relied on by the learned Counsel for the opponent-husband is the State of Haryana v. M/s. O.P. Singhal & Co. Hissar, . In that case the learned Single Judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court held that erroneous decision given on question of law cannot be interfered with in revision jurisdiction. It was a case under the Arbitration Act and the question for consideration was whether unsigned arbitration agreement could be relied upon under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. 8. The learned Counsel next relies on the decision in Shri M.L. Sethi v. Shri R.P. Kapur, . In that case the respondent had filed a suit in forma pauperis against the appellant and his wife for recovery of damages to the tune of rupees seven lacs fortyeight thousand for malicious prosecution. Notice of the petition to sue in forma pauperis was given to the State Government and the appellant under Order 33, Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Code. Both the Government and the appellant filed objections stating that the respondent was not pauper. The appellant thereafter filed an application for discovery of documents by the respondent for proving that the respondent was not a pauper. The Court thereafter passed an order on February, 23, 1970, directing the respondent to discover on affidavit the documents relating to the bank accounts of the respondent, namely, pass books, cheque books, counterfoils, etc., from March 1, 1963, to the date of filing of the affidavit of discovery, as also the documents in respect of the properties held by him and the personal accounts maintained by him. The respondent did not file the affidavit in pursuance of the said order by March 8, 1970, though he was ordered to file the affidavit of discovery by that date. On March 31, 1970, he moved an application stating that he wanted to file a revision against the order dated February 23, 1970, before the High Court and that two months' time may be allowed for the purpose. The Court rejected the application for time on April 4, 1970, on the ground that the application for permission to sue in forma pauperis was pending for the last seven years and that the respondent had ample time for filing revision if he was diligent in the matter. The respondent's Counsel then moved another application on the same day stating that the respondent wanted to adduce evidence and since he had not come to the Court in the expectation that his earlier application dated March 31, 1970, for adjournment would be allowed and the hearing might be adjourned. This application was rejected by the Court. As the Counsel for the respondent reported no instructions and as there was no evidence to show that the respondent was a pauper the Court dismissed the application for permission to sue in forma pauperis and directed the respondent to pay the Court fees within 15 days. The respondent challenged the order directing the discovery of documents and also the order dismissing his application for permission to sue in forma pauperis passed on April 4, 1970, in revision before the Allahabad High Court. The High Court held that the trial Court acted with material irregularity as it did not consider the question of necessity for discovery of the documents or the relevancy of the documents of which discovery was sought and also for the reason that in ordering discovery of the documents relating to personal accounts and pass books, it overlooked theSonia Wife Of Yashpal Khanna vs Yashpal Kishorilal Khanna on 25 April, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93569/ 3",['11']

I have heard Sri S.K. Varma, learned counsel for the appellant, and Sri Sankatha Rai, learned counsel for the respondent. 3. The appellant had filed a petition claiming maintenance @ Rs. 1000/- per month: Her case was that she was married to Vijai Narain Singh respondent according to Hindu religious rites in the year 1977 at Village Mainpur, Pargana Karanda District Ghazipur and after the marriage she started living with the respondent in his village Manihara Pargana Barhwal District Varanasi. Later the respondent got employment in the bank and for some time this couple lived at Chandauli District Varanasi. Later the respondent was transferred to Sadath Branch of the Union Bank of India and the two lived together at that place. In due course of time the respondent got some promotions and started getting handsome salary. The respondent, therefore, started neglecting petitioner-wife thinking that she was not sufficiently educated and lacked manners for appropriate social behaviour. He, therefore, stopped keeping the petitioner at the place of his employment and sent her to his village where she lived for some time. Finding herself neglected the petitioner-wife went to her parent's house and started living there. In the absence of the petitioner the respondent wanted to marry some educated girl and the wife therefore, filed suit No. 13 of 1983 to restrain the husband respondent from remarrying. The suit was decreed on 15th September, 1985. In his written statement filed in the aforesaid suit the husband is alleged to have made certain false derogatory statements against the wife causing her mental agony. It was further claimed that the husband-appellant filed suit No. 97 of 198'3 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Varanasi for dissolution of the marriage. Subsequently the husband expressed regrets for his conduct and the said suit No. 97 of 1983 was compromised on 15th April, 1985 and it was agreed that they will live together and the husband would not repeat undignified behaviour. After the aforesaid compromise petitioner again started living with the husband respondent in his village. The husband repeatedly assured the petitioner-wife that he would take her to the place of his employment where he himself resides but fie never did so. It is alleged that occasionally the respondent came to his village but he neglected the petitioner and never had any contact with her as a husband nor provided any means of maintenance. As a result the other members of the family of the husband also started neglecting the petitioner so much so that they would not accept food or water from the petitioner. On one occasion the husband is alleged to have given a beating to the petitioner without any reason at the instance of the family members and started addressing the petitioner as 'chural'. As a result of such behaviour the petitioner-wife claims to have left the husband's village about 1, 1/2 years prior to the petitionSmt. Neelam Singh vs Vijaya Naram Singh on 13 January, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36143/ 1and started living with her parents. Even then the husband did not establish any contact with the wife nor offered to provide any means of maintenance. It was claimed that she has no means of her own to maintain herself and she is living as a dependent of her parents. The respondent is alleged ' to have been employed as Branch Manager in the Union Bank of India at Marookpur District Varanasi and drying a salary of Rs. 4500/- per month. It was further alleged that the husband had agricultural income of about Rs. 1500/- per month from agricultural holding measuring about 25 Bighas. On these allegations the appellant-wife had claimed a decree for separate maintenance @ Rs. 1000 /-per month. 4. The respondent contested the petitioner's claim. The marriage was admitted. It was also admitted that the respondent was employed in the Union Bank of India. The earlier litigation between the parties in suit Nos. 13 of 1983 and 97 of 1983 was also admitted. It was also admitted that after the compromise the petitioner-wife started living with the husband-respondent. 5. It was pleaded that the petitioner's claim was not maintainable in a Court at Ghazipur. According to the husband-respondent the wife was of an irritable nature and did not have regular menstruation and she was always in a tense mood and whenever the husband wanted to have sexual, intercourse with her the wife always avoided on grounds of illness and inability. The husband made all attempts for the treatment of the petitioner but there was no improvement. The condition of the wife got worse day by day and she tried to go to her parent's house very frequently. She started quarrelling with the husband and his family members and indulging in marpit and vulgar abuses. She also accused the husband of having illicit relations with some one else and she used to quarrel and abuse the husband in the presence of his relative and family members. All attempts by the husband to improve the behaviour of the wife bore no fruit. In such circumstances the family members of the wife and the husband decided that any social contact between the husband and the wife be terminated and for this purpose writing dated 27th November, 1980 was written and it was thereafter that the wife filed suit No. 13 of 1983 with wrong allegation. It was on the expression of regrets by the wife and members of her family that the husband compromised the suit. Even thereafter there was no improvement in the behaviour of the petitioner-wife and she went to her parents' house of her own will whenever she liked. With such allegations the husband set up a counter-claim in the aforesaid proceedings claiming that it was not possible for him to live with the petitioner-wife. It was alleged that in January, 1987 the wife had left for her parent's house along with all the valuables. It was claimed that the wife treated the husband with cruelty and it was not possible for him to live with her and the marriage be dissolved by a decree of divorce. The husband claimed that he has to maintain his mother, the widow of his younger brother and her children and a widowed sister who has four children. It was alleged that the amount of maintenance claimed at Rs. 1000/- per month is excessive and the husband-respondent cannot pay that amount. According to him she was not entitled for more than Rs. 300/- per month as maintenance. 6. The wife (appellant) filed a replication denying the allegations made against her and claiming that the counter-claim for dissolution of marriage was not maintainable and was barred by time. 7. On these pleadings, the trial Court framed the following issues:--Smt. Neelam Singh vs Vijaya Naram Singh on 13 January, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36143/ 2(1) Whether petitioner is entitled for separate residence and maintenance, if so its effect? (2) Whether the petitioner has treated the opposite party with cruelty and counter-claim for divorce is maintainable, if so its effect? (3) Relief? 8. On 25th March, 1992 the trial Court directed the parties to appear for reconciliation on 7th April, 1992. On 7th April, 1992 it was noted in the order sheet that the parties are not ready for compromise. Therefore, 20th April, 1992 was fixed for evidence. The hearing was adjourned to 12th May, 1992 when the statement of the petitioner Smt. Neelam Singh commenced. It was completed on 13th May, 1992 on which date when with the examination of PW 2 Surendra Singh the petitioner's evidence was closed. On 14th May, 1992 the statement of PW 1 Vijai Narain Singh was commenced but could not be completed. On 15th May, 1992 the wife-petitioner moved an application praying that an issue be framed regarding the jurisdiction of the Court about the counter claim. The trial Court rejected the same observing that counter-claim for divorce is permissible under the Hindu Marriage Act and the application has been moved to harass the opposite party who is still in the witness box. After the rejection of the aforesaid application, the petitioner-wife moved another application for time to file revision petition against the rejection of the aforesaid application. That too was rejected. Then the petitioner-wife moved an application that she did not expect impartial justice from the Court and there was no time to move the District Judge the same day for transfer of the case and she wanted 20 days time for moving an application and bringing a stay order. This too was rejected. DW 1 was present in the witness box. The counsel for the petitioner-wife declined to cross-examine him. Then another witness was examined. He too was not cross-examined and the counsel for the petitioner withdrew from the case and the Court pronounced the judgment that very day after hearing the counsel for the husband-respondent. 9. In this appeal the first point agitated between the parties was whether the counterclaim set up by the husband-respondent in his reply to the petition for maintenance was maintainable. The proceedings before the Court were of a petition for maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. The trial Court has taken the view that the counter-claim for divorce is maintainable by virtue of Section 23-A of the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 23-A says that in any proceeding for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights, the respon- dent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion, but also make a counter-claim for any relief under this act on that ground; and if the petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion is proved, the Court may give to the respondent any relief under this Act to which he or she would have been entitled if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief on that ground. As is evident, Section 23A provides for a counter-claim only if the proceedings are for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights. The proceedings launched by the wife were not for any such relief but were only for the grant of maintenance. Therefore, on its very face the counter-claim was not permitted by Section 23-A of the Hindu Marriage Act. Sri San-katha Rai, learned counsel for husband-respondent fairly conceded that Section 23-A of the Hindu Marriage Act could not be invoked in the present case 16 sustain theSmt.

433,"Bombay High Court Reeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Author: P Upasani Bench: T C Das, P Upasani JUDGMENT Pratibha Upasani, J. 1. The story revealed in these legal proceedings is the story of a husband, wife and the ""other woman"" in the husband's life, as usual. The unusual angle of this usual story is the legal angle which gives food for thought as to what status this 'other woman' exactly has in a monogamous society, if it turns out that the 'other woman' also is a legally wedded wife, and has the same status? What then happens to the other wife? What if relationship goes soar with both the wives at one time or the other, the couple is divorced and reunited, and the second wife is now isolated and asks for maintenance? All this material is quite spicy and hot enough to churn out a Hindi Masala Movie, displaying sentiments like love, lust, selfishness, materialism and urge for survival. But, Reeta Bharat Arora, Indu Bharat Arora and Bharat Yasodanandan Arora are not the imaginary characters playing roles on the screen in the real life. They are the real persons, in flesh and blood, being singed by harsh circumstances. The wives are the puppets in the hands of destiny. And why blame only destiny? Their husband Bharat also has been selfish all throughout, and has spoiled the lives of these two women; and hold your breath, the Law has added to the woes of the wives. But first, the few admitted facts : 2. On or about 26th January, 1981, Bharat Arora married one Indu Kapoor at Delhi. Indu and her parents were hailing from Indore. Bharat and Indu resided together and cohabited as husband and wife at Bombay. On or about 17th August, 1981, Indu left for Indore. On 25th February, 1982, a son namely, Sunny was born to Indu from the said wedlock. Unfortunately, disputes had already started between Bharat and Indu. Earlier also she had left for her parents place, but there was some sort of compromise between husband and wife. Thereafter, when she went to Indore in the year 1981, prior to Sunny's birth in 1982, she did not come back. Bharat then filed M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984 in the Bombay City Civil Court for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion. In the said petition, Bharat had made several allegations against Indu and had even expressed doubt about paternity of the son. Indu was contesting this matrimonial petition, refuting the allegations, and written statement also was filed by her. Hearing of the matter was adjourned from time to time. During all these years, by and large, Indu used to reside with her parents at Indore. During the pendency of the above referred petition, sometime in the year 1988, Bharat developed illicit relationship with one Reeta Dhawan nee Reeta Sunil Grover. Incidentally, Reeta's divorce proceedings with her husband Sunil Grover also were pending in the City Civil Court till November, 1987 and decree of divorce was granted by City Civil Court in Sunil Grover's favour, dissolving his marriage with Reeta, only on 30th November, 1987. On 28th May, 1989, a daughter by name Shikha was born to Reeta from the illicit relationship with Bharat. The relationship continued, though Reeta very much knew that Bharat was a married person, and his marriage with Indu was subsisting. The stalemate in respect of marriage of Bharat with Indu continued. But on 12th September, 1989, City Civil Court Judge (Ms. R. S. Dalvi) passed ex pane decree of divorce in M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984., after recording evidence of Bharat, in brief, when the matter was in fact appearing on the Board under the caption of ""Framing of Issues"". Neither Indu, nor her Advocate was present at the hearing of this petition on 12thReeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1812333/ 1September, 1989. No issues Were framed, nor was any finding given in respect of the alleged matrimonial offence of desertion and cruelty, but the Judge recorded undertaking of the petitioner Bharat to the effect that ""the petitioner shall not remarry for a period of thirty days from the date of the said decree"". Thus, the undertaking was restricted to a period of only thirty days. On 5th November, 1989, Bharat got married with Reeta in accordance with Hindu Vedic Rites. On 5th November, 1989, declaration that Reeta and Bharat were married was made. The said marriage was thereafter registered on 5th February, 1990. Indu Arora, allegedly, came to know of the ex pane decree passed against her, dissolving her marriage with Bharat on 9th November, 1989. By that time, Family Courts were constituted in Bombay in October, 1989. Indu Arora therefore took out Miscellaneous Application No. 2 of 1990 for setting aside the ex pane decree, in the Family Court, accompanied by application for condonation of delay. On 15th December, 1989, Indu also filed First Appeal No. 336 of 1990 in the High Court of Bombay, challenging the ex pane decree passed against her by City Civil Court Judge, dissolving her marriage with Bharat. In Family Court, in reply to the Application made by Indu Arora, for setting aside the ex pane decree, Bharat did not mention that he had remarried. On 7th August, 1991, Family Court Judge (Mr. S. D. Pandit) passed order in Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 2 of 1990, setting aside the ex pane decree. The said order of the Family Court was challenged by Bharat Arora in the High Court by filing Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991. In the meantime, there was reconciliation between Bharat and Indu. In fact, on 2nd June, 1992, Bharat and Indu applied for withdrawal of the proceedings in the Family Court. On 3rd June, 1992, Reeta filed Civil Application No. 2846 of 1992 in Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 filed by Bharat in High Court for being impleaded as a party-respondent. Reeta also filed M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 in the Family Court at Bandra for a declaration that her marriage with Bharat was legally valid and subsisting. She also moved interim application No. 441 of 1992 and the Family Court passed order, restraining Bharat from throwing Reeta out of the flat at Grand Paradi Apartments, August Kranti Marg, Bombay, where Reeta was staying along with her daughter Shikha. Reeta also got injunction order by way of ad-interim relief restraining Bharat from disposing of the said flat in Grant Paradi Apartments, so also restraining Bharat from entering her bed room, Reeta also moved various applications for interim reliefs in the Family Court, on which, orders came to be passed against Bharat and Bharat challenged all those orders in the High Court by filing various Writ Petitions including Writ Petition No. 2889 of 1993. In Writ Petition No. 2889 of 1993, Bharat had challenged the interlocutory order passed by the Family Court granting maintenance of Rs. 4,000/- per month to Reeta and Rs. 1,500/- per month to daughter Shikha. In addition, the Family Court also ordered Bharat to deposit Rs. 5,000/- towards maintenance of Reeta. Indu also filed M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 in the Family Court at Bandra, inter alia, praying for a declaration that Bharat and Reeta's marriage was not valid. On 22nd September, 1993, Bharat had made application in High Court to withdraw the Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991. Mr. V. P. Tipnis, J. however, declined to pass order permitting Bharat to withdraw the said petition, observing that complex questions of facts and law were involved in the said petition, and therefore, it was to be decided on merits only. On 29th April, 1993, Family Court again passed order being interlocutory order directing Bharat to pay Rs. 5,500/- per month to Reeta and Shikha as maintenance. This order, when challenged by Bharat, in the High Court, was upheld, and in fact, undertaking was filed by Bharat in the High Court for payment of maintenance to Reeta and daughter Shikha.Reeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1812333/ 2Thus, there is no dispute between the parties with respect to the dates, the chronology of events, and the pending litigation between them. 3. This Court (Mr. D. R. Dhanuka, J.) by its common Judgment and Order dated 1st March 1994 disposed of First Appeal No. 336 of 1990 which was filed by Indu, so also, Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 and Writ Petition No, 2289 of 1993 filed by Bharat. The matter was argued at length by the respective Advocates, and this Court, by giving exhaustive reasons, allowed the First Appeal filed by Indu, and the ex pane decree dated 12th September, 1989 was set aside and M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984 filed by Bharat was dismissed as withdrawn. Objection of Reeta for permitting Bharat to withdraw the said M. J. Petition, was rejected. Both the Writ petitions filed by Bharat came to be dismissed by this Court by its common judgment and Order dated 1st March, 1994, and direction was given to the Family Court to dispose of the pending petitions filed by Reeta as well as Indu being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 filed by Reeta and M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 filed by Indu, as expeditiously as possible. While disposing of these Writ Petitions and First Appeal by common Judgment and Order, this Court made certain observations with respect to the conduct of Reeta. The learned Judge observed that the conduct of Reeta in having illicit relationship with a married person like Bharat since the year 1988, was blame-worthy. Reeta also felt aggrieved because the learned Judge confirmed the interlocutory order of the Family Court, and was not happy with the quantum of maintenance. She was also unhappy because the learned Judge allowed Bharat to withdraw his M. J. Petition being M. J. Petition No. 56 of 1984, and the order of allowing the First Appeal filed by Indu and setting aside exparte decree dated 12th September, 1989 passed by the Judge of the City Civil Court, dissolving the marriage between Bharat and Indu. Being aggrieved, Reeta has filed Letters Patent Appeal No. 86 of 1994 (in Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991), so also, Letters Patent Appeal No. 87 of 1994 (in First Appeal No. 336 of 1990). Reeta also has filed Family Court Appeal No. 3 of 2001, since the Family Court did not pass any order on arrears of maintenance payable to her and daughter Shikha, while disposing of finally heard M. J. Petition No, B-52 of 1992. Reeta was also aggrieved, as the Family Court did not express its opinion on validity of marriage of Indu with Bharat. Another ground for filing the Family Court Appeal No. 3 of 2001 by Reeta was that the Family Court Judge did not grant her prayer with respect to security deposit for future maintenance to be paid by Bharat to her. it has to be stated here that as per the directions given by Mr. D. R. Dhanuka, J. while disposing of First Appeal No. 336 of 1990, Writ Petition No. 5884 of 1991 and Writ Petition No. 2289 of 1993, the Family Court Judge recorded the evidence of parties and disposed of both the M. J. Petitions being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992 filed by Reeta and M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992 filed by Indu by his common Judgment dated 31st December, 1999. By giving exhaustive reasoning, the Principal Judge of the Family Court at Bandra dismissed Indu's M. J. Petition No. B-64 of 1992, and allowed Reeta's M. J. Petition being M. J. Petition No. B-52 of 1992. The learned Judge gave a declaration that Reeta's marriage with Bharat was valid. Bharat was restrained by an order of injunction from ousting Reeta from her matrimonial home i.e. 91-A, 9th Floor, Grand Paradi Apartments, August Kranti Marg, Bombay-36.Reeta Bharat Arora vs Bharat Yasodanandan Arora @ ... on 13 June, 2001 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1812333/ 3",['23-A']

Kalindi Ramchandra ... on 30 January, 1991 Equivalent citations: AIR 1991 Bom 315, (1991) 93 BOMLR 567, I (1992) DMC 133 Bench: A Savant JUDGMENT 1. This appeal by the husband, original petitioner, seeks to challenge the judgment and decree dated 29th August, 1986 passed by the City Civil Court, Bombay, dismissing the husband's petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The reliefs prayed for were under S. 27(1)(b) of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 on the ground of desertion and under S. 27(1)(d) on the ground of cruelty. Apart from the question of the relief to be granted to the husband, an important question of law which arises in this appeal is as 10 whether the wife can be granted maintenance while dismissing the husband's petition. In other words whether the order dismissing the husband's petition is a decree within the meaning of the provisions of S. 37 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Another incidental question which arises is whether an application for interim alimony pendente lite can itself be treated as an application for grant of maintenance to the wife under S. 37 of the said Act while dismissing the husband's petition for divorce, The few facts are as under : 2. The husband, Ramchandra, and the wife, Kalindi admittedly belonged to Neo-Buddhist caste which is one of the scheduled castes. They are related to each other before their marriage. On 19th July, 1975 their marriage was solemnised under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. It appears that thereafter on 20th July, 1975 the parties also celebrated the marriage in accordance with the buddhist rites. The husband is working as a Teleprinter operator in the Associated Cement Co., at Churchgate, Bombay. Presently, his salary is above Rs.4,000/- per month. Admittedly, Ramchandra and Kalindi had fallen in love and Kalindi had conceived from Ramchandra before the solemnisation of the marriage. Within four months of the marriage, that is to say, on 9th November, 1975 Kalindi gave birth to son Ravindra alias Ravi. The second son Rajiv alias Raju was born on 16th August, 1978. The petition for divorce has been filed on 9th September, 1982 and briefly stated the averments are as under : 3. According to the husband, within a few months after the marriage the wife started picking up quarrels and insulting and abusing him. It is averred that the wife had deserted him several times, but he brought her back to the matrimonial home. It is further stated that the wife's father Krishnarao Kharat, who was formerly working as a Mechanic in the B.E.S.T. was really not happy with the marriage, which, as stated earlier was a love marriage. He always thought that his daughter deserved a better match. It is further alleged that the wife was carrying on an affair with one Dinkar Salve and had herself expressed a desire to the husband that she wanted a divorce from him so that she could marry Dinkar Salve. In para 6 of the petition, it is alleged that on October 20, 1979 Shantabai Shishupal, sister of the wife's father, came to the matrimonial home and asked the wife to accompany her. On the husband refusing to permit the wife to leave the matrimonial home, it is alleged that Shantabai Shishupal came back in the afternoon of the same day and abused and threatened the husband with assault. Shantabai Shishupal is supposed to have brought some goondas during her 2nd visit on October 20, 1979. But on account of the intervention of some neighbours, no actual assault took place. On 21st October, 1979, however, the wife's father,Ramchandra Anand Suryavanshi vs Smt. Kalindi Ramchandra ... on 30 January, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/296104/ 1Krishnarao Kharat, himself came to the matrimonial home and started abusing the husband and thereafter took his daughter Kalindi away. It is in these facts that the husband had alleged that the wife had deserted him on 21st October, 1979. There is reference to the alleged attempts to try to bring about a reconciliation, which attempts have failed. The husband has thereafter alleged that the wife came to his office at Churchgate, Bombay on 30th November, 1981 and 8th February, 1982 and created a scene there. The husband had lodged N.C. complaints in this behalf, which complaints have been produced on record. In these facts, the husband has alleged that the wife has deserted him and further that the wife has treated him with cruelty within the meaning of the provisions of S. 27(1)(b) and S. 27(1)(d) respectively. 4. The wife has filed her written statement in January, 1983. She has obviously denied most of the allegations. She has admitted that the parties knew each other and that they had fallen in love with each other. She had admitted that she had conceived from Ramchandra even before the marriage and that she had delivered the first child within a period of less than four months of the marriage. She has denied the allegation of alleged quarrels and her misbehaviour. She has also denied the allegation of her having any affair with Dinkar Salve and said that it was an imagination of the fertile brain of the husband. She has denied the several acts of alleged cruelty attributed to her. 5. With reference to the visit of Shantabai Shishupal on 20th October, 1979, the wife has denied that Shantabai Shishupal had asked her to leave the matrimonial home. She also denied that there were any quarrels at the instance of Shantabai Shishupal on 20th October, 1979. The allegation that Shantabai came in the afternoon of 20th October, 1979 with goondas and threatened her husband with dire consequences has been denied by the wife. On the contrary, it has been alleged by her that she was mercilessly beaten by the husband and was left at the residence of her aunt, Shantabai Shishupal. In respect of the visit of her father on the 21st October, 1979, the wife's case is that when her father came to know of her being beaten by the husband, the father came and enquired about Kalindi's health. The further case is that since that was a Divali period -- October, 1979, the husband himself expressed a desire that the father himself should take his daughter with him during Divali. The wife has also alleged that several attempts were made to pursuade the husband to behave himself and to bring about a reconciliation. That, however, did not succeed. The wife has denied the story that she ever demanded a divorce from the husband on any ground whatsoever. The wife has stated that since she was forced to leave the matrimonial home as a result of the husband's harassment and beating and since the husband was not willing to meet her, she had no other alternative but to go to his office with a view to try to bring about reconciliation. The wife admits of her having visited the husband's office, at Churchgate, Bombay, on the 30th November, 1981 as also on the 8th February, 1982, but denies having created any scene there. On the contrary, the wife alleged that the husband took her out of the office, offered her an amount of Rs. 10,000/- for getting a divorce from her and on her refusing to accept the suggestion, slapped her in the face. The wife, therefore, alleges that it was as a result of the conduct of the husband that she was forced to leave the matrimonial home and that she is not guilty of either desertion, as contemplated by S. 27(1)(b) or of cruelty, as contemplated by S. 27(1)(d). The wife, further alleges that she was constrained to initiate proceedings under S. 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, 30th Court, Kurla, where she was awarded Rs. 300/- per month towards maintenance for herself and her two minor children. The application was made on 19th November, 1982 and theRamchandra Anand Suryavanshi vs Smt. Kalindi Ramchandra ... on 30 January, 1991 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/296104/ 2order was passed on 30th March, 1985. It is true that the wife had filed a revision to the Sessions Court for enhanced maintenance which was, however, rejected on 2nd April, 1986. 6. It must be mentioned at this stage that when this appeal was admitted on the 18th February, 1987, the wife made an application, being Civil Application No. 9 of 1989, for an interim alimony at the rate of Rs. 1,200/ - p.m. Upon hearing the counsel for the parties, this Court directed the husband to pay an amount of Rs. 1,000/- p.m. to the wife with effect from 1st May, 1989. Counsel for the parties are agreed before me that this amount is being paid. That, however, was an interim arrangement pending the hearing and final disposal of this appeal. 7. At the trial, the husband examined himself and in support of his case he examined Gangabai Khulkule, who deposed mainly in support of the Dinkar Salve affair and the disputes arising between the spouses as a result of the said affair. The husband also examined Ganpat Bhosale in support of the attempts of reconciliation made by the husband. As far as the wife's evidence is concerned, Kalindi examined herself, her father Krishnarao Kharat, her aunt Shantabai Shishupal and Gangaram Tirpude, who has been examined on the point of attempts to bring about a reconciliation. In the light of the above, the learned trial Judge framed the necessary issues and came to the conclusion that the husband had failed to prove that the respondent had treated him with cruelty. The husband had also failed to prove that the wife had deserted him. On the contrary, it was held by the learned trial Judge that as a result of ill-treatment given by the husband, the wife was compelled to leave the matrimonial home. The learned trial Judge further held that efforts made by the wife and her father to bring about a reconciliation had failed. Though the wife was and is willing to join the husband, it was the husband who was always unwilling to accept her. It was further held that the father (appellant) had shown no interest in the children, their welfare or upbringing and it was mother (respondent) who was, therefore, entitled to their custody. In the result, the learned trial Judge dismissed the husband's petition with costs. 8. In this appeal, I have heard the learned counsel Shri S. S. Lanke for the appellant/ husband and Shri P. Shankaranarayanan for the respondent/wife at length. In accordance with the mandate of S. 34(2) of the Special Marriage Act, an attempt was made to bring about a reconciliation between the parties. In fact the matter was adjourned and also after hearing for some time to enable the parties to come to some amicable settlement. However, both the counsel expressed their liability to bring about a reconciliation and hence, I am left with no alternative but to decide the appeal on merits. 9. Shri Lanke for the appellant has, in the first place, submitted that the act of the wife in leaving the matrimonial home on the 21st October, 1979 constitutes desertion within the meaning of the provisions of S. 27(1)(b) of the Act. He has further contended that the conduct of the wife on the four dates viz. 20th October, 1979, 21st October, 1979, 30th November, 1981 and 8th February, 1982 is such as would amount to treating the husband with cruelty within the meaning of the provisions of S. 27(1)(d) of the said Act. On the other hand, Shri Shankarnarayanan for the wife supported the findings of the learned trial Judge and prayed for the dismissal of the appeal.

Calla, J. 1. This Civil Revision Application under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is directed against the order dated 21st January, 1999 passed by the City Civil Court, Court No. 9, Ahmedabad City, below Application Exh. 45 in Hindu Marriage Petition No. 72 of 1996. 2. The petitioner and the respondent who will be hereinafter referred to as the wife and husband, were married on 6th December, 1994, at Ahmedabad. They resided together at Bombay up to 29th March, 1995. In the end of March, 1995, the wife was sent or came back to Ahmedabad to appear in the examination. The wife's case is that the husband did not take her back to Bombay after the exams were over and the case of the husband is that the wife did not return. The husband then filed a petition for divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act against the wife on 'the ground of non-consumation of marriage and the physical as well as mental cruelty, on 7th February, 1996, in the City Civil Court, at Ahmedabad, which was registered as Hindu Marriage Petition No. 72 of 1996. The wife preferred a petition for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act in the Family Court at Bombay on 11th June, 1996 which was registered as MJA-1103 of 1996. In this application for restitution of conjugal rights, the wife also moved an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act claiming maintenance pendent lite and the expenses to meet the litigation. This application was moved by the wife on 9th August, 1996 before the Family Court, at Bombay and on 25th July, 1997, the Family Court at Bombay passed an-order granting maintenance of Rs. 4,000/- per month to the wife with effect from 9-8-1996, i.e. from the date on which the application under Section 24 had been moved. On behalf of the husband this order dated 25-3-1997 has been sought to be referred as ex parte order, merely because the husband or his counsel did not remain present despite the notice of the wife's application under Section 24 of the Act. Thus, the proceedings between the two spouses were going on against each other with regard to divorce petition as filed by the husband in the Court at Ahmedabad and with regard to the restitution of conjugal rights as moved by the wife in the Family Court, at Bombay. Whereas the order with regard to the maintenance pendente lite had been passed by the Family Court, at Bombay in favour of the wife, she did not move any separate application for maintenance under Section 24 of the Act in the proceedings for divorce as initiated by her husband at the Ahmedabad Court, but she only moved for expenses of the litigation of the divorce petition and the Court at Ahmedabad passed an order for payment of Rs.5,000/- against the expenses of the litigation. According to the husband, the amount of maintenance at the rate of Rs. 4,000/- per month as was granted by the Family Court at Bombay was paid by him up to July, 1998, whereas according to the wife, it is paid only up to June, 1998 and it is also stated that on 25th December, 1998, a sum of Rs. 1,100/-was paid to the wife in addition to the amount paid earlier up to June7July, 1998. The husband's case is that in all, he has paid a sum of Rs. 92,000/ - besides the amount of Rs. 1,100/-, paid on 25th December, 1998. It is also the case of the husband that he is essentially a Chemical Engineer, but on account of some subsequent developments, his income was reduced and, therefore, he moved an application in the Family CourtNeeta Shreyas Joshi vs Shreyas Siddharth Joshi on 23 February, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1141671/ 1at Bombay for reduction of the amount of the maintenance on 17th March, 1998 being Misc. Application No. 395 of 1998 and the same is said to be pending. However, the fact remains that even as per the case of the husband himself, the regular maintenance amount has not been paid after 9th June, 1998. It is submitted on behalf of the husband that the proceedings in the divorce petition at Ahmedabad Court has reached the stage of evidence and so far as the proceedings initiated by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights in the Family Court at Bombay is concerned, it is given out on behalf of the husband that he has already filed the reply to the main application for restitution of conjugal rights and thereafter the proceedings are going on, on his application for reduction of the amount of maintenance and no maintenance is being paid after July, 1998. 3. On 9th December, 1998, the wife, i.e. the present petitioner before this Court moved an application before the City Civil Court No. 9, Ahmedabad, in the petition filed by the husband, praying that the proceedings in this petition be stayed because the husband, i.e. petitioner seeking divorce had not paid the amount of maintenance as was ordered by the Family Court at Bombay. On her behalf, the grievance has been voiced that she had not moved an application under Section 24 in the divorce petition filed by her husband because the maintenance pendente lite had already been granted by the Family Court at Bombay and no payment had been made in pursuance of that order against the maintenance after June, 1998 and that in absence of the payment of regular maintenance after June, 1998, it was not possible for her to meet the expenses to maintain herself. It is also her case that she has also applied for execution of the order of maintenance pendente lite in January, 1999 before the Family Court at Bombay and that application for execution is also pending. However, the wife's application dated 9th December, 1998 moved before the Court at Ahmedabad to stay the proceedings in the divorce petition filed by the husband has been rejected by the Civil Court No. 9, Ahmedabad City, on 21st January, 1999. It is against this order dated 21 st January, 1999, that the present Civil Revision Application under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed before this Court, wherein the husband had already entered a caveat dated 10th February, 1999 and on 12th February, 1999 after hearing both the sides, the Rule was issued and the same was to be heard on 31st March, 1999 as the service had been waived on behalf of the respondent husband. On 12th February, 1999, after hearing both the sides and in presence of both the sides, the following order was passed : ""Rule, to be heard on 31-3-99. Mr. A. R. Lakhia waives service of notice. By way of interim relief it is directed that the trial Court shall decide the application filed by the respondent husband for recalling or modification of the ex parte order granting interim maintenance, before the returnable date. Till then, further proceedings before the said Court shall remain stayed, except the disposal of the application for recalling or setting aside or modification of the ex parte order granting interim maintenance. Direct service is permitted 12-2-99 Sd/- (N. N. Mathur, J.)""Neeta Shreyas Joshi vs Shreyas Siddharth Joshi on 23 February, 1999 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1141671/ 2It appears from the proceedings recorded in this case that on 18th February, 1999 the matter again came up before the Court on a note for Speaking to Minutes and the following order was passed : ""The matter has come up by note for speaking to minutes. The order dated 12-2-99 granting interim relief by directing the trial Court to decide the application filed by the respondent has proceeded on wrong assumption that the said Court is within the jurisdiction of this High Court. It is now realised that the Family Court is in Bombay. In view of this position this Court will not be in a position to give any direction. Accordingly, the interim direction given .by the order dated 12-2-99 is recalled. However, rule which is fixed for hearing on 31-3-99 is preponed and it is fixed for hearing on 22-2-99. S.O. to 22-2-99 18-2-99 Sd/- (N.'N. Mathur, J.)"" Thus, the matter which was to belieard on 31st March, 1999 was directed to be fixed for hearing on 22nd February, 1999, i.e. today. This is how the matter has come up for hearing before this Bench today. 4. I have heard learned Counsel for both the sides and have also gone through the application dated 9th December, 1998 and the impugned order dated 21-1-1999. The learned Counsel for the petitioner wife has submitted that on her application, the proceedings should have been stayed by the Court at Ahmedabad, where the husband's divorce petition is pending because it is not possible for the petitioner to effectively contest the matter in absence of the regular maintenance pendente lite which has not been paid to her since June, 1998 and that it was within the powers and jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmedabad to stay the proceedings pending before itself on the ground that the regular maintenance pendente lite is not being paid as ordered by the Family Court at Bombay and it is a case of the failure of the exercise of the jurisdiction and the inherent powers of the Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that it was a fit case in which such power could be exercised in favour of the present petitioner and that the view taken by the Court while passing the impugned order dated 21st January, 1999 amounts to failure of exercise of the jurisdiction and hence it is a case of denial of the exercise of jurisdiction and the powers which were properly vested in the City Civil Court while dealing with the wife's application for stay of the proceedings in the husband's petition for divorce pending in the Court at Ahmedabad. Mr. A. R. Gupta appearing for the petitioner wife has placed strong reliance on the following decisions : (1) Smt. Malkan Rani v. Krishan Kumar, reported in AIR 1961 Punjab 42; (2) Smt. Anita Karmokar v. Birendra Chandra Karmokar, reported in AIR 1962 Calcutta 88; and (3) Bhuneshwar Prasad v. Dropta Bai, reported in AIR 1963 Madhya Pradesh 259. As against it, it has been submitted on behalf of the respondent husband by Mr. Lakhia that the impugned order dated 21st January, 1999 is unassailable for the simple reason that the Court at Ahmedabad could not stay the proceedings before itself merely because the petitioner-husband had failed to pay the maintenance pendente lite as had been ordered by the Family Court at Bombay. According to him, these are two separate proceedings pending in two different Courts at two different places in two different States.

Nemichand Jain on 7 February, 1994 Equivalent citations: 1996 (1) BomCR 502, II (1994) DMC 25 Author: B Wahane Bench: B Wahane JUDGMENT B.U. Wahane, J. 1. This is unfortunate proceeding pending before me. Before I proceed to decide the matter on merit I would like to dwell for a short while in the Indian culture. Marriage is a social duty towards the family and the community. Marriage is the very foundation of the civil society. It is the duty not only of the couple, but every one in the country to contribute to social metabolism. The marriage, according to the community to which the parties belong, is sacramental and is believed to have been ordained in heaven. The parties to the marriage, therefore, cannot dissolve it at will. They are bound to each other until the death of either of them; and the wife is supposed to be bound to her husband even after his death. This concept of marriage, i.e. it is not dissoluble, is a lofty one because it means that the husband and wife after marriage have to adjust their tastes and temper, their ideals and interests, instead of breaking with each other when they find that these differ. It, thus, involves sacrifices on the part of both husband and wife as each is called upon to overcome the incompatibility of the other. Thereby the spouses are called upon to make the marriage a success by means of compromise and adjustment. The unfortunate young couple, in the instant case, are living separate for the last 5 to 6 years because of the trifling matters. As a duty-bound citizen who always craves for the welfare society, as also duty being imposed under section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and with a view that an indulgence or guidance may save the marriage, before proceeding with hearing, I asked the learned Counsel for the parties to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties. For the reconciliation, the matter was adjourned on some occasions, with no fruitful result. Therefore, the learned Counsel were heard. Even after the hearing, in the interest of the young couple as also the society, I adjourned the matter and directed the litigant couple to remain present in the Court on 27-10-1993 for reconciliation. On 27th October, 1993, the litigant young couple with their fathers, were present in the Court. Firstly, I called the young couple in the chamber and had a talk for about an hour having discussion on the individual, family and social aspects in life and persuaded them to forget their black past as pointed out by them and to re-unite and enjoy the marital bliss. I asked them to return to reunion and to adopt the principle of forget and forgive, before coming to the Court on 4-11-1993. Both parties are educated and capable of understanding the effect of dissolution of marriage upon their child. The importance or striving together for the welfare of their child and his proper custody was explained to the parties. The couple being of the same town, they must see each other, talk freely and frankly and thereby resolve their dispute. Both agreed to do so. Thereafter the fathers of the spouses were individually called in the chamber and they were pursuaded not to put hurdles in their lives, but to see that the couple should enjoy the pleasure of married life. Both expressed that no father will think about the ill of their children. Neither theyS. Rashmi Pradipkumar Jain vs Pradeepkumar S/O. Nemichand Jain on 7 February, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1819437/ 1were in their way, nor they will be in their way in future. The father of Pradeep Kumar Jain, respondent, specifically stated that if the couple wants to live separate from the family, they may live separate in the interest of their welfare or happy life. Neither he nor any member of his family will come in their way. They will extend all co-operation. Ultimately, the case was posted on 4-11-1993. However, inspite of my best pursuation, I was shocked to know that there is no possibility of reunion at all. I, therefore, proceed to decide the case on merits. 2. This second appeal under section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, read with section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, is directed against the decree passed by the Additional District Judge, Amravati, on 30th April, 1991, in Regular Civil Appeal No. 111 of 1990 arising out of the decree passed by the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Achalpur, in Hindu Marriage Petition No. 40 of 1987, dated 25th April, 1990, granting decree of restitution of conjugal rights under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in favour of the husband and directing the appellant/wife S. Rashmi to join the company of her husband and to discharge the matrimonial obligations of the marital life. By the said order, the learned trial Court refused the alternative relief sought under section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage by way of divorce. 3. The marriage of the young couple - Pradeep Kumar and Rashmi - was solemnized on 13-7-1983 as per Jain religious rites and community customs at Paratwada, district Amravati. After the marriage, the spouses lived together happily for a few days. According to the respondent-petitioner, he found his wife of a hot temperament and being the only daughter of her father, she has more affection towards her parents. She was always in habit of visiting her parent's house even without the consent of petitioner-respondent and his parents. The petitioner/respondent was living with his parents and three elderly married brothers. In the month of January, 1986, the appellant Rashmi was taken for religious tour by respondent-petitioner's parents. During her pregnancy, when she was not allowed to go to her parents, she adopted an adament attitude and refused to take meals for two days. In fact, despite the persistence of the petitioner-respondent, the appellant-wife went to her parent's house without the consent of the respondent and other members of the family. The first pregnancy terminated into abortion as there was no chance of survival of the child. At the second occasion, the child was found dead in the womb. On the third time, the appellant delivered a child on 4-11-1986. According to the petitioner-respondent, he had utmost love and affection for his wife. After the appellant delivered the child, neither the appellant nor her parents sent any information about the delivery and birth of son, to the respondent. As soon as the respondent learnt about the delivery, he had visited the house of appellant's parents and enquired about her health and that of newly born child. Much prior to the delivery, the appellant had gone to her parents. On 13-10-1986, the petitioner-respondent met with a serious accident in which he had sustained fracture and other injuries, but neither the appellant nor anybody from her parents' family paid any courtesy visit. On the contrary, when there was a sudden demise of the brother of the appellant-wife at Raipur (Madhya Pradesh), the respondent-husband, though he was having a fracture to his leg, along with his parents, had been to Raipur to pay condolence. According to the respondent-husband, he had made all efforts to bring her back and to lead happy married life, but the appellant-wife refused to join his society. The relatives and responsible members of the community persuaded her to join theS. Rashmi Pradipkumar Jain vs Pradeepkumar S/O. Nemichand Jain on 7 February, 1994 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1819437/ 2society of her husband but attempts proved futile. According to the respondent-husband, the appellant/wife is completely under the thumb of her parents and, therefore, she is not willing to join the company of her husband. On 26-3-1987, a notice was served on the appellant-wife asking her to join the company of the respondent/husband along with all ornaments which she had taken at the time of leaving the matrimonial house. In spite of the notice Exh. 45, the appellant-wife did not turn up. However, she sent a reply notice dated 31-3-1987 levelling false allegations against the petitioner-husband. She stated that she is ready to cohabit with him if he leaves dangerous habits of drinking and beating, on giving assurance of good behaviour within 8 days from the receipt of the notice. If not, he will have to make a provision for maintenance for her and the child. Failing which, she will be constrained to institute legal proceedings for maintenance. Another notice dated 6-4-1987, Exh. 47, was sent to the appellant/wife in which the respondent/husband specified that he is ready to bring her to his residence. He expressed that he will come to her parent's house on 8th April, 1987 or between 8th and 10th April, 1987, and she be ready to accompany with son, ornaments and garments. In pursuance of his notice dated 6-4-1987, he, along with panchas, had been to her parent's house to bring her back. But she declined to accompany him in absence of her father. Consequently, on 11-4-1987, a telegraphic notice was sent, directing her to join his society with son. 4. It is an admitted fact that the financial position of the father of the respondent-husband is more sound than the father of the appellant-wife. Inspite of this, the marriage was solemnized. As the financial condition of the parents of the appellant-wife was and is weak, question of demand of any dowry by the parents of respondent, does not arise. Neither the petitioner nor his parents had demanded or accepted any dowry, is admitted by the father of the appellant-wife in his evidence. 5. The appellant-wife denied the allegations that she was hot tempered and she was in the habit of leaving her matrimonial house without the permission of her husband. She denied that she has deserted her husband without any cause. According to her, she has not either withdrawn or deserted from the society of her husband. According to her, her in-laws and other female folks of the family were insisting her to bring some financial help from her father. Her father had given cheques of Rs. 15,000/-. Even after fulfilling the demands, she was given cruel treatment. According to her, her husband was addicted to vices like drinking liquor and gambling. He used to consume liquor to such extent that he was, many times, required to be lifted by others and brought to house. Because of this, she suffered mental torture. Though for some days, the husband and wife were living separate in mess and residence from the parents of the husband, during that period also she found no change in the behaviour of the husband. She apprehends danger to her life, if she cohabits with her husband. Therefore, she expressed that she is not willing to join the society of her husband. According to the respondent-husband, the appellant-wife had wilfully and without any reasonable cause withdrawn herself from his society and hence he instituted the proceeding under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, for restitution of conjugal rights. Later on, he, by way of amendment, made an alternative claim for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce under sectionS. Rashmi Pradipkumar Jain vs Pradeepkumar S/O.

Rupal Sanjeev Dani on 12 November, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/433671/ 1PRONOUNCED ON : NOVEMBER 12, 2009 JUDGMENT:(Per A.M.Khanwilkar,J) 1. Heard. Admit. 2. Counsel for the Respondent waives service. As short question is involved, Appeal was proceeded for final hearing forthwith at admission stage by consent. 3. This Appeal takes exception to the Judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court dated 10th November, 2008 in Writ Petition No.6485 of 2008 thereby dismissing the Writ Petition preferred by the Appellant and confirming the order passed by the Family Court, Bandra, Mumbai dated 21st June, 2008 below Exh. 5 and 7 in M.J.Petition No.A-218 of 2007. 4. Briefly stated, the Appellant(husband) instituted a Petition for restitution of conjugal rights, being M.J.Petition No.A-1773 of 2004, in the Family Court of Bombay at Bandra against the Respondent(wife) some time on 2nd November, 2004, on the assertion that they had solemnised their marriage on 27th November, 1988 and that two children were born out of the said wedlock, i.e., one daughter and one son now aged about 17 and 7 years respectively. It is stated that the Appellant, on account of his employment with a multinational firm was posted at Delhi as ""Director"" of Pharma Division, in March, 2001. The said posting was the result of natural progression in Appellant's career. However, after the Appellant shifted to Delhi, the Respondent was reluctant to stay with him alongwith two children at Delhi for untenable reasons. As a result, differences arose between them and eventually the Respondent left the matrimonial home alongwith two children and refused to join the Appellant at Delhi. It is in this backdrop Petition for restitution of conjugal rights has been instituted by the Appellant. The Respondent filed her written statement in the said proceedings on 27th September, 2005, contesting the claim of the Appellant. According to the Respondent, it is the Appellant who was responsible for throwing out her from her matrimonial home. As a result of which, she was forced to stay at Mumbai alongwith her two children. It is not necessary to elaborate on the plea taken by both the sides on the merits of the controversy for answering the issue that arises for our consideration in the present proceedings. 5. The Respondent thereafter, filed a Petition before the Family Court of Bombay at Bandra being Petition No.A-218 of 2007 for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion. That Petition was filed on 16th January, 2007. The Appellant therefore, filed application(Exh.5) before the Family Court praying for stay of the subsequent Petition filed by the Respondent, by invoking provisions of Section 10 of the CPC. This Application was filed on 26th April, 2007. In the said Application, the Appellant has stated that the Respondent in response to his Petition for restitution of conjugal rights filed written statement belatedly, after the period of 90 days prescribed by law. In the said written statement however, she has merely opposed the grant of relief of restitution of conjugal rights under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to the Appellant, in the written statement filed by the Respondent, no plea is taken about the alleged cruelty prior to April, 2002 pertaining to time period for which the Respondent had opportunity to plead the same in the Written Statement.B/13 vs Mrs.. Rupal Sanjeev Dani on 12 November, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/433671/ 2Those matters have been referred to in the subsequent Petition filed by the Respondent praying for divorce under section 13(IA) and (IB) of the Hindu Marriage Act. According to the Appellant, the subsequent petition filed by the Respondent is obviously a counter blast to the Petition filed by the Appellant for relief of restitution of conjugal rights. It is then stated in the said application (Exh.5) that having regard to the plea taken in both the proceedings and with regard to the reliefs claimed in the said Petitions, in order to avoid conflicting decisions, in the interest of justice, it is appropriate that subsequent Petition filed by the Respondent after more than two years from the date of institution of the Petition by the Appellant, be stayed. The Appellant has also asserted that the parties to both the Petitions are the same. The issues involved in both the Petitions are directly and substantially the same and having regard to Section 10 of the CPC, the subsequent Petition filed by the Respondent should be stayed. The Appellant has further asserted that he is confident that he has a fair chance of getting decree for restitution of conjugal rights, which would allow a period of one year for the parties for re-approachment, which has more weight than the relief claimed by the Respondent as it would facilitate the objectives of the Family Courts Act to sustain the institution of marriage. Therefore, if the subsequent Petition of the Respondent is not stayed, the parties would miss that golden opportunity. Moreover, entertaining subsequent Petition filed by the Respondent would result in giving opportunity to the Respondent to file further written statement. For all these reasons, it was prayed that the Petition filed by the Respondent herein being M.J.Petition No.A-218 of 2007 should be stayed. 6. The Respondent opposed the said application and also filed application for clubbing of the two Petitions, which application was treated as Exh.7. That application was filed by the Respondent on 29 th September, 2007. In this application, it is stated that in both the Petitions the parties will be leading common evidence. As a result, to save the precious time of the Court, it is essential that both the petitions are clubbed together. The Respondent has further asserted that in the event the Petitions are not clubbed, the Court will have to perform double exercise of conducting two trials of the Petitions seperately where the entire evidence and document will be the common. On this assertion, the Respondent prayed that both the Petitions filed by the Appellant as well as the Respondent respectively being Petition No.A-218/2007 and A-1773/2004 be clubbed and proceeded together. 7. The Family Court disposed of both the Applications preferred by the Appellant as well as the Respondent, Exh.5 and Exh.7 respectively, together by common Judgment and Order dated 19th June, 2008. The Family Court opined that pleadings or defence in respect of the two Petitions are same, though the parties are seeking completely different reliefs. It further held that the Petition for restitution of conjugal rights was pending for almost last four years. Therefore, to avoid further delay and multiplicity of trial, it would be just and proper to decide both the Petitions together even by recording common evidence in both the Petitions.

Now, the instant original application has been filed by the first respondent in the Election Petition No.6/2004 seeking rejecting of the said election petition under Order VII Rule 11(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 3. The case of the petitioner is as follows: (a) The election petition is not maintainable in law. The pleadings in the election petition do not project any cause of action and do not contain any material facts constituting any cause of action and a triable issue. Under the circumstances, the election petition is, therefore, liable to be rejected in limini under Order VII Rule 11(a) C.P.C. (b) The entire averments in the election petition project only one fact that the petitioner herein had disclosed in Annexure-I of Form No.2A made under Rule 4 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, relating to nomination papers, that he has two spouses and, the said fact taken along with Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Sec.494 of the I.P.C., would disqualify him from contesting in the election and as such there has been improper acceptance of his nomination to contest for the South Madras Parliamentary Constituency. (c) The judgment of the Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Association of Democratic Rules ((2002) 5 SCC 294), relied on by the election petitioner, does not apply to the present facts of the case, and it is totally misquoted. The law laid down by the Supreme Court in the said judgment, is that the Election Commission should require in the exercise of its powers under Article 32 4 of the Constitution of India, each candidate to submit as a necessary part of his nomination papers, information on an affidavit in respect of items specified by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court further held that the limitation on plenary character of power is when Parliament or State Legislature has made a valid law relating to or in connection with the elections, the Commission is required to act in conformity with the said provisions. In case where the law is silent, Article 324 is a reservoir of power to act for the avowed purpose having free and fair elections. To put in other words, the Election Commission under Article 324 can only supplement and not supplant the Leg islation occupying a particular field. Sec.100 of the Representation of People Act sets out variousT.R.Baalu : vs S.Purushothaman on 29 August, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/209099/ 2grounds for declaring an election to be void, and nobody has the powers to add any further grounds in Sec.100. The election petitioner has filed the above said Election Petition to declare the election of the petitioner herein as void on the grounds within the meaning of Sec.80 read with 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of People Act. From the provisions of law under which the election petitioner seeks to have the petitioner's election set aside, i t is clear that there should be a non-compliance of either the provisions of the Constitution or of the Representation of People Act or of any rules or orders made under this Act. As regards any orders made under this Act, the Election Commission of India has not been vested with any powers to make any orders under the provisions of the Representation of People Act. It was, therefore, the Supreme Court held in the decision stated supra, that in the absence of any parliamentary legislation occupying a particular field, the Election Commission can issue orders and directions under Article 324 of the Constitution. (d) In this case, the petitioner had given necessary information as required of him by declaring that he has two spouses living. Therefore, he had complied with the order made by the Election Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution. He had not violated any provisions of the Constitution. Non-compliance with the order made under Article 324 of the Constitution has to be distinguished from noncompliance of any provisions of the Constitution. The Parliament while indicating in Sec.100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act, regarding non-compliance of the provisions of the Constitution did not go further and stipulate orders made under the Constitution also as it had stipulated in respect of ""this Act"" (meaning of Representation of People Act) or of any Rules or Orders made under this Act. If Sec.100(1)(d)(iv) has to be read as including non-compliance with the orders made under the provisions of the Constitution, then it will tantamount to redrafting Sec.1 00(1)(d)(iv) by adding the words ""Orders made under provisions of Constitution"" for which nobody has the power excepting the Parliament. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the said decision, the whole object of orders being made under Article 324 of the Constitution in fields which are not occupied by Parliamentary Legislation, that is the conduct of elections, is to get information to be filed as Annexure to the nomination forms, which are merely information regarding a candidate so as to enable the voters to judge for themselves as to whether a candidate should be elected or not. If the particulars that have got to be filled up by a candidate in the nomination paper are not filled up, then perhaps the Returning Officer could reject the nomination paper itself. If particulars have been filled up and the facts disclosed in filling up such particulars have not led to any conviction for any offence, which alone might become relevant under Sec.8 of the Representation of People Act, there is no question of any disqualification of a person from contesting the election, which would arise. (e) The thrust of the case of the election petitioner is that the disclosure of two wives by the petitioner herein in the Annexure to the nomination papers and as such Sec.17 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Sec.494 of the I.P.C. would disqualify him. This averment has been made by the election petitioner without any regard to either the ingredients of Sec.17 of the Hindu Marriage Act or the ingredients of Sec.494 of the I.P.C. read with Sec.198 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the meaning of expression used in Sec.494 of the I.P.C. namely ""such marriage being void"" must mean only marriages validly made. If the marriage is not a valid marriage, then it is no marriage at all in the eye of law. The bare fact of a man and a woman living as husband and wife, does not at any rate normally give them the status of husband and wife. As per Sec.17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, unless the marriage is celebrated or performed with properT.R.Baalu : vs S.Purushothaman on 29 August, 2005 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/209099/ 3",['17']

The point which requires determination in these two appeals, arising from a common judgment and order dated February 15, 1991 of a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh, in Civil Revisions Nos. 2918 and 2919 of 1990 is, whether the payment of alimony is admissible without the relationship between the spouses being terminated, 2. The wife-appellant was married to the husband-respondent on September 19, 1972 at Amritsar, in the State of Punjab. Three children were born from the wedlock and are at present living with their father. Out of them two are males, their respective years of birth being 1973 and 1980 and the third is a female born in the year 1976. On August 28, 1985 a petition under Section 13-B of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereafter referred to as 'the Act') seeking divorce by mutual consent was received by the Court of the Additional District Judge, Amritsar purported to have been filed jointly by the two spouses. It was stated therein that the parties had been living separately for over a year due to incompatibility of temperament and their effort to settle their differences amongst themselves, or with the aid of friends and relatives, had been futile. On receipt the petition was kept pending, as was the requirement of Section 13-B of the Act. According to the wife she was not a consenting party to the filing of such petition at all. Her version was that the husband had duped her in obtaining her signatures on blank papers on a false pretext and in turn had employed those papers in the said petition for divorce. On coming to know of the pendency of the petition, she immediately filed objections before the Court, obstructing the grant of petition. The respective pleas of the parties were put to issue and evidence was led. According to the wife some understanding later was reached between the parties on the basis of which she was to be put back in the matrimonial home and thus the petition was got dismissed on August 19, 1987 on the basis of the joint statement of the parties before the Additional District Judge, Amritsar which was to the following effect : We agree that applications under sections 24 and 25 of Hindu Marriage Act may be dismissed. We also agree that since the parties have not been able to make a joint statement within a period of six months of the original petition, the main petition under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act may be dismissed. Otherwise too, the parties to the marriage do not want to proceed with their main application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and the same be also dismissed and the parties may be left to bear their own costs. On the basis of the above statement, the Court passed the following order the same day : The applicant and counsel for the parties have made their statements recorded separately, the main petition under Section 13 and also applications under sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are dismissed as withdrawn. The parties are left to bear their own costs. The file be consigned.Chand Dhawan vs Jawaharlal Dhawan on 11 June, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/942025/ 13. It appears that the dismissal of the petition under Section 13-B led only to a temporary truce, and not peace as hoped. Rehabilitation in the matrimonial home evaded the wife. The husband, who in the meantime had established his business at Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, barely three months after the dismissal of the petition under Section 13-B, approached the District Court at Ghaziabad in a regular petition for divorce under Section 13 of the Act levelling, amongst others, allegations of adultery against the wife. To meet the offensive the wife refuted the charge of adultery and prayed to the Ghaziabad Court grant of maintenance pendente lite, which the Court fixed at Rs. 1000 per month. It appears since the husband had obstacled payment of maintenance pendente lite, divorce proceedings stand stayed under orders of the High Court of Allahabad, until the order of grant of maintenance pendente lite was obeyed. The matter thus stands stagnated there. 4. The wife then went in an offensive. She moved the Court of Additional District Judge, Amritsar on March 22, 1990, under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act for the grant of permanent alimony on the plea that she was facing starvation, when her husband was a multi-millionaire, having cars, telephone facilities and other amenities of life. Simultaneously she moved the Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act for maintenance pendente lite and litigation expenses. After a grim contest between the parties the Additional District Judge, Amritsar on September 20, 1990 allowed the petition, under Section 24 of the Act granting her a sum of Rs. 6000 as litigation expenses and Rs. 2000 per month as maintenance pendente lite, from the date of application. The husband challenged the said order of grant in revision before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The wife too approached the High Court in revision seeking enhancement of sums under both counts. Both the revision petitions being referred to a Larger Bench were disposed of by the common judgment under appeal sustaining the objection of the husband that an application under Section 25 of the Act was, in the facts and circumstances, not maintainable; the Matrimonial Court at Amritsar, in the earlier litigation, having not passed any decree of the variables known as restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, nullity of marriage, or divorce, so as to quash proceedings under Section 25 and sequelly quashing the order under Section 24 of the Act granting litigation expenses and maintenance pendente lite. Hence these appeals. 5. Section 25 of the Act, as it now stands, after amendment by Act 68 of 1976, is reproduced hereunder : 25. Permanent Alimony and Maintenance. - (1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto* on application made to it for purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case, it may seem to the Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable, property of the respondent. (2) If the Court is satisfied that there is, a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has made an order under Sub-section (1), it may at the instance of either party, vary, modifyChand Dhawan vs Jawaharlal Dhawan on 11 June, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/942025/ 2or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just. (3) If the Court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been made under this section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she has not remained chaste, or, if such party is the husband, that he has had sexual intercourse with any woman outside wedlock, it may at the instance of the other party vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the Court may deem just. It Is relevant to reproduce Section 28 as well :, 28. Appeal from Decrees and Orders. - (1) All decrees made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (2) Orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act, under Section 25 or Section 26 shall, subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be appealable if they are not interim orders and every such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. (3) There shall be no appeal under this section on the subject of costs only. (4) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the decree or order. 6. Right from its inception, at the unamended stage, the words ""at the time of passing any decree or any time subsequent thereto"" posed difficulty. The majority of the High Courts in the country took the view that those words indicated that an order for permanent alimony or maintenance in favour of the wife or the husband could only be made when a decree is passed granting any substantive relief and not where the main petition itself is dismissed or withdrawn. It was also gathered that if no request for alimony was made at the time of passing the decree the same relief could be sought subsequently on an application. The relief of permanent alimony was deduced to be ancillary or incidental to the substantive relief and it was given to the party to whom such relief was due. The expression 'any decree' was viewed to have been used having regard to the various kinds of decrees such as decree for restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, nullity of marriage, and divorce, which could be passed either on contest or consent. Some of the High Courts also had occasion to distinguish between the expressions ""passing any decree"" referred to in Section 25(1) with ""decrees made"" referred to in Section 28 providing for appeals from decrees and orders made by the Court in any proceeding under the Act, and such decrees being appealable, as decrees of the Court made in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. It led to the determination of the question whether the denial of relief under the Act, when making a decree in the sense appealable under Section 28, could be it a decree passed within the meaning of Section 25 entitling the respective spouses to claim permanent alimony thereunder. On this question too there has been rife, a difference of opinion,Chand Dhawan vs Jawaharlal Dhawan on 11 June, 1993 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/942025/ 3","['26', '13', '24', '28', '25', '13-B']"

Dharmadhikari, J. Page 1198 1. This appeal and another appeal No. 558 of 2004 between same parties were to be heard and decided together. Accordingly, today I have completed hearing in both the appeals and by separate order, because of limited nature of controversy involved therein, second appeal No. 558 of 2004 has been disposed of. Though in that appeal, it has been held that Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act protected deceased Sakharam who has executed Will of his joint undivided family property, still the Will has not been accepted to be legal and valid, and therefore, judgment and decree of lower appellate Court has been maintained. 2. This second appeal is filed by original plaintiffs in regular civil suit No. 61 of 1996. Suit filed by them was for declaration, partition and separate possession. Trial Court decreed the suit partly and the original defendants Page 1199 then filed regular civil appeal No. 101 of 2001 on 20/8/2004. First Ad hoc Additional District Judge, Bhandara has partly allowed that appeal. Thereafter this second appeal has been admitted on 14/3/2006 by formulating following question as substantial question of law: (1) Whether unmarried illegitimate daughters on the date of coming into force of Maharashtra Amendment Act, 1994 [which has came into force from 22/6/1994], have an equal share as that of a male coparcener by virtue of Section 29-A [Maharashtra Amendment Act] read with Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act? 3. For the purposes of understanding facts, family tree which is not in dispute needs to be given here: BULUCHA NATTHA | KANHU | _____________________________________ | | Tukaram Sakharam (died on 25/1/95) | ___________________________ | | Rukhma @ Raiwanti Gayabai (defdt. 2) wife (Pltff.) - wife | _________________________________ | | Gopal (son) Mukhklabai defdt.1 defdt.3 _____________________________________________________ | | | | | Ruplata Madapika Vijutai Bharti Sushma daughter daughter daughter daughter daughter Pltff.

The property came to Sakharam from his father Kanhu and after partition between brother Tukaram and Sakharam. Sakharam died on 25/01/1995. On 14/3/1996 Gayabai and her children filed regular civil suit No. 61 of 1996 and claimed their share in agricultural lands and also house property. There is no dispute in this second appeal about the said property or its description. Gayabai and plaintiffs had claimed half share in the suit properties. Gayabai contended that as defendant No. 2 Rukhmabai could not conceive from Sakharam, Sakharam married with her in the year 1961 and then the daughters as mentioned above were born to her. She stated that during life time of Sakharam, they were residing with him and after his death, defendants obstructed cultivation of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also received notice from Talathi through which they learnt about Will deed dated 23/2/1993 executed in favour of defendant No. 1-Gopal. Page 1200 She challenged said Will as fabricated document and claimed partition. The trial Court framed five issues and held that Gayabai and other plaintiffs have share in suit property and were entitled to partition and separate possession of their share. It also directed preparation of preliminary decree and sent precept to the Collector for partition in agricultural land. It directed appointment of Commissioner for partition of house property. The trial Court then gave 9/32 share to plaintiff Nos. 2, 3 & defendant No. 1each. It gave 1/32 share in suit property to defendant Nos. 2, 3 and plaintiff Nos. 4, 5 and 6. 5. The defendants then filed regular civil appeal No. 101 of 2001 and appellate Court found that marriage of Gayabai with Sakharam in the year 1961 was proved and it further found that plaintiff Nos. 2 to 6 were born to Gayabai from Sakharam and they were entitled to partition and separate possession of their respective shares. However, it dismissed claim of plaintiff No. 1 Gayabai. It declared that plaintiff Nos. 2 to 6 i.e. children of Gayabai from Sakharam were entitled to 1/24 share each and defendant No. 3 was also entitled to get 1/24 share. While, defendant No. 1 Gopal and his mother Rukhamabai-defendant No. 2 were entitled to have 9/24 share each. It accordingly directed precept to be sent to the Collector and appointed Commissioner for partition of house property. It also directed enquiry under Order XX Rule 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure for mesne profit. Thereafter, the second appeal has been filed which has been admitted on question as mentioned above. 6. The substantial question of law as formulated above clearly shows that the entitlement of unmarried illegitimate daughters to equal share as that of male coparcener needs to be looked into in the light of provisions of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act and Section 29-A added by Maharashtra Amendment Act, 1994 to Hindu Succession Act which has come into force from 22/6/1994. Present provisions of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act which came into force from 25/7/1996. 7. I have heard Advocate R. L. Khapre with Shri P. B. Patil for appellants-plaintiffs and Advocate Shri N.S. Bhattad for both the respondents. 8. After inviting attention to the fact as mentioned above, Advocate Khapre has argued that marriage of Gayabai with defendant Sakharam in 1961 as per Budha religion is not in dispute. He also invites attention to evidence of Gayabai in this respect and points out that there was no crossSmt. Gayabai Wd/O Sakharam ... vs Gopal Sakharam Jambhulkar And ... on 13 February, 2008 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/627403/ 2examination about the religion or caste of original defendants. He also invites attention to certain documents like Exh. 65 and Exh. 57. He further states that Headmaster who has issued certificate at Exh. 57 was examined and there is no cross examination by defendants to show that caste as recorded was incorrect. He, therefore, contends that parties are Shudras and hence, their case is to be considered in the light of relevant provisions as applicable to them. 9. In this background he invited attention to a judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported at (Gur Narain Das and Anr. v. Gur Tahal Das and Ors.) to show that before 1956 i.e. before coming into force of Hindu Succession Act, a Shudra illegitimate son was entitled to half Page 1201 share than a normal coparceners and he could also enforce partition if his father was separate. He contends that this position is protected by Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act because succession as provided therein is applicable only after the separate share of a coparceners in joint family is worked out. He, therefore, argues that on death of Sakharam in 1995, there has to be a notional partition and separate share of Sakharam could thereafter devolve as per provisions of Hindu Succession Act. He has also cited certain rulings to support that upon death of such person holding share in joint family property, there has to be a notional partition. However, as there is no debate between the parties in this respect, I do not find it necessary to make reference to these judgments. 10. With this he invites attention to the provisions of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act to state that distinction between legitimate issue and illegitimate issue has been done away after 25/7/1976. He, therefore, states that illegitimate Shudra son needs to be treated as legitimate son and similarly illegitimate Shudra daughter needs to be treated as legitimate daughter. He thereafter invites attention to provisions of Section 29 of Hindu Succession Act to state that as plaintiff Nos. 2 and 3 were unmarried on the date of which said modification came into force, they attained status of coparceners. He argues that because of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act, they loose their character as illegitimate daughters and became legitimate daughters and hence as Section 29 of Hindu Succession Act treats daughters as coparceners and it gives them share equal to a son, Plaintiff Nos. 2 and 3 also became coparceners and entitled to a share which in law is given to a son. He contends that the Courts below have not considered total effect of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act as also the effect of Section 29 of Hindu Succession Act. 11. He pointed out a judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court reported at (2006) 9 SCC 612 (Neelamma and Ors. v. Sarojamma and Ors.), (Jinia Keotin and Ors. v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi and Ors.) and (Shataram Tukaram Patil and Anr. v. Smt. Dagubai Tukaram Patil and Ors.) to indicate how the provisions of Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act are considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court or by the Division Bench of this Court. He, however, states that judgments do not disclose whether parties considered in those judgments were belonging to Shudra class or upper class. He, therefore, states that those judgments only show the scope of provisions of Section 16 in the absence of a right as available to Shudra illegitimate son under uncodified Hindu law. He also invites attention to judgment of Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court reported at (Rasala Surya Prakasarao and Ors. v. Rasala Venkateshwararao and Ors.) wherein the Hon'ble High Court has after considering provisions of Section 16 held that illegitimate sons of Hindu are Page 1202 entitled to equal share with natural son, and therefore, can be treated as coparceners.

I have stated the dates of filing of petitions and counter-affidavits since they have some relevance when I deal with the matter regarding the merits of the case. 4. In the petition filed by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights, it is averred that the marriage took place on 7.9.1986 at Swamimalai. At that time, the respondent (husband) was employed at Tirunelveli and the petitioner (wife) was employed in Canara Bank, Trichy Junction Branch. It is stated that they lived as husband and wife at 21, Keela Kosa Street, Beema Nagar, Trichy from 1986 onwards. The respondent was transferred to Thanjavur in October, 1987 after which they got settled down at Thanjavur. The petitioner was transferred to Thanjavur in January, 1989 and till then she was attending to her duty at Trichy by going from Thanjavur. During 1989-90, both of them lived at No. 2, Anna Nagar, Easwari Nagar, Thanjavur Town. It is said that right from the beginning, except at the initial stage, the husband had started to cast a doubtful eye upon the petitioner (wife), and also treated her with utmost cruelty and beat her black and blue. The wife says that she was patiently waiting that one day or other the husband would change his attitude and lead a normal life with her. But it was of no use. Under some pretext or other or on some flimsy grounds, the husband had started beating the wife without any justification at all. It is stated by the wife that he even avoided having any sexual relationship with her and was always insulting. her using undesirable and unpalatable words. It is stated that the respondent deserted the petitioner on 10.6.1990 taking away with him all the articles offered at the time of marriage. The wife was left alone in the house. She made several bona fide and earnest attempts to effect a mediation, but due to the stubborn attitude of the husband, nothing could be done. As a result of this, she had no other alternative except to live with her parents at Kumbakonam from August, 1990. Even thereafter several mediations were attempted. But the attitude of the respondent (husband) was not encouraging. It is said that after marriage, she alone was maintaining the family spending more than Rs. 5,000/-. According to the wife, right from September, 1986 till May, 1990, she has handed over her entire salary, bonus and arrears, totaling about Rs. 80,000/- to the respondent (husband). All these amounts were givenLakshmi Shanmugham vs P.R. Shanmugham on 13 September, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/376677/ 1with the fond hope that both of them would settle down peacefully. But, inspite of the same, the conduct of the respondent was cruel. It is said that in view of the conduct of the respondent, she has undergone untold mental and physical torture. A demand was made to the respondent to cohabit with her and lead a happy marital life. A reply was sent by the husband in which false allegations have been made. The statement made therein that the wife left the matrimonial home is incorrect. The statements made in the reply notice are false to the knowledge of the respondent. In the reply, the husband wanted the petitioner-wife's consent for her divorce, for which she is not willing. She is still hopeful of leading a normal life. Since the respondent has refused to lead a normal marital life and has deserted her, she has sought for restitution of conjugal rights. 5. In the counter filed by the respondent to the petition, the date of marriage is admitted. It is also admitted that he was employed at Tirunelveli and he used to visit Trichy once in a fortnight and stay with his wife during every weekend and he was transferred to Thanjavur in October, 1987, after which both the petitioner and the respondent settled down at Thanjavur. But the petitioner (wife) was transferred to Thanjavur only in January, 1989. Till then she was attending to her duty at Trichy by going from Thanjavur. It is said that right from the beginning, the petitioner did not exhibit any genuine anxiety to run the matrimonial home as a dutiful Hindu wife and she proved herself to be an overbearing type of woman given to hysterical outbursts. According to the husband, the wife was always quarrelsome and not a single day passed without her picking up some quarrel or other on trivial and flimsy things. It is stated that the respondent's continuous approach to the petitioner (wife) to put her in proper lines and to make her develop a taste for a peaceful and harmonious marital life was only in vain and she had obviously no desire to run the matrimonial home in a normal and peaceful manner. According to the husband, the wife used to go to Kumbakonam to her parents' house frequently under some pretext or other not bothering about her husband's comforts and well-being and she sometimes did not even return home after finishing her office work, and because of this, the respondent had to undergo terrible mental agony without any peace of mind and his efficiency in his official career was also affected as a result of the mental agony. The respondent (husband) tried to change the attitude of the petitioner (wife) through his well-wishers. The allegation that the husband avoided having sexual relationship with the wife, is denied. On the other hand, the wife only avoided the husband even from the first day itself. The respondent says that the averment that he used to beat the wife without any justification is false. It is stated that in December, 1989, the wife left the family house without any reason whatsoever and she was attending to her official work at Thanjavur by coming from her parents' house at Kumbakonam. When the respondent met the petitioner at her office and expressed his displeasure and wanted her to come and live with him, she ridiculed the idea and gave out that she was not prepared for any such event. But she came to the house of the respondent only once between December, 1989 and March, 1990, for the purpose of threatening and intimidating, and the letter sent by her in October, 1990 also reveals her character. It is said the respondent went on official tour in or about January or February 1990, handing over the key of the house to the owner, with a request that in the event of his wife coming there, the key might be given to her. Sometime letter, the petitioner had come there alongwith her parents and occupied the house. When the husband returned from tour, she did not open the door, and making hysterical outbursts she cried out that she was not prepared to live with him and showered volley of abuses on the respondent from upstairs, creating an ugly scene in the locality. Hence the respondent was forced to stay in his friend's house that night consequent uponLakshmi Shanmugham vs P.R. Shanmugham on 13 September, 1995 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/376677/ 2the indecent behaviour of his wife. It is said that the wife herself wrote a letter addressing her name, with an intention to stop the marriage. In fact, the marriage was arranged by the respondent only after seeing a ""Wanted"" column in 'The Hindu' dated 1.6.1986. After sometime, on 15.7.1987, she had undergone a training in her office at Madras Staff Training College. On receipt of some records after filing of the O.P., he got an order sent from the Circle Office to the petitioner to undergo the training. From that order, he found that she had undergone the Special Training for Scheduled Tribes in the Bank. After verification, the respondent came to know that her father, brother, herself and her sister got job only claiming as Scheduled Tribes. It is stated that the wife's parents belonged to Gavara Naidu and the documents reveal the original community of the petitioner and her parents. It is stated that the wife has cheated the Government and has seized the opportunity which is intended to benefit a Scheduled Tribe. According to the respondent, this one incident is sufficient to prove the mentality of the wife. 6. It is further averred by the husband that there are several instances which will speak volumes of her indecent behaviour. The respondent bore such humiliations and insults only with the genuine hope of turn of events for better. It is said that the wife had shown disrespect to her husband. While the husband was working at Tirunelveli, and the wife was at Trichy, she was in the family way. The husband took her to a doctor for check up and it was found that she was pregnant an her pregnancy was two months old. When he came from Tirunelveli subsequently, he was shocked to find that his wife had effected voluntry miscarriage. When the husband questioned her as to how she could do it without his consent, she had the temerity to retort that effecting miscarriage was her own business and she was not bound to get the respondent's consent. It is said that this one incident will be ample proof of the petitioner's overbearing nature and also her adamant attitude. It is said that the respondent could refer so many incidents which he reserves for the time of enquiry. From December, 1989 to March 1990, there were several incidents which completely betrayed the imperious and overbearing attitude petitioner. The petitioner would never tolerate her conduct being questioned by the respondent. At times she even grew violent and threw costly articles including a transistor in a fit of wild rage. The respondent says that he was brought up in such atmosphere that he would deal with the domestic issues smoothly. On the other hand, the wife was always found lacking in patience, tolerance and amicable settlement of any domestic dispute. It is stated that from March, 1990, the respondent was never allowed to enter the house at No. 2, Anna Nagar, Thanjavur. She abused him, and in fact, went to the extent of asking him to fix up some other house for himself. The matter was tried to be compromised through mediation. At a mediation, in the presence of certain well- wishers, the petitioner expressed that she was not prepared to live with the husband and that she would take away all her belongings including the jewels, and then, in fact, within a few days of the mediation, she had removed all her belongings including 18 sovereigns of jewels presented to her by the respondent's parents and left Thanjavur to settle down at Kumbakonam with her parents. Hence the respondent was forced to fix up a separate house for himself in No. 24, Sri Nagar 1st Street, Thanjavur. It is stated by the husband that only the wife, by her own conduct and callous mental attitude, rendered herself to be unsuitable for any peaceful marital life, and that the petitioner (wife) is clearly guilty of infliction of mental cruelty and also desertion of the respondent without any justifiable or reasonable cause. It is also stated that the wife herself at several times expressed that she was not willing to lead a matrimonial life with the respondent. It is said that the wife, without realising the consquences, has indulged in baseless andLakshmi Shanmugham vs P.R.

442,"Andhra High Court B. Chandra Manikyamma vs B. Sudarsana Rao Alias Saleem ... on 9 September, 1988 Bench: G R Rao JUDGMENT 1. A-1 is the husband and P.W. 1 is the wife. They belong to Kamma community. P.W. 1 filed a complaint against A-1 to A-8 for offences under S. 494 and 494 read with S. 109 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. A-3 and A-4 are the parents and A-5 is the brother of A-1. A-6 is the brother-in-law of A-7. A-7 and A-8 are the parents of A-2. 3. The Judicial I Class Magistrate, Avanigadda, framed a charge against A-1 and A-2 for the offence under S. 494 of the Indian Penal Code and against A-3 to A-8 for the offence under S. 494 read with S. 109 of the Indian Penal Code. 4. On behalf of the complainant (PW 1) seven witnesses were examined and Exs. P-1 and P-2 were marked. On behalf of the accused, DWs. 1 and 2 were examined. The accused denied the allegations made against them. 5. The learned Magistrate, on appreciation of the evidence, found the accused guilty and convicted A-1 and A-2 for the offence under S. 494 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them each to undergo R.I. for one year and also to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- in default to undergo S.I. for one year. A-3 to A-8 were convicted for the offence under S. 494 read with S. 109, IPC and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 500/- each in default to undergo S.I. for six months. 6. Against the convictions and the sentences passed by the Magistrate, the accused preferred Crl. Appeal No. 74/86. The Addl. Sessions Judge, Krishna at Machilipatnam, set aside the convictions and the sentences awarded by the Magistrate. The complainant now filed the present appeal. 7. The case of the complainant is as follows : A-1 married PW 1 on 21-4-1977 according to Hindu rites at Tirupathi. The marriage was consummated. P.W. 1 gave birth to a male child two years after the marriage and the child died after three months. Two years thereafter during the wedlock with A-1, P.W. 1 gave birth to a female child by name Siva Ravali. 8. P.W. 1's father died during her childhood. On 21-4-1983, A-1 and A-3 heat P.W. 1 and drove her away from the house. After she was driven away from the house, she went to her mother's house. A-1 did not take her back. 9. At the time of marriage, two acres of wet land, forty sovereigns of gold and furniture and cooking vessels were presented to P.W. 1. The income from the landed property was enjoyed by her husband A-1 and her father-in-law A-3. Her husband and the father-in-law used to pledge the gold to getB. Chandra Manikyamma vs B. Sudarsana Rao Alias Saleem ... on 9 September, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/299022/ 1loans whenever money was required for agricultural purposes and they did not render accounts of income on her property. 10. On 4-7-1983, A-1 married A-2 by name Attaluri Lakshmi, daughter of A-7 and A-8 at Teluguraopalem, Krishna District, at about 7.30 a.m. in the house of A-7 according to Hindu rites. P.Ws. 2 to 4, 6 and some others witnessed the second marriage. 11. P.W. 1 came to know about the second marriage through PW 2 on 4-9-1983. On coming to know that P.W. 1 may take any action, A-1 and A-2 converted into Islam and again they married in the house of Mirja Mohishin Ali, Moulvi of Alinekkipalem, hamlet of Shoragundi, according to Muslim rites on 21-2-1984 in the presence of P.Ws. 5 and 7. A-3 to A-8 abetted and arranged the marriage between A-1 and A-2, knowing fully well about the subsistence of the first marriage of A-1 with P.W. 1. 12. A-1 and A-2 are residing with the parents of A-1 and they are observing Hindu formalities and they are not observing Muslim faith. A-1 is not attending the Masjid for Namaj, particularly on Fridays and they are called by their Hindu names in the village. A-1 and A-2 are worshipping Hindu deities and performing Hindu festivals. A-2 is wearing a Mangalasuthram, Metlu and Tilakam. 13. P.W. 1 issued a registered notice through her lawyer. A-1 and A-2 styling themselves as Saleem Mohammed and Laila Banu, sent a reply notice Ex. P-2. In Ex. P-2, the factum of conversion of A-1 and A-2 into Islam and the second marriage under the Muslim rites has been admitted. A-1 admitted in Ex. P-2 that P.W. 1 is his wife and the marriage took place not on 21-4-1976, but on 21-4-1977 at Tirupathi. 14. The Magistrate found that the marriage between A-1 and A-2 was performed on 4-7-1983 at Teluguraopalem in the house of A-7 and A-8. The marriage between A-1 and A-2 in the house of P.W. 7 under Muslim rites on 21-2-1984 also has been proved. The marriage between A-1 and P.W. 1 was subsisting as on the date of the second marriage either under the Hindu or under the Muslim Law. A-3 to A-8 abetted and facilitated the second marriage between A-1 and A-2 and the Magistrate has accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. 15. On appeal, the learned Addl. Sessions Judge found that there is no evidence to show that there is a legal marriage between P.W. 1 and A-1. A-1 has converted himself as a Mohammedan and he can have four wives at a time and it is not an offence under the Muslim Law. He also found that the marriage between A-1 and A-2 was performed on 21-2-984 as alleged. It is the first marriage between A-1 and A-2 under the Muslim Law and it is not a void marriage and no offence has been made out under S. 494 of the Indian Penal Code. 16. Sri Bali Reddy, learned counsel for the appellant contended that the marriage between the appellant and the 1st respondent (A-1) was not disputed by the 1st respondent. There was not even a suggestion made to P.W. 1 when she was in the witness box questioning the said marriage and both the parties proceeded under the impression that P.W. 1 and A-1 are the wife and husband and the finding of the lower appellate court is not correct. It is further contended that the marriage betweenB. Chandra Manikyamma vs B. Sudarsana Rao Alias Saleem ... on 9 September, 1988 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/299022/ 2A-1 and A-2 was performed on 4-7-1983 in accordance with the custom as evidenced by P.Ws. 2 to 4, 6 and others and the well considered finding of the Magistrate ought not to have been set aside by the lower appellate court. It is next contended that the statement made by A-1 that he married A-2 according to Muslim Law would go to show that he was anxious to get over the criminal proceedings under S. 494 of the Indian Penal Code. 17. Sri Padmanabha Reddy, learned counsel for respondents-accused contended that under Law, the first and the second marriages must be proved by the complainant and the findings of the lower appellate court, basing on the rulings referred to therein are correct and the findings do not warrant any interference by this Court. 18. In a case of reversing judgment, it is the duty of the court to consider whether the reasoning given by the lower appellate court in particular is correct, or not. If the reasoning is not correct and if it is not based on appreciation of correct facts and legal position, then this court can certainly interfere with the findings of the lower appellate court. 19. A-1 and P.W. 1 are Hindus by the date of their marriage i.e. 21-4-1977. The marriage under the Hindu Law is the voluntary union of one man with one woman to the exclusion of all others satisfied by the soleminzation of the marriage. 20. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act lays down the conditions to be fulfilled in a marriage between any two Hindus. One of the conditions is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. Section of the Act says that (1) a Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto; and (2) where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi (that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken. Section 11 of the Act deals with void marriages. One of the conditions, if contravened, which makes a marriage solemnized after the commencement of the Act null and void, is, if any party thereto has a spouse living at the time of the marriage. S. 17 of the Act reiterating the position and providing for punishment of bigamy, runs thus : ""Any marriage between two Hindus solemnized after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living; and the provisions of Sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly."" Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code deals with the offence of bigamy reads as under :- ""Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine."" The essential ingredients of the offence are-(i) that the accused had already married some person; (ii) that the accused married another person; (iii) that the husband or wife to whom the person wasB.

Chakraborty, learned Counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr. B. Debnath, learned Counsel for the opposite-party. At the request of the learned Counsel for the petitioner, in the facts and circumstances this petition is being disposed of at the admission stage itself. 2. The present Civil Revision Petition has been preferred under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the order dated 24-1-2007 passed by the learned Judge, Family Court, Agartala, West Tripura in T.S. (Divorce) No. 228 of 2008 indicating that a title suit for divorce was to be presented in the form of the plaint and since the relief claimed through such petition is declaratory in nature, therefore, the court-fee of Rs. 20/- has to be paid under the Court Fees Act, 1870 (for short 'Court Fees Act'). 3. The petitioner presented a petition, i.e. T.S. (Divorce) No. 228 of 2006, before learned Family Court on 18-5-2006 under Section 13(1)(1a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (in short called Hindu Marriage 'Act') for dissolution of marriage between the parties by way of decree of divorce. While presenting the petition for divorce court-fee of an amount of Re. 1/- was affixed by the petitioner but the Sheristradar of the Family Court reported deficit of court-fee of Rupees 19/- on the petition presented by the petitioner. 4. Shri R. Chakraborty, learned advocate appointed as amicus curiae by learned Family Court assisted learned Family Court. Learned Family Court vide impugned order dated 24-1-2007 has observed that the legislature has used the word 'petition' in Section 13 of the 'Act' which is essentially a plaint. For obtaining a declaratory decree without consequential relief, court-fees of Rs. 20/- has to be paid on the petition and T.S. (Divorce) No. 228 of 2006 under Schedule II, Article 17(III) of the Tripura Court Fees Act. According to learned Family Court, a petition for divorce being plaint in nature and relief claimed in such petition being declaratory in nature shall have to be presented affixing court-fees of Rs. 20/- and as such the petitioner was directed to supply additional court-fee of Rs. 19/- within 31st January, 2007 and for that purpose the process was issued upon the opposite-party. 5. Being aggrieved, the petitioner has approached this Court preferring the present revision petition under Article 227 of the Constitution with a prayer to invoke the power of superintendence to cure the jurisdictional illegality and impropriety of the impugned order. 6. Learned Family Court in its impugned order has analyzed the aspects involved in the case as below:Smt. Baby Deb vs Ajit Deb on 12 October, 2007 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154000/ 1According to Mitra's Legal and Commercial Dictionary, 5th Edition, a petition is a formal written request made to a Judge or superior, a document embodying such a formal written request any petition and application mean the same thing AIR 1957 Mysore 44. And plaint is a document of plaintiff on which proceedings in a Court of law commences. In the Hindu Marriage Act the legislature has used the word petition in Section 13. In Section 24 of the said Act, the word application has been used. Section 24 is supplementary to Section 13 and other sections for obtaining substantive relief. According to the Section 19 of the Act, a petition under this Act shall have to be presented to the District Court within the local limits whose ordinary civil jurisdiction, the marriage was solemnized etc. So, in the light of the Section 19, application for obtaining a decree under Section 13 cannot be said to be an application as formal written request made to a Judge. Moreso, on an application under Section 13 making of a decree is mandatory as the application has to be decided formally on merit. As per CPC a decree means the formal expression of an adjudication, which conclusively determines the rights of parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit. Rather, an application under Section 24 of the Act is an application containing formal request to a Judge for giving some sort of relief during pendency of the suit. Because the intent and purpose of Section 24 is to offer reasonable opportunity to the applicant for taking active part in the adjudication of the petition which is preferred for obtaining substantive relief in the form of decree. In a petition/application for obtaining a decree of divorce, Judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, divorce on mutual consent, the petitioner has to file the petition showing: A) The name of the Court in which it is brought. B) Name, description and residence of the petitioner. C) Name, description and residence of the opposite party. D) Whether the petitioner or opposite party is a minor or of unsound mind, a statement of that fact. E) The facts constituting the cause of action. F) The facts showing that the Court has jurisdiction. And also the relief claimed. And basically, these are the ingredients of a plaint which has to be covered in an application or petition. 7. The Trial Court below interpreted the terms 'Petition' on the basis of dictionary meaning holding that a petition is a formal written request, made to a Judge or a Superior, a document embodying such a formal request petition and application mean the same thing. 8.

The facts in outline :- 2.The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnized on 06.11.2000 as per the Hindu Rites and customs. In the said wed lock a female child was born to the parties in the year 2001. The marriage life was cordial during the inception. However, crack developed in their married life on account of an alleged intimacy between the respondent and one Papathi. Though the petitioner suffered everything for a better tomorrow, the respondent was indifferent. Ultimately, the petitioner was constrained to leave the matrimonial home along with her daughter. 3.The petitioner filed an application for maintenance before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Erode. The said maintenance petition filed under section 125 Cr.P.C. was registered as M.C.No.63/2006. The application was allowed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate as per order dated 29.07.2008 and the respondent was directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,000/- every month to the petitioner and a sum of Rs.500/- to her daughter as maintenance.Amutha @ Symaladevi : vs K.Thirumoorthy @ Thirumalaisamy ... on 25 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1746603/ 14.While the matters stood thus, petitioner filed a petition for divorce under section 13(1)(1A)(1B) of the Hindu Marriage Act [for short, 'the Act'] before the Principal Subordinate Judge, Erode. The said application was taken on file as H.M.O.P.No.234/ 2006. 5.The petitioner also filed an application in I.A.No.92/2008 under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying for interim maintenance during the pendency of the matrimonial proceedings. 6.The said application was contested by the respondent by filing counter. Respondent mainly resisted the claim on the ground that the divorce petition itself could be taken up for early hearing and as such, it was not necessary to consider the interlocutory application in the meantime. The Judgment of the Judge :- 7.The learned Subordinate Judge rejected the application on the ground that the petitioner was awarded maintenance by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in M.C.No.63/2006 and as such, the application invoking Section 24 of the Act was clearly not maintainable. 8.The legality and correctness of the said order is the subject matter in the civil revision petition. Discussion :- 9.The cause of action for filing a petition under section 24 of the Act would arise only when there is a matrimonial proceeding initiated by the husband or wife. Therefore, the primary requirement for claiming maintenance under section 24 of the Act is the pendency of a matrimonial proceeding. This provision was introduced with a laudable object of ensuring maintenance to a party to the proceeding so as to enable him or her to maintain during the pendency of such proceedings. This provision also permits the Court to award reasonable amount for the purpose of conducting the matrimonial proceeding. Concept of maintenance :- 10.The term ""maintenance"" has not been defined in the Act. Therefore, the definition given to the term ""maintenance"" in the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 assumes significance. Section 3(b) of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 gives an inclusive definition to the term ""maintenance"". As per the said definition, maintenance includes in all cases, provisions for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment and in the case of an unmarried daughter, reasonable expenditure incidental to her marriage. 11.The concept of maintenance as per Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, pre-supposes that the party has no independent income sufficient for his or her support. Therefore, the primary requirement for granting maintenance under section 24 of the Act is the absence of any income for the applicant to maintain himself or herself during the pendency of the proceeding. While deciding an application under section 24 of the Act, the Judge was expected to consider the entire factual matrix, which includes the inability of the party to maintain herself or himself during the pendencyAmutha @ Symaladevi : vs K.Thirumoorthy @ Thirumalaisamy ... on 25 August, 2009 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1746603/ 2of the proceeding as well as the income of the opposite party and to arrive at the amount of maintenance which should be just and reasonable. Therefore, this provision is a measure of social justice. 12.The remedy provided under section 125 of the Cr.P.C. is totally for a different purpose. This remedy does not oust the jurisdiction of the Family Court to award maintenance under section 24 of the Act. The scope of the proceeding under section 125 Cr.P.C. is very limited. It is purely a summary proceeding. Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. permits the Court to vary the order. Therefore, Section 125 Cr.P.C. operates in an entirely different sphere. 13.There is no ceiling prescribed for the purpose of granting maintenance under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Section 24 of the Act seeks to maintain an equilibrium between the two parties to the litigation during the pendency of the proceeding as it makes provision for payment of maintenance for a party who was in a disadvantageous position to maintain and to contest the proceeding on account of poor economic condition. 14.The parties to the proceeding should be in a position to maintain the standard of living consistent with their status. Living does not mean luxurious living. The intention of the parliament was to strike a balance so as to enable the parties to contest the matter effectively. In short, in case of matrimonial proceeding initiated by the husband, the wife should be in a reasonable financial condition to maintain herself during the pendency of the proceeding. In case she was not having the financial resources to maintain herself, naturally, she would be denied of an opportunity to contest the proceeding. 15.The amount awarded under section 125 Cr.P.C. is not static. It could be modified on an application by a party to the proceeding. In case there was a pre-existing order to pay maintenance under section 125 Cr.P.C., the said order could be taken note of by the matrimonial Court in a proceeding under section 24 of the Act. However, currency of such order would not stand in the way of the Court in granting maintenance under section 24 of the Act. 16.Therefore, the Family Court, in an application under section 24 of the Act, was entitled to consider the order passed by the Magistrate under section 125 Cr.P.C. for the purpose of arriving at the interim maintenance. The maintenance under section 24 of the Act is interim in nature, which would be in operation till the disposal of the matrimonial proceedings. Therefore, the maintenance proceedings initiated under section 125 Cr.P.C. cannot be dismissed on the ground of a pre-existing order under section 24 of the Act. In all such cases, the respective Courts had to exercise the discretion in accordance with the legal principles and the quantum has to be fixed after taking into account the prior proceedings initiated by the parties for the purpose of maintenance. In any case, the proceeding under section 24 of the Act cannot be dismissed on the ground of currency of an order under section 125 Cr.P.C.

Payal Agrawal                                 Versus                             Deepak Garg Hon'ble V.K.Shukla,J      Present writ petition has been filed by the petitioner for quashing of the orders dated 25.05.2009 and 14.10.2009 passed by Additional District Judge, Mathura, Annexure-7 & 14 to the writ petition respectively, wherein application moved by petitioner contending therein that proceedings under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act 1955 are not maintainable, has been rejected and further prayer for examining the minor child has been rejected.      Brief background of the case is that marriage of sole petitioner with sole respondent was solemnised as per Hindu Rites and Customs on 20.11.2003 and one daughter was born of said wedlock on 21.08.2004. It appears that there was matrimonial discord on account of which petitioner started living with her father. Deepak Garg, husband of petitioner filed petition under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act for passing the decree of restitution of conjugal right against the petitioner in the court of Civil Judge (S.D) Mathura on 22.04.2008 which was registered as Matrimonial Petition No. 144 of 2008. Petitioner submits that thereafter on account of intervention of relatives and respectable persons the joint petition for dissolution of marriage under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed which was registered as Marriage Petition No. 193 of 2008( Smt. Payal Garg Vs. Deepak Garg) in the court of Additional District Judge, court no. 9 Mathura on 28.05.2008. In the said case parties to the dispute have filed their respective affidavit on 28.05.2008 in support of their joint petition under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act. Said joint petition was allowed and marriage in question was dissolved vide judgment and decree dated 12.12.2008. Husband Deepak Garg on 02.01.2009 moved an application terming the same to be under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act for issuing direction to petitioner to permit him and his parents to meet periodically Km. Tulsi and to offer gifts as and when required. During the pendency of the aforesaid application two other applications were filed supported with affidavits for furnishing therein the details of investment of Rs. five lacs given to minor Tulsi and furnish details of education and health of minor Tulsi. Petitioner objected to to by filing application dated 08.05.2009 by contending therein that application under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act was not maintainable and it was motivated application. To the said application so filed husband Deepak Garg filed objection on 12.05.2009 and then on 25.05.2009 Additional District Judge, Mathura rejected the application dated 08.05.2009 by holding that provision of Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act, are applicable even after dissolution of marriage under Section 13-B of HinduSmt.

Petitioner submits that against the same she preferred appeal and same was got dismissed as withdrawn on 29.06.2009. Petitioner filed reply to the said application filed by respondent-husband contending therein that respondent is not entitled to even see, and what to say to meet Km. Tulsi after consent decree of dissolution of marriage of the parties has been passed on 02.07.2009. To the said application also objections were filed to which rebuttal was also filed and thereafter application was moved by petitioner requesting therein to examine the minor daughter of petitioner in court. To the said application objections were filed and said has also been rejected. At this juncture present writ petition has been filed assailing the validity of aforesaid two orders. Counter affidavit has been filed and therein it has been stated that application has been filed for conferment of his visitation right in respect of minor Tulsi and it has been stated that petitioner intentionally avoided hearing and disposal of the proceedings. Husband in the past was constrained to file Civil Misc. Writ 20837 of 2009 wherein this Court on 21.04.2009 has directed expeditious disposal of application and in this background it has been stated that writ petition as it has been framed and drawn is liable to be dismissed. Rejoinder affidavit has been filed and therein averments mentioned in the counter affidavit has been disputed and it has been reiterated that entire amount in question has been invested for fetching better benefits, the applications have been wrongly rejected. After pleadings inter se parties have been exchanged present writ petition has been taken up for final hearing and disposal with the consent of the parties. Sri B.N. Agrawal, Advocate assisted by Sri Sanjay Agrawal Advocate contended with vehemence that in the present case in view of specific averments mentioned in paragraph 17 of the affidavit dated 28.05.2008 filed by respondent in proceeding under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act and decree having being passed in term of aforesaid averments mentioned in the affidavit, application under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act was clearly not maintainable and alternatively if view is taken that said application is maintainable then Additional District Judge was duty bound to take into account the wish of minor by examining her, in this background opinion which has been formed by Additional District Judge that such statement could not be recorded is totally misguided view and not subscribed by any rules applicable in this background order passed by Additional District Judge are liable to be quashed. Countering said submission Sri Nirvikar Gupta, Advocate representing sole respondent contended language of Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act on the face of it has got wide connotation and same takes within its folds both the stages i.e. pre decree stage and post decree stage and as such view taken on the said application moved under Section 26 Hindu Marriage Act was maintainable is correct view and same warrants no interference, and here visitation rights have been claimed, as such keeping in view the interest of minor i.e. her welfare and further in the fact of present case minor cannot be forced to be examined and as such view taken is correct view, and this court should refuse to interfere with the same, in the facts of present case.Smt. Payal Agrawal vs Deepak Garg on 18 January, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1141536/ 2After respective arguments have been advanced, first question to be adverted to is as to whether application which has been moved under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act is maintainable or not. For ready reference Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is being quoted below: Section 26. Custody of children.-In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and, make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible, and may, alter the decree, upon application by petition for the purpose: make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceeding for obtaining such decree were still pending, and the Court may, also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made. A bare perusal of the aforesaid provision quoted above would to go to show that the jurisdiction to make provision for custody, maintenance and education of minor under the section depends on the following requisites being fulfilled. (i) The application must be made in any proceedings under the Act and (ii) it must relate to 'minor children' Section 26 itself makes it clear that order contemplated by the section may be made, varied suspended or revoked from time to time and even after the termination of the proceedings by passing of any decree as if the proceedings were still pending. Alteration of decree has also been provided for. The decree contemplated in this section is not only a decree granting relief asked for in the petition, but also includes one dismissing a petition. The court has very wide powers under this section as regards custody of children, its maintenance and education. The primary and paramount consideration for the court in making any order under this section would be the welfare of the minor for which wide discretion has been conferred even before passing of decree and even after passing of decree in question for varying, suspending or revocation of the orders in question from time to time as alteration of decree has also been provided for. Whatever orders are passed are to be passed at both the stages are keeping the interest of children. Application moved under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act is thus, maintainable even after proceedings under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act have been finalized as in respect of child in question qua whom order of custody has been passed, discretion has been vested with the court to vary, suspend or revoke the said order. The Court exercises supervisory jurisdiction qua the welfare of the child and same does not cease to have jurisdiction even after passing of the decree. Based on the averments mentioned in the affidavit and decree it has been next contended that husband-respondent is estopped in law from moving such an application under Section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act. Relevant extract of affidavit mentioned in Paragraph-17 and relevant extract of judgment passed under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act are being looked into.Smt.

446,"Madras High Court Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi vs Smt. Kistamma on 9 November, 1972 Equivalent citations: (1973) 1 MLJ 300 Author: P Gokulakrishnan JUDGMENT P.R. Gokulakrishnan, J. 1. C.M.A. No. 348 of 1972 is against I.A. No. 2209 of 1971, on the file of the VI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, and C.R.P. No. 751 of 1972 is against I.A. No. 11534 of 1971, on the file of the same Court. Both the above I.As. were filed in O.P. No. 48 of 1971. O.P : No. 48 of 1971 now pending before the VI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, is a petition for restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act XXV of 1955. It was filed by the appellant, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi, for getting the society of his Wife Kistamma, the respondent, and her daughter by name Babarethinamma. 2. There is a long history behind between the parties prior to the filing of O.P. N0.48 of 1971. Their marriage took place as early as 1943 and according to Kistamma, a daughter was born to them on 23rd December, 1958. Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi filed O.P. No. 63 of 1960 on the file of the City Civil Court, Madras, for divorce, alleging adultery and desertion on the part of his wife, Kistamma. On the dismissal of that O.P. for divorce, C.M.A. No. 83 of 1961 was filed in this Court and that was also dismissed. In L.P.A. No. 31 of 1964, of this Court, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi was granted judicial separation. On further appeal by Kistamma to the Supreme Court in C.A. No. 1149 of 1969 the Supreme Court, by judgment dated 24th March, 1970, rejected the charges of adultery and immorality and desertion made against Kistamma and also negatived the contention of Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi regarding legitimacy of Babarethinamma. Subsequent to the judgment of the Supreme Court, notices seem to have passed between the parties, and Kistamma filed O.P. No. 25 of 1970, on the file of the Sub Court at Adoni for maintenance for herself and her daughter, claiming past maintenance of Rs. 36,000 and future maintenance at the rate of Rs. 1,000 per month from the date of petition. During January, 1(571, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi preferred O.P. No. 48 of 1971 before the City Civil Court, Madras, under Section 9 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. 3. In O.P. No. 48 of 1971, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi has inter alia alleged: ...His married life until now was one of misery. The several charges levelled against the petitioner by the respondent were the result of certain interested third parties being bent on ruining the career of the petitioner. The respondent made several reckless accusations against the petitioner and even went to the length of charging the petitioner of having a desire to marry another wife and that with a view to achieve that object, was anxious to get the respondent divorced. The history of events have shown that these accusations are all false. The petitioner has been, though married several years ago, constrained to live singly for several years in view of the intransigent and obstructive attitude of the respondent. He has undergone agony for several years.Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi vs Smt. Kistamma on 9 November, 1972 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1204246/ 1...His offer to take back the respondent is perfectly bona fide and the petitioner is ready and willing to forget and forgive all that had happened and is desirous of having the consortium of the respondent. ...The petitioner is only ready and willing to receive back the respondent and the child and to acknowledge the child as his, so as to enable the respondent and the child to have future status and happiness in life. The petitioner and respondent are closely related and the petitioner is also anxious to uphold the dignity and reputation of the family of both the petitioner and the respondent. On the above allegations, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi has prayed for restitution of conjugal rights. 4. Kistamma, the respondent in the C.M.A., no doubt, stated in her counter that the offer of Dr. H.T. Vira Reddi is wholly mala fide as he has filed the case in 1971 to defeat her right for maintenance after she had instituted an O.P. in the Sub Court, Adoni, earlier, and that she and her child have suffered mental shock and extreme loss of health as a result of the mental cruelty and in view of that fact, she apprehends great danger to the health and life of herself and her child. 5. Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi also filed I.A. No. 2209 of 1971 in his O.P. praying for staving further her petition O.P. No. 25 of 1970, on the file of the Sub-Court, Adoni. In the application, he inter alia alleged that the respondent's launching upon the proceeding in the Adoni Court will only result in multiplication of proceedings and a clear abuse of legal process and that having regard to the wide scope of inquiry in the petition for restitution of conjugal rights, wherein all questions will have to be tried out in giving relief of restitution of conjugal rights, the proceedings in O.P. No. 25 of 1970, on the file of the Sub-Court, Adoni, for maintenance and separate residence, can be stayed till the disposal of O.P. No. 48 of 1971. 6. O.P. No. 25 of 1970, on the file of the Sub-Court, Adoni, as already stated, is a pauper suit filed by Kistamma for maintenance under the general law. There she claims Rs. 36,000 as past maintenance and Rs. 1,000 per month as future maintenance for her and her daughter Babarethinamma. In the O.P. filed by Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi, Kistamma has also filed an application in I.A. No. 11534 of 1971 under Section 10, Civil Procedure Code for staying the proceeding in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 till the disposal of her O.P. No. 25 of 1970, alleging, inter alia, that O.P. No. 4.8 of 1971 has been filed with the sole object of defeating her claim for maintenance in O.P. No. 25 of 1970, that there is absolutely no bona fides on the part of Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi in praying for restitution of conjugal rights and that in any event the matter is directly and substantially the same in both the legal proceedings, viz., O.P. No. 25 of 1970, Sub-Court, Adoni and O.P. No. 48 of 1971, City Civil Court, Madras. She has also stated that her O.P. No. 25 of 1970 having been a previously instituted proceeding, O.P, No. 48 of 1971 has to be stayed. 7. In I.A. No. 11534 of 1971,the contention of Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi is that proceedings under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act is in a forum of special jurisdiction and not a suit in common law in a civil Court, whereas Kistamma's suit for arrears of maintenance is only general in character, that even otherwise the matters at issue in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 are not in common with those in O.P. No. 25 of 1970 and that in any view of the matter, the reliefs claimed in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 are of moreDr. H.T. Veera Reddi vs Smt. Kistamma on 9 November, 1972 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1204246/ 2comprehensive character and the decision one way or the other by the City Civil Court alone can give a cause of action for Kistamma being entitled to claim separate residence and maintenance, and not otherwise. He also contended that Section 10, Civil Procedure Code cannot apply in as much as the action in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 cannot be termed as a 'civil suit' and that the matters at issue are not directly or substantially the same as those which would arise in O.P. No. 25 of 1970. The further contention is that Kistamma's remedy can at all events be consequential to the decision of the matters at issue in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 and that as such Kistamma is not competent to take advantage of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and seek a stay of O.P. No. 48 of 1971. 8. The VI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, heard both the injunction application I.A. No. 3209 of 1971 as well as the Section 10 stay application I.A. No. 11534 of 1971 together, and dismissed both of them. This decision he arrived at on the ground that the matters arising in O.P. No. 25 of 1970 and in O.P. No. 48 of 1971 are not identical ones, and that both the proceedings can be prosecuted separately. The lower Court observed: The injunction to a party with respect to his taking part in the proceedings would be putting that party in a very inconvenient position. and that Kistamma cannot be prevented effectively by an order of injunction restraining her from prosecution of the petition for maintenance till the disposal of O.P. No. 48 of 1971. 9. Aggrieved by the decision rendered by the Court below, Dr. H.T. Veera Reddi has preferred the above C.M.A. and Kistamma has preferred the above Civil Revision Petition. 10. Thiru P. Venkataswami, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant in the C.M.A., took me through various provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and the Code of Civil Procedure and also through various decisions of Courts in support of the prayer of his client for the grant of an injunction against Kistamma. Thiru Sankaran, the learned Counsel for the respondent in the C.M.A., also took me through various decisions and argued that no injunction can be granted, which, if granted, will in effect, prohibit a Court not within the jurisdiction of this Court, from proceeding with the suit pending before it. 11. In Minohar Lal v. Seth Hiralal , the Supreme Court had occasion to deal with Section 10 and also Order 39, Rules 1 and 2, Civil Procedure Code. The majority view in that decision is that there is nothing in Order 39, Rules 1 and 2, which provides specifically that a temporary injunction is not to be issued in cases which are not mentioned in those rules and that the rules only provide that in circumstances mentioned in them the Court may grant a temporary injunction.. The Supreme Court has further held that the provision of Section 151, Civil Procedure Code make it clear that the inherent powers are not controlled by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and that it is a power inherent in the Court by virtue of its duty to do justice between the parties before it. Finally, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal' and observed-- In view of the various considerations stated above, we are of opinion that the order under appeal cannot be sustained and cannot be said to be an order necessary in the interests of justice or toDr. H.T.

R.P. SONDURBALDO TA, J ) : 1. The vexed question of law that arises for consideration in this appeal relates to right to claim maintenance of a Hindu woman who is married after coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to a Hindu male having a legally wedded wife. 2. The brief factual background against which the question is required to be considered is as follows : . In June, 1983 the appellant married the respondent at which time he already had a lawfully wedded wife living. The appellant and the respondent stayed together for a period of 17 years before they separated on 21st December, 1999. Then, the respondent filed M.J. Petition No. B-42 of 2000 in the Family Court, Mumbai for a declaration that his marriage with the appellant is null and void and for an injunction to restrain the appellant from representing herself as his wife and from visiting his place of residence, as also his work place. The appellant resisted the petition claiming ignorance of the78 vs Mr. Gokhale That Because The ... on 3 May, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/989161/ 2earlier marriage of the respondent. She contended that since the marriage ceremony was duly *3* FCA-117/2006 performed with her and the marriage was registered with the Registrar of Marriage, she is the legally wedded wife. She also alleged that she was deceived into the marriage by the respondent who had declared himself as a divorcee at the time of registration of the marriage. Along with the written statement, the appellant filed counterclaim praying for provision of separate residence and permanent alimony. She also sought permanent injunction to restrain the respondent from disposing off certain properties and creating third party rights over the same. 3. The Family Court by its judgment and decree dated 3rd August, 2006 partly allowed the petition of the respondent and rejected the counterclaim of the appellant. The Family Court found that marriage of the appellant with the respondent had taken place during the subsistence of the respondent's first marriage and consequently is void. However, it refused the declaration as sought by the respondent that the marriage is void in view of Section 23(a) and (d) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, on the ground that by filing the petition for nullity of the marriage, the *4* FCA-117/2006 respondent wanted to take advantage of his own wrong. Also there was unnecessary, unreasonable and improper delay in instituting the petition. The Family Court, however, restrained the appellant from visiting the respondent's place of residence and place of his work. 4. While considering the claim of the appellant for maintenance, though the application filed therefor was under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956, the question framed by the Family court for consideration was ""Whether the second wife can legally claim any maintenance amount under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. "" It then noted that the appellant was unable to cite any authority to justify the claim of second wife and answered the question without any further discussion stating that ""the legal position is almost settled that since the second marriage during subsistence of first one is void, the second wife does not get any rights as regards the maintenance. As a result, I hold that the respondent being the second wife of the petitioner is not *5* FCA-117/2006 entitled to any maintenance allowance."" Thereafter, Family Court considered the appellant's claim on merit also and rejected the same holding that she has sufficient income for her own maintenance. 5. When the present appeal was admitted on 12th December 2006, its admission was limited to the claim of the appellant for maintenance and to the order restraining the appellant from visiting the respondent's place of residence and work. The submissions on the appeal are further restricted to the claim of maintenance alone. No submissions have been advanced by either side on the order restraining the appellant from visiting the place of residence and work of the respondent.78 vs Mr. Gokhale That Because The ... on 3 May, 2010 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/989161/ 3","['23', '25', '18']"

By this appeal filed under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 the appellant seeks to challenge the judgment and decree dated 02.05.2009 whereby the petition filed by the respondent for divorce under Sections 13(1) (ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act was allowed by the learned trial court in favour of the respondent and against the appellant. 2. Brief facts of the case relevant for deciding the present appeal are that the parties got married on 16.4.94 in Delhi according to Hindu rites and ceremonies. It is the case of the respondent husband that the appellant wife started harassing him on one pretext or the other like demand for a separate residence, getting her pregnancy aborted without the consent of the respondent, alleging that her life has been ruined by marrying a simple clerk and other such imputations. It was also the case of the respondent that the appellant used to leave the matrimonial home time and again and hassled by the conduct of the appellant, the respondent filed a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion which vide judgment and decree dated 2.5.09 was granted in favour of the respondent. Feeling aggrieved with the same, the appellant has preferred the present appeal.Smt. Kavita vs Shri Rakesh Raman on 8 April, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/916384/ 13. Assailing the finding of the learned trial court in para-15 of the impugned judgment, Mr.Bhalla, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the civil suit referred to in the said para i.e. Ex.PW-1/A filed by the respondent for mandatory injunction was wrongly taken into consideration by the learned trial court as it was filed by the respondent just to create an evidence in his favour, as in the said suit the appellant was never served with the notice/summon and no evidence was produced by the respondent before the trial court to prove the fact that the appellant was served with the notice or had appeared in the matter. Assailing the finding of the learned trial court in para-16 of the impugned judgment, Mr.Bhalla stated that the order dated 11.06.2003 Ex.PW-1/C passed by the learned Magistrate in the criminal complaint filed by the appellant under Section 323/324/34 IPC is still under challenge before this Court in the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. filed by the appellant being Crl.M.C.No.696/2010 challenging the order of the learned trial court dismissing the application moved by the appellant under Section 319 Cr.P.C. to seek re-trial of the respondent. Counsel, however, admitted the fact that the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was filed by the appellant after the passing of the impugned judgment. Counsel also admitted that even the order of the learned Magistrate came to be passed after the passing of the impugned judgment. The contention of counsel for the appellant was that this order dated 11.06.2003 has not attained finality yet. 4. So far the institution of Kalandra Ex.PW-1/D dated 17.06.1999 by the appellant is concerned, as referred to in para-16 of the impugned judgment, counsel submitted that the appellant was well within her right to lodge/institute the Kalandara as the respondent, his father and brother came to the parental house of the appellant and committed the act of breach of peace and created a scene at that place, against which the police had taken action. Counsel thus submitted that the appellant-wife committed no wrong in lodging the said complaint against the respondent and the said accomplices. Counsel also submitted that the said kalandara proceedings were dropped by the Magistrate on 12.7.2000 on the technical ground that the Magistrate had failed to take a decision within the mandatory period of six months from the date of registration of the kalandara and therefore for the said dropping of the kalandara proceedings no fault can be attributed to the appellant. Counsel further submitted that the proceedings against the respondent and his family members are still pending trial under Section 498-A IPC in the court of Smt. Twinkle Wadhwan, M.M. and therefore even if the respondent and his family members were discharged under Section 406 of the IPC on 13.9.2000, the same would not have the effect of absolving them for the acts of cruelty committed by them. Counsel also submitted that simply because of the fact that there was acquittal of the respondent and his family members in a criminal case, that would not lead to the conclusion that an act of cruelty was committed by the appellant in getting the FIR registered against the respondent and his family members as it is the right given to a citizen under the law that whenever any criminal act is committed by the other party, to take recourse to filing of a compliant. Counsel also submitted that the learned trial court failed to appreciate the dictum of law laid down by this Court in Krishan Kumar Vs. Shankari II (2007) DMC 367, on the wrong analogy that filing of more criminal cases by the wife will amount to cruelty unlike in the case of Krishan Kumar (supra) where there was only one criminal case instituted by the wife against her husband. 5. Assailing the finding of the learned trial court in para 18 of the impugned judgment where it has held that the appellant said that her life was ruined by marrying a clerk and it caused cruelty to theSmt. Kavita vs Shri Rakesh Raman on 8 April, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/916384/ 2respondent, the counsel submitted that the respondent failed to prove that any such utterances were made by the appellant. The contention of the counsel was that no independent witness was produced by the respondent to prove that any such allegation was leveled by the appellant against the respondent. Counsel also submitted that in the written statement, this allegation has been duly refuted by the appellant. Counsel also submitted that the learned trial court wrongly gave weightage to the evidence of the respondent while ignoring the evidence of the appellant. The contention of the counsel was that if there is an evidence of one party against the other party i.e. oath vs. oath then in the absence of any corroboration, the evidence of one party cannot be accepted over the other. Further assailing the correctness of the finding given by the learned trial court in para 19 of the impugned judgment, the counsel submitted that the learned trial court has not given the details of the documentary evidence in the said para based on which the court made the observation that it is not the quantity but the quality of the witnesses which is to be weighed. Counsel further submitted that the documentary evidence which was placed on record by the respondent was manipulated by him and the same was self serving evidence and therefore the learned trial court ought not to have placed any reliance on such manipulative and self serving documentary evidence placed on record by the respondent. 6. Counsel for the appellant further submitted that the respondent admittedly failed to pay the amount of maintenance as granted by the learned trial court despite the grant of decree under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act but this fact was not considered by the learned trial court which fact would clearly prove that the respondent husband was trying to take advantage of his own wrongs and therefore he was not entitled to the grant of decree of divorce in terms of Section 23(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Counsel further submitted that the learned trial court in the said case under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act vide judgment dated 31.10.2002 took a view that the appellant in that case was able to show in her evidence that the respondent had illicit relationship with another woman and which fact became a cause of irritation between the parties and due to which the appellant was forced to leave her matrimonial house. The contention of the counsel was that the said finding of the court in the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Case has a binding effect in terms of Section 11 of CP.C and such an observation in the judgment in a case between the parties is also a relevant fact under Section 6 & 13 of the Indian Evidence Act. Counsel for the appellant in this regard invited attention of this court to paras 22, 33 & 34 of the judgment dated 31.10.2002 and submitted that perusal of the said paras would clearly reveal that the conduct of the respondent is out of bounds of the expected and reasonable conduct and based on the said observations of the court, he was not entitled to the grant of decree of divorce. Counsel further submitted that the appellant had also proved on record before the trial court that the respondent failed to pay the maintenance amount despite repeated applications moved by her before the concerned court in Section 18 proceedings and this deliberate act on the part of the respondent in not paying the maintenance amount even despite directions given by the maintenance court would clearly demonstrate the mala fide conduct of the respondent who wanted to pressurize the appellant to succumb to his dictates and to come under pressure to agree for divorce. Counsel also submitted that the appellant had placed on record the relevant order dated 15.04.2008 of the said court before the trial court by which direction for increase in the maintenance amount to Rs.4,000/- along with direction to clear the arrears of maintenance was given. Counsel also submitted that the judgment of the Apex Court cited by the appellant in the case of HirachandSmt.

449,"Gujarat High Court Jagdish Mangtani vs Geeta Jagdish Mangtani on 22 January, 2002 Equivalent citations: (2003) 1 GLR 309 Author: K Mehta Bench: K Mehta JUDGMENT K.M. Mehta, J. 1. Jagdish Mangtani appellant-husband (original petitioner) has filed this Second Appeal under Section 100 of C.P.C. against the judgment and decree dated 15-12-1999 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Kachchh at Gandhidham in Regular Civil Appeal No. 189 of 1999. The learned Judge by his impugned judgment and decree was pleased to allow the appeal filed by Smt. Geeta Jagdish Mangtani wife (original respondent). The learned Judge was pleased to quash and set aside the judgment and decree dated 18-6-1999 passed by the learned Civil Judge (S.D.), Gandhidham, in Hindu Marriage Petition No. 14 of 1998 filed by Shri Jagdish Mangtani appellant-husband. The learned trial Judge has passed a decree of divorce between the appellant and the respondent wife by dissolving their marriage as provided under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. 2. The facts giving rise to this petition are as under : 2.1 Marriage between Jagdish Mangtani-appellant husband and Geeta Jagdish Mangtani respondent-wife was solemnised on 2-11-1993 as per Hindu customs at Ulhasnagar, Mumbai. At the time of marriage the husband was working in shop at a meagre salary of Rs. 1400/- per month whereas the respondent-wife was serving as primary teacher at Adipur, Gandhidham, drawing salary of Rs. 7000/- per month. 2.2 As per the facts as emerging from the record the appellant-husband is residing with his parents and brothers in a joint family at Ulhasnagar, Mumbai. The respondent-wife originally is staying at Adipur, Gandhidham (Kutch). They both jointly stayed for some time in Mumbai. However, after the marriage the respondent took leave and came to Ulhasnagar and at that time she proposed the petitioner to settle at Adipur as she was serving in a primary school as teacher at Gandhidham. The petitioner did not agree to it that led to some dispute and difference and also led to quarrel between the appellant and the respondent. 2.3 It was submitted that somewhere in February, 1993 the respondent-wife conceived and ultimately on 2-6-1993 the wife went to her parents' house for the purpose of delivery and rest. However, after that the boy was born on 11-11-1993. The wife thereafter has not returned to matrimonial house and thereby the respondent-wife has deserted the husband. 2.4 From the record it appears that the appellant-husband addressed a notice dated 30-9-1996 through his Advocate to the respondent-wife at Exh. 21 in which it was stated that after the marriage the respondent-wife was interested in job as teacher in Nagarpalika school at Anjar and to settle at Adipur, and therefore, the respondent was pressurising the appellant-husband to resign his job and to settle in Adipur. As the appellant-husband was not agreeable for the same, quarrel started in this behalf.Jagdish Mangtani vs Geeta Jagdish Mangtani on 22 January, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1283489/ 12.5 The respondent-wife replied to the said notice on 14-10-1996 at Exh. 22 and denied the contention of the petitioner-husband. The respondent-wife has stated that she is prepared to stay at matrimonial house at Mumbai. 2.6 The appellant-husband has issued another notice dated 21-10-1996 to the respondent-wife which is at Exh. 23 and reiterated what has been stated in the notice dated 30-9-1996. It was stated that the respondent-wife has left her matrimonial house without any reasonable cause. It was reiterated that the appellant-husband has decided to settle at Ulhasnagar with his parents and he is not interested in resigning his present job and to reside at the in-law's house at Adipur as son-in-law. It appears that the respondent-wife has also replied to the said notice vide her letter dated 4-12-1996 denying the contentions in the said notice. The respondent-wife has stated that she is always ready to leave the job of Anjar and she is ready and willing to settle and live with the petitioner-husband. 2.7 In view of the above, ultimately the appellant-husband has filed petition for divorce. Originally, the appellant-husband filed petition being H.M.P. No. 754 of 1996 in the Court of Civil Judge (S.D.), Kalyan on the ground of desertion as contemplated under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The said petition was filed on 31-12-1996. In the said application the respondent-wife filed written statement on 14-9-1997 before the learned Civil Judge (S.D.), Kalyan. Ultimately, the same was transferred to the Court of Civil Judge (S.D.), at Gandhidham (Kutch) and numbered as H.M.P. No. 14 of 1998. 2.8 After the transfer of the petition to the Court of Civil Judge (S.D.) at Gandhidham-Kachchh, the appellant-husband was examined at Exh. 19. In the deposition also the husband stated that he is staying with his parents in a joint family and the wife was serving as a teacher at Gandhidham. The respondent-wife did not agree to stay at Ulhasnagar, Mumbai, and therefore, it led to quarrel between the appellant-husband and the respondent-wife. The appellant husband made efforts to bring the respondent-wife but she was not prepared to leave the job at Gandhidham and to come to her matrimonial home at Ulhasnagar. It was stated the appellant-husband was drawing salary of Rs. 1400/- per month whereas the respondent-wife was getting salary of Rs. 3000/- per month. 2.9 On behalf of the husband his brother Jetho Mangtani was also examined at Exh. 27. However, his evidence is not material and therefore, I am not referring to the same. Before the trial Court, respondent-wife Ms. Geetaben was examined at Exh. 29. In her deposition she has stated that at the time of her marriage the appellant was getting salary of Rs. 1400/- whereas she was getting salary of Rs. 7500/- and if she leaves the job of teacher at Gandhidham and goes to Ulhasnagar, Mumbai, it will not be possible for them to live in a joint family with the meagre salary of Rs. 14007- of the husband. It was also stated if the husband earns approximately Rs. 50007- then she is prepared to stay at Ulhasnagar in this behalf. Except maintenance there is no other dispute and difference in this behalf. It was admitted that from 2-6-1993 she has left matrimonial house and staying at Gandhidham. The respondent-wife has examined one Shri Popatlal who is a neighbour. However, his evidence is not relevant, and therefore, I am not referring to the same.Jagdish Mangtani vs Geeta Jagdish Mangtani on 22 January, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1283489/ 22.10 Before the trial Court the matter was heard and ultimately the trial Court framed the following issues which have been answered. (i) Whether the petitioner proves that the respondent has committed an act of cruelty with the petitioner? (ii) Whether the petitioner proves that the respondent has wilfully abandoned the petitioner? (iii) Whether the petitioner is entitled to a decree of divorce? (iv) What order? 2.10A The learned trial Judge while giving his finding has stated that the petitioner-appellant husband proved that the respondent-wife has committed the act of cruelty with the petitioner-husband. The petitioner-husband has also proved that the respondent-wife has lawfully abandoned the petitioner-appellant husband. 2.11 In view of the above, the trial Court has after considering the evidence on record, come to the conclusion that the petitioner-husband has been able to prove the ingredients of Section 13(1)(ia) and Section 13(1)(ib) of the Act and the petitioner-husband is entitled to a decree of divorce in this behalf. 3. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said judgment the respondent -wife filed appeal being Regular Civil Appeal No. 189 of 1999 before the Joint District Judge, Kachchh on 13-7-1999. The Joint District Judge, Kachchh at Gandhidham by his judgment and decree dated 15-12-1999 has held that the trial Court has erred in holding that the respondent-wife has committed an act of cruelty towards the petitioner-husband by abandoning the petitioner-husband and the petitioner-husband was entitled to obtain a decree of divorce. The learned appellate Judge also held that the learned trial Judge has not properly considered the fact that decree of divorce granted by the trial Court is improper and illegal. The learned appellate Judge has held that if a woman gets good designation or good job on the strength of her education and if a husband is not earning good income and is residing at another place after the marriage, wife cannot be compelled, according to orthodox Hindu mythology, to leave her good services or status and to stay at the husband's place. If a woman refuses to do so, she cannot be called upon to be ready for divorce. If it is so acted upon, it would be an insult to the woman's pride and it would amount to denial of a woman's right of equality. In view of the same, the learned appellate Judge has held that it cannot be said that the wife has abandoned her husband or has committed an act of cruelty towards the husband by abandoning the husband and the husband was entitled to obtain the decree of divorce. 4. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order of the learned appellate Judge, the appellant-husband has filed this Second Appeal before this Court. When the Second Appeal was admitted on 8-8-2000 the following substantial question of law was formulated by the then learned Judge which read as follows :Jagdish Mangtani vs Geeta Jagdish Mangtani on 22 January, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1283489/ 3","['13', '10']"

Mehta, J. 1. Bhargavkumar Pranshanker Shukla, appellant original petitioner has filed this appeal under provisions of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, against the judgment and decree dated 6th November, 1998, passed by the learned Judge, City Civil Court, Court No. 12, Ahmedabad, in Hindu Marriage Petition No. 262 of 1992. The learned Judge by his impugned judgment pleased to dismiss the said petition of divorce filed by petitioner-husband in this behalf. 2. The facts giving rise to this petition are as under :- 2.1 Marriage between Bhargavkumar Pranshanker Shukla - appellant husband (original petitioner) and Chhayaben Bhargavkumar Shukla - respondent-wife (original opponent) was solemnised on 30th January, 1982, as per Hindu rites at Ahmedabad. The opponent-wife gave birth to a female child in December, 1982 whose name is ""Vaacha"". 2.2 It appears that there was some difference and dispute between petitioner-husband and respondent-wife. They have also some difference and dispute between respondent-wife and her father-in-law and mother-in-law at the matrimonial home. It appears from the record that the opponent wife did not like to stay with the father-in-law and mother-in-law in a joint family. In view of the same, petitioner-husband took a new house somewhere in February, 1984 and decided to live separately from his parents. 2.2(A) Somewhere in March, 1984 petitioner's younger brother was going to America and at that time it was decided that all family members excepting the parties to this proceedings should go to Bombay to give send off and parties to this proceedings should only go to Ahmedabad Railway Station for the same. At the relevant time, the opponent wife had insisted that the petitioner must not go to Ahmedabad Railway Station also. In view of the same, there was a quarrel between petitioner husband and respondent-wife and the respondent had thrown tripoy or small table against the petitioner in this behalf. The fact which is emerged from the record that both the petitioner and the opponent did not went to Railway Station to send off the younger brother of the petitioner. 2.3 In view of the aforesaid circumstances, petitioner decided to go to Bombay to give send off by Air, the respondent had threatened not to go or else she would sprinkle kerosene on her body. In view of the aforesaid threat, the petitioner had to take the opponent in auto-rickshaw to her parent's house to place her there. Thereafter, he locked the house and went to Bombay. After husband left for Bombay wife went to the house of husband and took some clothes and ornaments from that house. However, after husband came from Bombay, from the record it appears that the wife has not returned to her matrimonial home despite the husband has made several efforts in this behalf.Bhargavkumar Pranshankar Shukla vs Chhayaben Bhargavkumar Shukla on 21 October, 2002 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1032433/ 12.4 From the record, it appears that, since March, 1984 the relation between petitioner and opponent was not cordial. The husband made several efforts to see that both opponent and her daughter return to matrimonial home. 2.5 The petitioner had also addressed a notice dated 25th May, 1986 (Exh. 45) which was received by opponent on 31st May, 1986 in which also all the facts were stated and also indicated that if wife will not return the matrimonial home the petitioner will entitle to file appropriate proceedings. The wife also filed reply on 6th June, 1986 (Exh. 47) denying the contentions raised by the petitioner in this behalf. The wife specifically stated that after March, 1984 her husband has not made an effort to bring her at her matrimonial home, and therefore, the claims lie with the petitioner husband. The petitioner also gave another notice dated 19th September, 1986 in this behalf (Exh. 48). 2.6 Ultimately, on August 1992 the applicant-husband filed present Hindu Marriage Petition No. 262 of 1992 before the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad for obtaining divorce against the opponent. In the said application, all the facts which I have narrated earlier in Paras 2.2, 2.2(A), 2.3, 2.4 & 2.5 are stated. I, therefore, did not repeat the contents of the petition to the said extent. In the petition it has been specifically stated as regards incidence regarding March, 1984 when brother of the applicant was going abroad there was difference and dispute as opponent did not allow the applicant to go to Station to give send off to his brother. A quarrel took place on that day and ultimately at late night the applicant decided to go to Bombay by early next morning by plane and at that time the applicant took opponent in rickshaw and put her at her parent's house. It was stated that during the absence when he was in Bombay the opponent came to her matrimonial home and took all clothes, ornaments, fixed deposit receipts, utensils and cash and all other documents and also daughter's clothes and ornaments and went to her parent's house. After the applicant returned from Bombay the applicant went to opponent's house and requested her to come back to the matrimonial home, however, the opponent-wife refused to come to the matrimonial home in this behalf. 2.6(A) It was, therefore, stated that right from March 1984 the opponent has not stayed with her husband at the matrimonial home though husband has made numerous efforts himself and also through his family members. However, without any reasonable cause, the opponent-wife has abandoned the applicant for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately proceeding the presentation of the present petition. In fact, in this case, the petition has been filed in 1990 and the opponent has left the matrimonial home right from 1984. To that extent, the applicant is deprived of his happiness of matrimonial home in absence of opponent since 1984. The opponent has also treated the applicant physical as well as mental cruelty due to the long absence from the matrimonial home. In fact, the opponent did not allow the applicant to see his daughter also and instigated to his daughter not to see his father in this behalf.

This is an appeal under clause 10 of the Letters Patent from the judgment and decree, dated April 15, 1964 of a learned Single Judge. It arises out of a petition by th husband, Jogindar Singh appellant under section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Act 25 of 1955), hereinafter to be referred as 'the Act' for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights between the parties, that is to say, the appellant and his wife. Pushpa respondent for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding to which they were parties. 2. The appellant made a petition under section 9(1) of the Act against the respondent for a decree for restitution of conjugal rights on the allegation that she had, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from his society. The parties were married on June 25, 1958, and lived together only up to October of that year at the village of the appellant, where after the respondent left the house of the appellant. It was in January 1960 the appellant made the petition under section 9(1) of the Act. The parties appeared before the trial Court on May 18, 1960. The appellant made this statement in Court - ""I want to keep the respondent (wife) with me. I will never maltreat her in future. But it should not be taken that I have maltreated her. I am ready to settle her happily after forgetting all the previous matters. I promise before the Court that I will not maltreat her in future."" On that the respondent made this statement- ""It is stated that the respondent (wife) is prepared to go along with the petitioner (husband). The petitioner had turned her out of the house. I am ready to stay with the petitioner forgetting all the previous matters."" The trial Court then immediately proceeded to give the judgment the operative part of which reads - ""At the time of framing of the issues, the petitioner and the respondent made a statement before the Court that they wanted to live together. The petitioner assured the Court as well as the respondent that he shall try to forget the past though they were not agreed as to whether the petitioner had been treating the respondent with cruelty or not. As such in accordance with the statements of the parties the petition of restitution of conjugal rights is accepted. No order is made as to costs as the same were not pressed before me on behalf of the petitioner.' A decree in the terms of the judgment followed of which the copy is Exhibit A/4. It reads - ""this suit (petition) coming on the this date (May 18, 1960) for final disposal before me (Shri Manohar Lal Mirchia, B. A. LL B. P. C. S., Subordinate Judge 1st Class Hoshiarpur) in the presence of Shari Brahma Nand Advocate for the petitioner and Shri Ajit Singh Bains Advocate for the defendant (respondent), it is ordered that in accordance with the statements of the parties, the petitioner is granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. No order is made as to costs."" 3. An application, dated May 30, 1960. To execute the decree was made by the appellant in the executing Court on June 1, 1960, but it was returned on account of some formal defect and was actually received back for hearing on June 3, 1960, on which date order was made for notice of it to the respondent. Now, the file for the execution application has not on it any process which showsJoginer Singh vs Pushpa on 20 March, 1968 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1831913/ 1service of the notice on the respondent. But on the notice on July 6, 1960, when the application came up for hearing before the Court, Shri Ajit Singh Bains Advocate for the respondent made the statement that ""Smt Pushpa Devi respondent is prepared to go with the decree-holder (appellant) at the very moment. The decree holder (appellant) may take her with him.."" This statement is signed by Shri Ajit Singh Bains. This is followed by a statement by Shri Brahma Nand Advocate for the appellant that the respondent's brother Karam Singh should take the respondent to the house o the appellant and leave her there, explaining that if the appellant himself took the respondent with him, there was apprehension that the relations of the parties right become strained. He then added that the respondent alone could go with the decree holder. The statement is signed by him. The executing Court thereupon directed the respondent to accompany the appellant saying that the latter was prepared to take her along with him. On that Shri Brahma band Advocate for the appellant made a statement that no further proceedings were a needed in the execution application, ant the executing Court then proceeded to order the dismissal of the execution application, again saying that the parties may go together. This is obviously dated July 6, 1960, in the name of the appellant but signed by Shri Brahma Nand Advocate. Its contents are so worded that the meaning is not immediately clear, but signed by Shri Brahma Nand Advocate. Its contents are so worded that the meaning is not immediately clear, but it appears to be an application made on behalf of the appellant in reply to some application by the respondent, and it was said on the side of the appellant that the respondent was merely making a pretence and she was not, in good faith, willing to go with the appellant. Although this application is on the execution file, but there is no order of the Court on it. There is, however, on the back of it a faint round marking of the seal of what appears to be the seal of the Court. When the parties appeared as witness during the hearing of the petition under section 13 of the Act, no question about this application was put to the appellant. On the next day, that is to say on July 7,1960, the appellant made another application in the executing Court, signed by himself as also by his Advocate. Shri Brahma Nand, saying that although the respondent had agreed on the previous day to go with him and therefore, he had the execution application dismissed, but,. When outside the Court, she refused to accompany him. The prayer was that the application be made a part of the execution file. On July 9, 1960, the executing Court proceeded to make the order - ""No action can be taken, file."" This was the end of the first execution application by the appellant to execute the decree in his favour for restitution of conjugal rights against the respondent. 4. The second application to execute the decree was made by the appellant on October 25-27, 1961. On notice of this application, the respondent appeared in Court on June 9, 1962 and stated clearly that she was not prepared to go with the appellant and that the question of her going with him did not arise because he had previously insulted her. So she refused to go along with the appellant. Copy of this second execution application is Exhibit A/1. And that of the statement of the respondent is Exhibit A/3. 5. In the meantime the appellant had on May 25, 1962, made the petition under section 13 of the Act seeking a decree for dissolution of marriage by way of divorce from the respondent. The case of the appellant was simple that in spite of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights made on May 18, 1960, and in spite of his having taken out execution of that decree the respondent had failed to comply with the decree for a period of more than two years, and had rather started proceedingsJoginer Singh vs Pushpa on 20 March, 1968 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1831913/ 2against him under section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for maintenance. In her defence the respondent admitted the previous proceedings under section 9 of the Act and further stated that on the assurance of the father of the appellant a retired Sub-Divisional Officer, and his brother a subordinate Judge, she agreed to live with the appellant. The written reply then goes on to say- ""As soon as the respondent came out of the Court after making her statement and asked the petitioner (appellant) to take her along with him, the petitioner refused there and then. It was brought to the notice of the Court of the Subordinate Judge in whose Court the petition was pending. Thereafter the petitioner came along with the respondent and lived there till August 1960, and finally left the house on the pretext of meeting his parents and never returned."" At the trial the respondent clarified this by saying that after the parties left the Court on May 18, 1960, the appellant accompanied her and her brother Karam Singh to the house off the last-named in Model House locality in Jullundur where he stayed with them for two months and then deserted her. The appellant filed a replication in which he gave a complete denial to the allegations of the respondent as above in her written reply and said that """"he respondent never resided with petitioner (appellant) at Jullundur or any other place, after the passing of that decree. The allegations of residing together at Jullundur as at Jullundur trying her application under section 488, Criminal Procedure Code. There was no question of residing together at Jullundur, as the petitioner never had any permanent or even temporary abode at the place."" The parties led evidence, but the learned District Judge in his judgment of June 6, 1963, described the version of the respondent and her witnesses that after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights on May 18, 1960, the appellant accompanied the respondent and her brother to the house of the last named at Jullundur and, staying there for two months left the respondent of his own. The learned Judge believed the appellant that he had taken out the first execution application of which the respondent had knowledge and even though at that time she had agreed in Court, a second time, to go along with the appellant and live with him, she never did so and parted company with the appellant immediately as they came out of the court-room. At the time of the second execution application she made an unabashed statement that she was not, in any event, prepared to go back to the appellant, the learned Judge, believed, excepting one, the witnesses of the respondent and, coming to the conclusion that in the first execution application of the appellant no notice was really served on the respondent nor did she ever appear in the Court, accepted the version of the respondent and her brother Karam Singh that after the Court passed the decree for restitution of conjugal rights, the parties accompanied Karam Singh, brother of the respondent, to his house in Model House locality in Jullundur, where the appellant stayed with the respondent for a period of about two months, and then left her on a pretence, never returning to her but, instead, petitioning for a decree of divorce from her. So the learned Judge reversed the decree of the trial Court and dismissed the petition of the appellant on April 15, 1964. 6. The appellant's appeal under clause 10 of the Letters Patent from the decree of the learned Single Judge first came for hearing before a my learned brother, Pandit J., and myself. During the hearing of the appeal, our attention was drawn to the observation of the learned Single Judge, that a decree for restitution of conjugal rights was granted by consent. I have a considerable doubt whether this could be done. On the side obviously of the respondent the contention was that a consent decree for restitution of conjugal rights is not a valid and an enforceable decree. We did not at that time decide the question whether the decree for restitution of conjugal rights between the parties made on May 18, 1960, was or was not a consent decree, but on April 14, 1967, we referred these two questions to aJoginer Singh vs Pushpa on 20 March, 1968 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1831913/ 3",['10']
