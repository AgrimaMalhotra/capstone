valid marriage under the personal law of the parties have been gone into in this case, although the marriage is null and void by reason of the provisions of sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This Act was passed with the object of amending and modifying the law relating to marriages among Hindus. Under the customary law, there was no restriction for a male Hindu to marry more than one women. This right of the Hindu husband under the customary Hindu Law was curtailed for the first time in the then Bombay Province by enacting the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriage Act, 1946, provisions whereof declared bigamy to be illegal. Under the provisions of the said Act and other similar laws enacted by other Provincial Legislatures, a second marriage by a Hindu person during the life time of the spouse was declared illegal and going through such a marriage was made penal. Consistent with the object of codifying the marriage laws amongst Hindus, all these State laws were repealed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for the conditions for solemnisation of marriage between any two Hindus. Section 11 declares that a marriage solemnised after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void if it contravenes any of conditions specified in Clause (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5. One of the conditions for a marriage as required by section 5 is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage, and this is condition No. (i) in section 5. Section 11 also gives a remedy to either party to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration by a decree of nullity of marriage on any one of the said three conditions of section 5 being shown to the have been contravened. Obviously, the second marriage in such circumstances being void, it cannot create a legal status of husband and wife between the parties. It is true that section 11 also gives a right to the parties to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration of nullity by a decree of the Court , but the filing of the petition or passing the decree is not a condition precedent for putting an end to the marriage. What ultimately is declared on such a petition is nothing but the status of the party as on the date of the marriage, and therefore, the marriage does not continue to remain valid until a decree is passed. What is null and void cannot be deemed to be in existence for any purposes whatsoever. Under the circumstances, if a marriage is solemnised in contravention of any of the said three conditions referred to in section 5(i), the woman cannot get the status of the wife nor the male gets the status of a husband qua her. The second marriage does not continue to be valid till the passing of the decree for a nullity. The position is also clear from the fact that bigamy is made penal by section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides that any marriage between two Hindu solemnised after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living and the provisions of sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly. The position is made further clear from the anxiety of the legislature to protect children of such a marriage by providing in section 16 that not withstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. However, the rights of such a child are somewhat curtailed in the matter of inheritance to the property, because sub-section (3) of section 16 says that a child of such a marriage would not be entitled to any rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Having regard to all these provisions, the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent was void ab initio and the respondent could not get the status of a legally wedded wife inspite of the solemnisation of the marriage under the Hindu Law having gone into. Indeed, Mr. Gavnekar did not dispute this legal position. He, however, contended that the provisions of section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act conferred a right of maintenance on the second wife and the word \"wife\" in section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to be given a wider meaning as including a Hindu wife whose marriage may be otherwise void.'\n","example=pre_process(example)\n","encodings = tokenizer.encode_plus(\n","    example,\n","    None,\n","    add_special_tokens=True,\n","    max_length=MAX_LEN,\n","    padding='max_length',\n","    return_token_type_ids=True,\n","    truncation=True,\n","    return_attention_mask=True,\n","    return_tensors='pt'\n",")\n","model.eval()\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","    input_ids = encodings['input_ids'].to(device, dtype=torch.long)\n","    attention_mask = encodings['attention_mask'].to(device, dtype=torch.long)\n","    token_type_ids = encodings['token_type_ids'].to(device, dtype=torch.long)\n","    output = model(input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids)\n","    final_output = torch.sigmoid(output).cpu().detach().numpy().tolist()\n","    output=np.flip(np.argsort(final_output,axis=1)[0][-5:])\n","    for i in output:\n","      print(\"Section \"+ train_df.columns[1:].to_list()[i])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["11\n","5\n","25\n","16\n","3\n"]}]}]}
